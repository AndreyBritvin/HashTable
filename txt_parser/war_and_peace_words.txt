introduction
if
the
world
could
write
by
itself
it
would
write
like
tolstoy
isaac
babel
war
and
peace
is
the
most
famous
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
daunting
of
russian
novels
as
vast
as
russia
itself
and
as
long
to
cross
from
one
end
to
the
other
yet
if
one
makes
the
journey
the
sights
seen
and
the
people
met
on
the
way
mark
ones
life
forever
the
book
is
set
in
the
period
of
the
napoleonic
wars
18051812
and
tells
of
the
interweaving
of
historical
events
with
the
private
lives
of
two
very
different
families
of
the
russian
nobilitythe
severe
bolkonskys
and
the
easygoing
rostovsand
of
a
singular
man
reminiscent
of
the
author
himselfcount
pierre
bezukhov
it
embodies
the
national
myth
of
russias
glorious
period
as
tolstoy
himself
called
it
in
the
confrontation
of
the
emperor
napoleon
and
field
marshal
kutuzov
and
at
the
same
time
it
challenges
that
myth
and
all
such
myths
through
the
vivid
portrayal
of
the
fates
of
countless
ordinary
people
of
the
period
men
and
women
young
and
old
french
as
well
as
russian
and
through
the
authors
own
passionate
questioning
of
the
truth
of
history
tolstoy
wrote
that
he
spent
five
years
of
ceaseless
and
exclusive
labor
under
the
best
conditions
of
life
working
on
war
and
peace
those
were
the
years
from
1863
to
1868
he
was
thirtyfive
when
he
began
the
year
before
he
had
married
sofya
behrs
the
daughter
of
a
moscow
doctor
who
was
eighteen
and
they
had
moved
permanently
to
his
estate
at
yasnaya
polyana
in
tula
province
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
south
of
moscow
she
bore
him
four
children
while
he
worked
on
the
book
was
his
first
reader
or
listener
and
was
in
model
for
his
heroine
natasha
rostov
the
orderliness
and
routine
of
family
life
and
estate
management
were
not
only
the
best
conditions
for
work
they
were
also
new
conditions
for
tolstoy
his
mother
had
died
when
he
was
two
his
father
had
moved
to
moscow
with
the
children
in
1830
but
died
himself
seven
years
later
and
the
children
were
eventually
taken
to
kazan
by
their
aunt
tolstoy
entered
kazan
university
in
1844
but
never
graduated
his
later
attempts
to
pass
examinations
at
petersburg
university
also
led
to
nothing
in
1851
after
several
years
of
idle
and
dissipated
life
in
moscow
and
petersburg
he
visited
the
caucasus
with
his
brother
nikolai
who
was
in
the
army
and
there
took
a
raid
on
a
chechen
village
which
he
described
a
year
later
in
a
story
entitled
the
raid
his
first
attempt
to
capture
the
actuality
of
warfare
in
words
his
experiences
in
the
caucasus
were
also
reflected
in
his
novel
the
cossacks
which
he
began
writing
in
1853
but
finished
only
nine
years
later
and
in
his
very
last
piece
of
fiction
the
superb
short
novel
hadji
murad
completed
in
1904
but
published
only
posthumously
in
1852
he
joined
the
army
as
a
noncommissioned
officer
and
served
in
wallachia
two
years
later
he
was
promoted
to
ensign
and
was
transferred
at
his
own
request
to
the
crimea
where
he
fought
in
the
crimean
war
and
was
present
at
the
siege
of
sevastopol
his
sevastopol
sketches
which
were
published
in
1855
made
him
famous
in
petersburg
social
and
literary
circles
they
were
a
second
and
fuller
attempt
at
a
true
depiction
of
war
during
his
army
years
tolstoy
lived
like
a
typical
young
russian
officer
drinking
gambling
and
womanizing
in
1854
he
lost
the
family
house
in
yasnaya
polyana
at
cards
and
it
was
dismantled
and
moved
some
twenty
miles
away
leaving
only
a
foundation
stone
on
which
tolstoy
later
had
carved
here
stood
the
house
in
which
l
n
tolstoy
was
born
in
1856
he
was
promoted
to
lieutenant
but
resigned
his
commission
and
returned
to
the
estate
where
he
lived
in
one
of
the
surviving
wings
of
the
house
and
began
to
occupy
himself
with
management
and
the
education
of
the
peasant
children
by
then
besides
the
works
i
have
already
mentioned
he
had
also
published
the
semifictional
trilogy
childhood
boyhood
and
youth
the
years
from
1857
to
1862
were
a
time
of
restlessness
and
seeking
for
tolstoy
he
had
left
petersburg
disgusted
by
the
literary
life
there
he
made
two
trips
abroad
during
the
first
in
1857
he
forced
himself
to
witness
a
public
execution
in
paris
and
the
sight
shook
him
so
deeply
that
he
vowed
he
would
never
again
serve
any
government
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
trip
in
september
1860
he
visited
his
beloved
brother
nikolai
who
was
dying
of
tuberculosis
in
the
southern
french
town
of
hy232res
the
death
and
burial
of
his
brother
were
he
said
the
strongest
impression
in
my
life
in
1861
he
returned
to
yasnaya
polyana
where
he
began
work
on
a
novel
about
the
decembrists
a
group
of
young
aristocrats
and
officers
who
at
the
death
of
the
emperor
alexander
i
in
december
1825
rose
up
in
the
name
of
constitutional
monarchy
were
arrested
and
either
executed
or
sent
to
siberia
this
novel
would
eventually
become
war
and
peace
tolstoy
himself
later
described
the
process
of
its
transformation
at
first
he
had
wanted
to
write
about
a
decembrist
on
his
return
from
siberia
in
1856
when
the
exiles
were
pardoned
by
alexander
ii
in
preparation
for
that
he
went
back
to
1825
the
year
of
the
uprising
itself
and
from
there
to
the
childhood
and
youth
of
his
hero
and
the
others
who
took
it
that
brought
him
to
the
war
of
1812
with
which
he
became
fascinated
and
since
those
events
were
directly
linked
to
events
of
1805
it
was
there
that
he
decided
to
begin
the
original
title
in
the
serial
publication
of
the
book
was
the
year
1805
it
was
only
in
1867
that
he
changed
it
to
war
and
peace
which
he
may
have
borrowed
from
a
work
by
the
french
socialist
thinker
pierrejoseph
proudhon
whom
he
had
met
in
brussels
during
his
second
trip
abroad
all
that
remains
of
the
decembrists
in
the
final
version
are
some
slight
hints
about
the
futures
of
pierre
bezukhov
and
of
prince
andrei
bolkonskys
son
nikolenka
the
book
grew
organically
as
tolstoy
worked
on
it
in
1865
partly
under
the
influence
of
stendhals
charterhouse
of
parma
he
revised
the
battle
scenes
he
had
already
written
and
added
new
ones
including
one
of
the
most
important
the
description
of
the
battle
of
sch246ngraben
coming
across
a
collection
of
masonic
texts
in
the
library
of
the
rumyantsev
museum
he
became
interested
and
decided
to
make
pierre
bezukhov
a
mason
he
studied
the
people
of
moscow
at
the
theaters
in
the
clubs
in
the
streets
looking
for
the
types
he
needed
a
great
many
of
his
fictional
characters
if
not
all
of
them
had
reallife
models
the
old
prince
bolkonsky
and
the
old
count
rostov
were
drawn
from
tolstoys
grandfathers
nikolai
rostov
and
princess
marya
from
his
parents
sonya
from
one
of
his
aunts
the
rostov
estate
otradnoe
is
a
reflection
of
yasnaya
polyana
tolstoy
spent
two
days
on
the
battlefield
of
borodino
and
made
his
own
map
of
the
disposition
of
forces
correcting
the
maps
of
the
historians
he
collected
a
whole
library
of
materials
on
the
napoleonic
wars
many
bits
of
which
also
found
their
way
into
the
fabric
of
the
book
his
memory
for
historical
minutiae
was
prodigious
but
above
all
there
is
the
profusion
and
precision
of
sensual
detail
that
brings
the
world
of
war
and
peace
so
vividly
to
life
in
his
autobiographical
sketch
people
and
situations
1956
pasternak
wrote
of
tolstoy
all
his
life
at
every
moment
he
possessed
the
faculty
of
seeing
phenomena
in
the
detached
finality
of
each
separate
instant
in
perfectly
distinct
outline
as
we
see
only
on
rare
occasions
in
childhood
or
on
the
crest
of
an
allrenewing
happiness
or
in
the
triumph
of
a
great
spiritual
victory
to
see
things
like
that
our
eye
must
be
directed
by
passion
for
it
is
passion
that
by
its
flash
illuminates
an
object
intensifying
its
appearance
such
passion
the
passion
of
creative
contemplation
tolstoy
constantly
carried
within
him
it
was
precisely
in
its
light
that
he
saw
everything
in
its
pristine
freshness
in
a
new
way
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
authenticity
of
what
he
saw
differs
so
much
from
what
we
are
used
to
that
it
may
appear
strange
to
us
but
tolstoy
was
not
seeking
that
strangeness
was
not
pursuing
it
as
a
goal
still
less
did
he
apply
it
to
his
works
as
a
literary
method
i
was
struck
while
working
on
the
translation
of
war
and
peace
by
the
impression
that
i
was
translating
two
books
at
the
same
time
not
two
books
in
alternation
as
one
might
expect
from
the
title
but
two
books
simultaneously
one
is
a
very
deliberate
and
selfconscious
work
expressive
of
the
outsize
personality
of
its
author
who
is
everywhere
present
selecting
and
manipulating
events
and
making
his
own
absolute
pronouncements
on
them
on
the
twelfth
of
june
the
forces
of
western
europe
crossed
the
borders
of
russia
and
war
beganthat
is
an
event
took
place
contrary
to
human
reason
and
to
the
whole
of
human
nature
it
is
a
work
full
of
provocation
and
irony
and
written
in
what
might
be
called
tolstoys
signature
style
with
broad
and
elaborately
developed
rhetorical
devicesperiodic
structure
emphatic
repetitions
epic
similes
the
other
is
an
account
of
all
that
is
most
real
and
ordinary
in
life
all
that
is
most
fragile
and
therefore
most
precious
all
that
eludes
formulation
that
is
not
subject
to
absolute
pronouncements
that
is
so
mercurial
that
it
can
hardly
be
reflected
upon
and
can
be
grasped
only
by
a
rare
quality
of
attention
and
selfeffacement
and
it
is
written
in
a
style
that
reaches
the
expressive
minimum
of
a
sentence
like
k225pli
k225pali
drops
drippedwhich
makes
silence
itself
audible
it
seems
to
me
that
the
incomparable
experience
of
reading
war
and
peace
comes
from
the
shining
of
the
one
work
through
the
otheran
effect
achieved
by
artistic
means
of
an
unusual
sort
the
first
thing
a
reader
today
must
overcome
is
the
notion
of
war
and
peace
as
a
classic
the
greatest
of
novels
and
the
model
of
what
a
novel
should
be
in
1954
bertolt
brecht
wrote
a
note
on
classical
status
as
an
inhibiting
factor
that
puts
the
question
nicely
what
gets
lost
he
says
of
the
bestowing
of
classical
status
on
a
work
he
is
speaking
of
works
for
the
theater
is
the
classics
original
freshness
the
element
of
surpriseof
newness
of
productive
stimulus
that
is
the
hallmark
of
such
works
the
passionate
quality
of
a
great
masterpiece
is
replaced
by
stage
temperament
and
where
the
classics
are
full
of
fighting
spirit
here
the
lessons
taught
the
audience
are
tame
and
cozy
and
fail
to
grip
the
first
readers
of
war
and
peace
were
certainly
surprised
but
often
also
bewildered
and
even
dismayed
by
the
book
they
found
it
hard
to
identify
the
main
characters
to
discover
anything
like
a
plot
to
see
any
connection
between
episodes
to
understand
the
sudden
leaps
from
fiction
to
history
from
narration
to
philosophizing
there
seemed
to
be
no
focus
no
artistic
unity
to
the
work
no
real
beginning
and
no
resolution
it
was
as
if
the
sheer
mass
of
detail
overwhelmed
any
design
tolstoy
might
have
tried
to
impose
on
it
such
observations
were
made
by
russian
critics
including
tolstoys
great
admirer
ivan
turgenev
and
when
the
book
became
known
in
translation
they
were
repeated
by
flaubert
and
by
henry
james
who
famously
described
war
and
peace
as
a
large
loose
baggy
monster
another
cause
of
surprise
for
its
first
readers
was
the
language
of
war
and
peace
the
book
opens
in
frenchnot
with
a
few
words
of
french
as
in
those
english
versions
that
do
not
eliminate
the
french
altogether
but
with
a
whole
paragraph
of
french
with
only
a
few
phrases
of
russian
at
the
end
this
mixing
of
french
and
russian
goes
on
for
another
five
chapters
or
more
and
occurs
frequently
throughout
the
rest
of
the
book
there
are
also
some
long
letters
entirely
in
french
as
well
as
official
dispatches
and
quotations
from
the
french
historian
adolphe
thiers
there
are
passages
in
german
as
well
for
all
of
them
tolstoy
supplied
his
own
translations
in
footnotes
as
we
do
but
that
made
the
question
still
more
problematic
because
tolstoys
translations
are
occasionally
inaccurate
perhaps
deliberately
so
the
amount
of
french
in
the
text
is
smaller
than
some
early
critics
assertednot
a
third
but
only
about
two
percent
but
there
is
also
a
great
deal
of
gallicized
russian
either
implying
that
the
speaker
is
speaking
in
french
or
showing
that
upperclass
ladies
like
julie
karagin
are
unable
to
write
correctly
in
their
own
language
and
there
are
other
heterogeneous
elements
in
the
composition
tolstoys
map
and
commentary
on
the
battlefield
of
borodino
and
his
own
interpolated
essays
which
repeatedly
disrupt
the
fictional
continuum
the
formal
structure
of
war
and
peace
and
the
texture
of
its
prose
are
indeed
strange
those
who
did
not
simply
declare
the
book
a
failure
dismissing
the
newness
the
passionate
quality
and
fighting
spirit
of
what
tolstoy
was
doing
as
artistic
helplessness
and
na239vet233
often
said
that
it
succeeded
in
spite
of
its
artistic
flaws
but
that
is
a
false
distinction
war
and
peace
is
a
work
of
art
and
if
it
succeeds
it
cannot
be
in
spite
of
its
formal
deficiencies
but
only
because
tolstoy
created
a
new
form
that
was
adequate
to
his
vision
it
is
equally
mistaken
to
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
declare
as
more
recent
critics
have
done
that
far
from
being
a
magnificent
failure
war
and
peace
is
a
masterpiece
of
nineteenthcentury
realism
simple
and
artless
a
direct
transcription
of
life
tolstoy
was
well
aware
of
the
perplexities
his
book
caused
and
addressed
them
in
an
article
included
here
as
an
appendix
entitled
a
few
words
apropos
of
the
book
war
and
peace
published
in
the
magazine
russian
archive
in
1868
before
the
final
parts
of
the
book
had
appeared
in
print
what
is
war
and
peace
he
asked
it
is
not
a
novel
still
less
an
epic
poem
still
less
a
historical
chronicle
war
and
peace
is
what
the
author
wanted
and
was
able
to
express
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
expressed
such
a
declaration
of
the
authors
disregard
of
the
conventional
forms
of
artistic
prose
works
might
seem
presumptuous
if
it
were
premeditated
and
if
it
had
no
previous
examples
the
history
of
russian
literature
since
pushkins
time
not
only
provides
many
examples
of
such
departure
from
european
forms
but
does
not
offer
even
one
example
to
the
contrary
from
gogols
dead
souls
to
dostoevskys
dead
house
there
is
not
a
single
work
of
artistic
prose
of
the
modern
period
of
russian
literature
rising
slightly
above
mediocrity
that
would
fit
perfectly
into
the
form
of
the
novel
the
epic
or
the
story
two
things
in
this
passage
are
especially
characteristic
of
tolstoy
first
the
negative
definition
of
the
genre
and
second
the
assertion
that
his
departure
from
artistic
convention
was
not
premeditated
both
might
be
taken
as
disingenuous
but
i
do
not
think
they
are
tolstoy
was
trying
to
express
something
which
to
his
mind
had
never
been
expressed
before
and
which
therefore
required
a
new
form
that
could
only
define
itself
as
he
worked
by
excluding
the
known
forms
of
extended
narrative
he
leaves
an
empty
place
in
which
an
as
yet
unknown
form
indefinable
and
unnameable
may
appear
he
uses
the
same
negative
method
throughout
war
and
peace
itself
but
this
procedure
was
not
premeditatedthat
is
as
pasternak
rightly
said
it
was
not
a
literary
method
not
a
play
with
form
for
its
own
sake
in
the
modernist
sense
he
found
it
necessary
for
the
task
he
had
set
himself
what
was
that
task
what
was
it
that
tolstoy
wanted
to
express
in
his
book
which
he
deliberately
does
not
call
a
novel
boris
de
schloezer
a
fine
critic
and
philosopher
wrote
in
the
preface
to
his
french
translation
of
war
and
peace
1960
that
tolstoys
one
aim
from
the
beginning
was
to
speak
the
truth
as
perceived
by
his
eye
and
his
conscience
all
the
forces
of
his
imagination
his
power
of
evocation
and
expression
converge
on
that
one
single
goal
outside
any
other
religious
or
moral
considerations
tolstoy
when
he
writes
obeys
one
imperative
which
is
the
foundation
of
what
one
might
call
his
literary
ethic
that
imperative
is
not
imposed
on
the
artist
by
the
moralist
it
is
the
voice
of
the
artist
himself
as
early
as
the
sketch
sevastopol
in
may
of
1855
tolstoy
had
asserted
my
hero
is
truth
in
war
and
peace
he
wanted
to
speak
the
truth
about
a
certain
period
of
russian
lifethe
period
of
the
napoleonic
wars
of
1805
to
1812
he
wanted
to
say
not
how
that
period
could
be
made
to
appear
in
a
beautiful
lie
an
entertaining
or
instructive
story
a
historical
narrative
but
how
it
was
he
wanted
to
capture
in
words
what
happened
the
way
it
happened
but
how
does
happening
happen
how
can
words
express
it
without
falsifying
it
how
can
one
capture
the
past
once
it
is
past
these
were
questions
that
tolstoy
constantly
brooded
on
he
had
already
posed
them
for
himself
in
1851
in
his
very
first
literary
work
the
fragment
a
history
of
yesterday
the
composition
of
war
and
peace
was
his
fullest
response
to
them
po232te
et
non
honn234te
homme
wrote
pascal
meaning
that
a
poet
cannot
be
an
honest
man
tolstoy
fully
agreed
with
pascal
he
tried
all
his
life
to
be
honn234te
homme
et
non
po232te
nabokov
in
his
lecture
notes
on
anna
karenina
speaks
of
tolstoys
style
with
its
readiness
to
admit
any
robust
awkwardness
if
that
is
the
shortest
way
to
sense
yet
tolstoy
found
that
the
truth
could
not
be
approached
directly
that
every
attempt
at
direct
expression
became
a
simplification
and
therefore
a
lie
and
that
the
shortest
way
to
sense
was
rather
long
and
indirect
he
was
acutely
aware
of
the
inadequacy
of
all
human
means
of
speaking
the
truth
but
his
artistic
intuition
told
him
that
those
means
might
be
composed
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
the
truth
to
appear
against
his
will
he
found
that
to
be
an
honest
man
he
had
to
be
a
poet
in
the
fifth
section
of
a
few
words
tolstoy
freely
embraces
that
role
discussing
the
differences
between
the
historian
and
the
artist
a
historian
and
an
artist
describing
a
historical
epoch
have
two
completely
different
objectsfor
a
historian
considering
the
contribution
rendered
by
some
person
towards
a
certain
goal
there
are
heroes
for
the
artist
considering
the
correspondence
of
this
person
to
all
sides
of
life
there
cannot
and
should
not
be
any
heroes
but
there
should
be
people
and
further
on
a
historian
has
to
do
with
the
results
of
an
event
the
artist
with
the
fact
of
the
event
and
again
the
difference
between
the
results
obtained
is
explained
by
the
sources
from
which
the
two
draw
their
information
for
the
historian
we
continue
the
example
of
a
battle
the
main
source
is
the
reports
of
individual
commanders
and
the
commander
in
chief
the
artist
can
draw
nothing
from
such
sources
they
tell
him
nothing
explain
nothing
moreover
the
artist
turns
away
from
them
finding
in
them
a
necessary
falsehood
neither
here
nor
elsewhere
however
does
tolstoy
say
what
sources
the
artist
does
draw
from
to
compound
the
problem
he
says
at
the
end
of
the
same
section
but
the
artist
should
not
forget
that
the
notion
of
historical
figures
and
events
formed
among
people
is
based
not
on
fantasy
but
on
historical
documents
insofar
as
historians
have
been
able
to
amass
them
and
therefore
while
understanding
and
presenting
these
figures
and
events
differently
the
artist
ought
to
be
guided
like
the
historian
by
historical
materials
the
difference
lies
not
in
the
figures
and
events
that
are
seen
but
in
the
way
of
seeing
them
the
artist
sees
not
heroes
but
people
not
results
but
facts
and
considers
a
person
not
in
terms
of
a
goal
but
in
correspondence
to
all
sides
of
lifewith
what
pasternak
calls
the
passion
of
creative
contemplation
which
tolstoy
wisely
avoids
defining
this
leads
to
a
crucial
if
paradoxical
reversal
the
most
real
and
even
in
tolstoys
sense
historical
figures
in
war
and
peace
turn
out
to
be
the
fictional
ones
and
the
most
unreal
the
most
insubstantial
and
futile
the
historical
ones
tolstoy
undermines
the
idea
of
significant
action
though
it
was
the
foundation
of
virtually
all
narrative
before
him
he
does
not
say
that
all
action
is
insignificant
but
that
the
only
significant
actions
are
the
insignificant
ones
whose
meaning
lies
elsewhere
not
in
the
public
space
but
in
absolute
solitude
for
prince
andrei
there
is
something
in
the
infinite
sky
above
him
but
it
is
not
a
general
idea
and
he
is
unable
to
communicate
it
to
anyone
else
in

only
when
he
is

they
are
the
revelation
made
by
solitude
in
the
thick
of

action
tolstoy
grants
this
intimate
but
immense
reality
to
each
of
his
major
characters
and
to
many
of
the
minor
ones
who
then
cease
to
be
minor
yet
there
is
nothing
very
remarkable
about
these
characters
turgenev

that
they
were

a
sense

tolstoy
was
aware
of
that
it
was
what
he
intended

there
a
few
words
about
translation
and
this
translation
it
is
often
said
that
a
good
translation
is
one
that
does
not
feel
like
a
translation
one
that
reads
smoothly
in
idiomatic
english
but
who
determines
the
standard
of
the
idiomatic
and
why
should
it
be
applied
to
something
so
idiolectic
as
a
great
work
of
literature
is
melville
idiomatic
is
faulkner
is
beckett
those
who
raise
the
question
of
the
idiomatic
in
translation
do
not
seem
to
realize
that
they
are
imposing
their
own
often
very
narrow
limits
on
the
original
a
translator
who
turns
a
great
original
into
a
patchwork
of
readymade
contemporary
phrases
with
no
regard
for
its
particular
tone
rhythm
or
character
and
claims
that
that
is
how
tolstoy
would
have
written
today
in
english
betrays
both
english
and
tolstoy
translation
is
not
the
transfer
of
a
detachable
meaning
from
one
language
to
another
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
literature
there
is
no
meaning
detachable
from
the
words
that
express
it
translation
is
a
dialogue
between
two
languages
it
occurs
in
a
space
between
two
languages
and
most
often
between
two
historical
moments
much
of
the
real
value
of
translation
as
an
art
comes
from
that
unique
situation
it
is
not
exclusively
the
language
of
arrival
or
the
time
of
the
translator
and
reader
that
should
be
privileged
we
all
know
in
the
case
of
war
and
peace
that
we
are
reading
a
nineteenthcentury
russian
novel
that
fact
allows
the
twentyfirst
century
translator
a
different
range
of
possibilities
than
may
exist
for
a
twentyfirst
century
writer
it
allows
for
the
enrichment
of
the
translators
own
language
rather
than
the
imposition
of
his
language
on
the
original
to
move
from
that
fertile
ground
towards
either
extremethat
is
towards
interlinear
literalness
or
total
accommodation
to
the
new
languageis
to
lose
the
possibilities
that
exist
only
in
the
space
between
two
times
and
languages
tolstoys
prose
has
been
much
praised
and
much
criticized
he
scorned
fine
writers
calling
them
hairdressers
yet
we
know
from
the
many
drafts
he
preserved
that
he
constantly
worked
over
his
texts
revising
and
refining
them
bringing
them
closer
to
what
he
wanted
to
express
tolstoys
prose
is
an
artistic
medium
it
is
all
of
a
piece
it
is
not
good
or
bad
russian
prose
it
is
tolstoyan
prose
what
the
translator
should
seek
in
his
own
language
is
the
equivalent
of
that
specific
artistic
medium
he
must
have
the
freedom
in
his
own
language
to
be
faithful
to
the
original

cambridge

r
h
christian
says
from
the
point
of
view
of
language
and
style
tolstoy
has
been
better
served
by
his
translators
than
many
of
his
fellowcountrymen
nevertheless
standards
fall
a
long
way
short
of
perfection
clumsiness
and
simplesse
apart
no
english
version
of
war
and
peace
has
succeeded
in
conveying
the
power
balance
rhythm
and
above
all
the
repetitiveness
of
the
original
perhaps
it
is
repetition
which
is
the
most
characteristic
single
feature
of
tolstoys
prose
style
he
illustrates
his
point
with
two
passages
the
second
of
which
in
our
translation
reads
as
follows
italics
added
thought
prince
andrei
waiting
among
many
significant
and
insigificant
persons
in
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
during
his
service
mostly
as
an
adjutant
prince
andrei
had
seen
many
anterooms
of
significant
persons
and
the
differing
characters
of
these
anterooms
were
very
clear
to
him
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
had
a
completely
special
character
the
insignificant
persons
waiting
in
line
for
an
audience
in
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
without
mentioning
the
parallel
play
on
significant
and
insignificant
persons
christian
notes
that
the
russian
word
pri233mnaya
anteroom
recurs
five
times
in
as
many
lines
and
that
the
maude
translation
1927
glosses
over
that
fact
by
omitting
the
word
once
and
using
three
different
words
for
the
rest
i
will
add
that
in
ann
dunnigans
translation
1968
the
repetitions
are
treated
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
in
the
maudes
that
anthony
briggs
in
his
2005
version
omits
the
repeated
word
twice
and
varies
it
twice
while
constance
garnett
1904
omits
it
once
but
otherwise
keeps
the
repetitions
this
passage
is
a
fairly
restrained
example
of
what
i
have
called
tolstoys
signature
style
but
it
does
illustrate
how
the
balance
and
rhythm
of
his
prose
depend
on
repetition
these
qualities
are
lost
when
the
general
principle
of
avoiding
repetitions
is
mechanically
applied
to
it
tolstoy
also
had
a
fondness
for
larger
rhetorical
structures
based
on
repeated
triads
of
nouns
verbs
adjectives
and
so
on
we
have
made
it
a
point
to
keep
his
repetitions
as
well
as
other
devices
of
formal
rhetoric
for
instance
chiasmus
that
tolstoy
consciously
used
and
that
his
translators
have
often
ignored
tolstoy
once
boasted
that
in
writing
war
and
peace
he
had
used
every
rhetorical
device
of
the
old
latin
grammarians
which
means
they
are
not
there
by
chance
the
other
extreme
of
tolstoys
style
is
exemplified
by
the
short
sentence
the
shortest
in
war
and
peace
that
i
have
already
quoted
drops
dripped
it
is
the
first
sentence
of
a
paragraph
made
up
of
four
brief
staccato
sentences
four
quite
ordinary
observations
which
acquire
a
lyrical
intensity
owing
solely
to
the
sound
and
rhythm
of
the
words

it
is
a
night
scene
and
one
of
the
most
haunting
moments
in
the
book
other
english
versions
translate
the
first
sentence
as
the
branches
dripped
the
trees
were
dripping
or
closer
to
the
russian
raindrops
dripped
they
all
state
a
fact
instead
of
rendering
a
sound
which
by
a
stroke
of
translators
luck
comes
out
almost
the
same
in
english
as
in
russian
here
is
another
example
of
the
same
stylistic
compactness
this
time
expressing
a
psychological
insight
rather
than
a
sense
impression
it
describes
the
moment
when
natasha
who
has
almost
cut
herself
off
from
all
life
suddenly
has
to
take
care
of
her
griefstricken
mother
tolstoy
says
simply
prosn250las
lyub243v
i
prosn250las
zh237zn
love
awoke
and
life
awoke
all
that
tolstoy
leaves
unsaid
about
natashas
inner
life
in
these
few
words
is
implied
by
their
very
matteroffactness
expressed
in
the
exact
rhetorical
balance
of
the
phrasing
other
english
versions
read
love
was
awakened
and
life
waked
with
it
love
awoke
and
so
did
life
or
when
love
reawakened
life
reawakened
they
convey
the
same
general
meaning
but
hardly
the
same
sense
as
the
original
a
final
example
tolstoy
describes
children
playing
in
their
room
when
their
mother
comes
in
dy233ti
na
st250lyakh
y233khali

sob243yu
the
children
were
riding
to
moscow
on
chairs
and
invited
her
to
go
with
them
to
translate
the
first
phrase
as
the
children
were
sitting
on
chairs
playing
at
driving
to
moscow
or
the
children
were
playing
at
going
to
moscow
in
a
carriage
made
of
chairs
or
the
children
were
perched
on
chairs
playing
at
driving
to
moscow
as
has
been
done
is
to
miss
both
the
rhythm
and
the
point
the
charm
of
tolstoys
sentence
comes
from
the
fact
that
he
does
not
explain
in
an
adult
way
what
the
children
are
doing
he
enters
into
the
spirit
of
their
game
by
the
phrasing
he
uses
to
describe
it
and
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
moment
is
suddenly
there
na239ve
natural
and
alive
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
tolstoy
calculated
these
effects
they
are
not
effects
at
all
they
are
what
he
saw
and
felt
as
he
wanted
and
was
able
to
express
it
but
to
translate
what
he
saw
and
felt
one
must
also
translate
as
far
as
possible
the
way
it
is
expressed
these
examples
will
give
at
least
an
idea
of
how
we
have
gone
about
that
task
we
have
kept
all
the
french
and
german
as
tolstoy
had
it
as
well
as
the
mixed
voicings
the
gallicisms
germanisms
and
implied
foreign
accents
as
they
play
throughout
the
book
we
have
tried
to
be
true
to
tolstoys
rhetorical
power

sharp

his
astonishing
delicacy

sit

and
tell
me
about
it
so
spoke
in
july
1805
the
renowned
anna
pavlovna
scherer
maid
of
honor
and
intimate
of
the
empress
maria
feodorovna
greeting
the
important
and
highranking
prince
vassily
the
first
to
arrive
at
her
soir233e
anna
pavlovna
had
been
coughing
for
several
days
she
had
the
grippe
as
she
put
it
grippe
was
a
new
word
then
used
only
by
rare
people
little
notes
had
been
sent
out
that
morning
with
a
redliveried
footman
and
on
all
of
them
without
distinction
there
was
written
si
vous
navez

monsieur
le
comte
or
mon

et
si
la
perspective

vous

entre

et
10
heures
annette
scherer
dieu
quelle
virulente
sortie
the
entering
prince
replied
not
ruffled
in
the
least
by
such
a
reception
he
was
wearing
an
embroidered
court
uniform
stockings
shoes
and
stars
and
had
a
bright
expression
on
his
flat
face
he
spoke
that
refined
french
in
which
our
grandparents
not
only
spoke
but
thought
and
with
those
quiet
patronizing
intonations
which
are
proper
to
a
significant
man
who
has
grown
old
in
society
and
at
court
he
went
over
to
anna
pavlovna
kissed
her
hand
presenting
her
with
his
perfumed
and
shining
bald
pate
and
settled
comfortably
on
the
sofa
avant
tout
ditesmoi
comment
vous
allez
ch232re
amie
set
me
at
ease
he
said
without
changing
his
voice
and
in
a
tone
in
which
through
propriety
and
sympathy
one
could
discern
indifference
and
even
mockery
how
can
one
be
wellwhen
one
suffers
morally
is
it
possible
to
remain
at
ease
in
our
time
if
one
has
any
feeling
said
anna
pavlovna
youll
stay
the
whole
evening
i
hope
and
the
f234te
at
the
british
ambassadors
today
is
wednesday
i
must
put
in
an
appearance
said
the
prince
my
daughter
will
come
to
fetch
me
and
take
me
there
i
thought
todays
f234te
was
cancelled
je
vous
avoue

et

insipides
if
they
had
known
that
you
wished
it
the
f234te
would
have
been
cancelled
said
the
prince
uttering
out
of
habit
like
a
woundup
clock
things
that
he
did
not
even
wish
people
to
believe

prince
vassily
always
spoke
lazily
the
way
an
actor
speaks
a
role
in
an
old
play
anna
pavlovna
scherer
on
the
contrary
despite
her
forty
years
was
brimming
with
animation
and
impulses
being
an
enthusiast
had
become
her
social
position
and
she
sometimes
became
enthusiastic
even
when
she
had
no
wish
to
so
as
not
to
deceive
the
expectations
of
people
who
knew
her
the
restrained
smile
that
constantly
played
on
anna
pavlovnas
face
though
it
did
not
suit
her
outworn
features
expressed
as
it
does
in
spoiled
children
a
constant
awareness
of
her
dear
shortcoming
which
she
did
not
wish
could
not
and
found
no
need
to
correct
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
about
political
doings
anna
pavlovna
waxed
vehement
ah
dont
speak
to
me
of
austria
maybe
i
dont
understand
anything
but
austria
does
not
want
and
has
never
wanted
war
shes
betraying
us
russia
alone
must
be
the
savior
of
europe
our
benefactor
knows
his
lofty
calling
and
will
be
faithful
to
it
that
is
the
one
thing
i
trust
in
our
kind
and
wonderful
sovereign
is
faced
with
the
greatest
role
in
the
world
and
he
is
so
virtuous
and
good
that
god
will
not
abandon
him
and
he
will
fulfill
his
calling
to
crush
the
hydra
of
revolution
which
has
now
become
still
more
terrible
in
the
person
of
this
murderer
and
villain
we
alone
must
redeem
the
blood
of
the
righteous
one
in
whom
can
we
trust
i
ask
youengland
with
her
commercial
spirit
will
not
and
cannot
understand
all
the
loftiness
of
the
emperor
alexanders
soul
she
refused
to
evacuate
malta
she
wants
to
see
she
searches
for
ulterior
motives
in
our
acts
what
did
they
say
to
novosiltsov
nothing
they
did
not
they
could
not
understand
the
selfdenial
of
our
emperor
who
wants
nothing
for
himself
and
everything
for
the
good
of
the
world
and
what
have
they
promised
nothing
and
what
they
did
promise
will
not
be
done
prussia
has
already
declared
that
bonaparte
is
invincible
and
that
all
europe
can
do
nothing
against
himand
i
dont
believe
a
single
word

i
trust
only
in
god
and
in
the
lofty
destiny
of
our
dear
emperor
he
will
save
europe
she
suddenly
stopped
with
a
mocking
smile
at
her
own
vehemence
i
think
the
prince
said
smiling
that
if
they
sent
you
instead
of
our
dear
wintzingerode
you
would
take
the
prussian
kings
consent
by
storm
youre
so
eloquent

you
give

she
added
calming
down
again
ill

do
you

ah
ill
be
very
glad
said
the
prince
tell
me
he
added
as
if
just
recalling
something
and
with
special
casualness
though
what
he
asked
about
was
the
main
purpose
of
his
visit
is
it
true
that
limp233ratricem232re

prince
vassily
wanted
his
son
to
be
appointed
to
this
post
which
through
the
empress
maria
feodorovna
had
been
solicited
for
the
baron
anna
pavlovna
all
but
closed
her
eyes
as
a
sign
that
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
could
judge
of
the
empresss
good
pleasure
or
liking

224
limp233ratricem232re
par
sa

she
merely
said
in
a
sad
dry
tone
the
moment
anna
pavlovna
mentioned
the
empress
her
face
suddenly
presented
a
profound
and
sincere
expression
of
devotion
and
respect
combined
with
sadness
which
happened
each
time
she
referred
to
her
exalted
patroness
in
conversation
she
said
that
her
majesty
had
deigned
to
show
baron
funke
beaucoup
destime
and
her
eyes
again
clouded
over
with
sadness
the
prince
lapsed
into
indifferent
silence
anna
pavlovna
with
her
courtly
and
feminine
adroitness
and
ready
tact
wanted
both
to
swat
the
prince
for
daring
to
make
such
a
pronouncement
about
a
person
recommended
to
the
empress
and
at
the
same
time
to
comfort
him
mais
224
propos
de
votre

she
said
do
you
know
that
your
daughter
since
her
coming
out
fait
les
d233lices
de
tout
le
monde
on
la
trouve
belle
comme
le
jour
the
prince
bowed
in
a
sign
of
respect
and
gratitude
i
often
think
anna
pavlovna
went
on
after
a
moments
silence
moving
closer
to
the
prince
and
smiling
tenderly
at
him
as
if
to
show
thereby
that
the
political
and
social
conversations
were
at
an
end
and
a
hearttoheart
one
was
beginning
i
often
think
how
unfairly
lifes
good
fortune
is
sometimes
distributed
why
has
fate
given
you
two
such
nice
children
excluding
anatole
your
youngest
i
dont
like
him
she
put
in
peremptorily
raising
her
eyebrows
such
lovely
children
and
you
really
value
them
less
than
anyone
and
are
therefore
unworthy
of
them
and
she
smiled
her
rapturous
smile
que
voulezvous
lavater
aurait
dit
que
je
nai
pas
la
bosse
de
la
paternit233
said
the
prince
stop
joking
i
wanted
to
talk
seriously
with
you
you
know
im
displeased
with
your
younger
son
just
between
us
her
face
acquired
a
sad
look
there
was
talk
about
him
at
her
majestys
and
you
were
pitied
the
prince
did
not
reply
but
she
fell
silent
looking
at
him
significantly
waiting
for
a
reply
prince
vassily
winced
what
am
i
to
do
he
said
finally
you
know
i
did
all
a
father
could
for
their
upbringing
and
they
both
turned
out
des
imb233ciles
ippolit
is
at
least
an
untroublesome
fool
but
anatole
is
a
troublesome
one
thats
the
only
difference
he
said
smiling
more
unnaturally
and
animatedly
than
usual
and
with
that
showing
especially
clearly
in
the
wrinkles
that
formed
around
his
mouth
something
unexpectedly
coarse
and
disagreeable
ah
why
do
such
people
as
you
have
children
if
you
werent
a
father
id
have
nothing
to
reproach
you
for
said
anna
pavlovna
raising
her
eyes
pensively

it
that
way
to

que

he
paused
expressing
with
a
gesture
his
submission
to
cruel
fate
anna
pavlovna
fell
to
thinking
have
you
never
thought
of
getting
your
prodigal
son
anatole
married
they
say
she
observed
that

bolkonsky

vassily
did
not
reply
though
with
the
quickness
of
grasp
and
memory
characteristic
of
society
people
he
showed
by
a
nod
of
the
head
that
he
had
taken
this
information
into
account
no

anatole

he
said
obviously
unable
to
restrain
the
melancholy
course
of
his
thoughts
he
paused
how

be

years

waved

sprawled

had
come

ritual
of
greeting
the
totally
unknown
totally
uninteresting
and
unnecessary
aunt
with
sad
solemn
sympathy
anna
pavlovna
followed
their
greetings
silently
approving
of
them
to
each
of
them
ma
tante
spoke
in
the
same
expressions
about
his
health
her
own
health
and
the
health
of
her
majesty
which
thank
god
was
better
that
day
all
those
who
went
up
to
her
showing
no
haste
for
proprietys
sake
left
the
little
old
lady
with
a
feeling
of
relief
after
the
fulfillment
of
a
heavy
obligation
never
to
approach
her
again
all
evening
the
young
princess
bolkonsky
came
with
handwork
in
a
goldembroidered
velvet
bag
her
pretty
upper
lip
with
its
barely
visible
black
mustache
was
too
short
for
her
teeth
but
the
more
sweetly
did
it
open
and
still
more
sweetly
did
it
sometimes
stretch
and
close
on
the
lower
one
as
happens
with
perfectly
attractive
women
her
flawa
short
lip
and
halfopened
mouthseemed
her
special
personal
beauty
everyone
felt
cheerful
looking
at
this
pretty
future
mother
full
of
health
and
liveliness
who
bore
her
condition
so
easily
to
old
men
and
to
bored
morose
young
ones
it
seemed
that
they
themselves
came
to
resemble
her
having
been
with
her
and
spoken
with
her
for
a
time
anyone
who
talked
with
her
and
saw
her
bright
little
smile
at
every
word
and
her
gleaming
white
teeth
which
showed
constantly
thought
himself
especially
amiable
that
day
and
that
is
what
each
of
them
thought
the
little
princess
waddling
went
around
the
table
with
small
quick
steps
her
bag
of
handwork
hanging
on
her
arm
and
cheerfully
straightening
her
dress
sat
down
on
the
sofa
near
the
silver
samovar
looking
as
though
everything
she
did
was
a
partie
de
plaisir
for
her
and
for
everyone
around
her
jai

she
said
unclasping
her
reticule
and
addressing
them
all
together
look
annette
ne

she
turned
to
the
hostess
vouz

que

toute
petite
soir233e
voyez
comme
je
suis

and
she
spread
her
arms
to
show
her
elegant
gray
lacetrimmed
dress
tied
slightly
below
the
breasts
with
a
broad
ribbon
soyez
tranquille

vous
serez
toujours
la
plus
jolie
anna
pavlovna
replied
vous
savez
mon
mari
mabandonne
she
went
on
in
the
same
tone
turning
to
a
general
il
va
se
faire
tuer
dites
moi
pourquoi
cette
vilaine
guerre
she
said
to
prince
vassily
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
turned
to
prince
vassilys
daughter
the
beautiful
h233l232ne
quelle
d233licieuse
personne
que
cette
petite
princesse
prince
vassily
said
to
anna
pavlovna
soon
after
the
little
princess
came
a
massive
fat
young
man
with
a
cropped
head
in
spectacles
lightcolored
trousers
of
the
latest
fashion
a
high
jabot
and
a
brown
tailcoat
this
fat
young
man
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
famous
courtier
from
catherines
time
count
bezukhov
who
was
now
dying
in
moscow
he
did
not
serve
anywhere
yet
he
had
only
just
arrived
from
abroad
where
he
had
been
educated
and
this
was
his
first
time
in
society
anna
pavlovna
greeted
him
with
a
nod
reserved
for
people
of
the
lowest
hierarchy
in
her
salon
but
despite
this
greeting
of
the
lowest
sort
at
the
sight
of
the
entering
pierre
uneasiness
and
fear
showed
in
anna
pavlovnas
face
like
that
expressed
at
the
sight
of
something
all
too
enormous
and
unsuited
to
the
place
though
pierre
was
indeed
somewhat
larger
than
the
other
men
in
the
room
this
fear
could
have
referred
only
to
the
intelligent
and
at
the
same
time
shy
observant
and
natural
gaze
which
distinguished
him
from
everyone
else
in
that
drawing
room
cest
bien
aimable
224
vous
monsieur
pierre
d234tre
venu
voir
une
pauvre
malade
anna
pavlovna
said
to
him
exchanging
fearful
looks
with
the
aunt
to
whom
she
was
bringing
him
pierre
burbled
something
incomprehensible
and
went
on
searching
for
something
with
his
eyes
he
smiled
joyfully
merrily
bowed
to
the
little
princess
as
to
a
close
acquaintance
and
went
up
to
the
aunt
anna
pavlovnas
fear
was
not
in
vain
because
pierre
without
hearing
out
the
aunts
talk
about
her
majestys
health
walked
away
from
her
the
frightened
anna
pavlovna
stopped
him
with
the
words
you
dont
know
the
abb233
morio
hes
a
very
interesting
man
she
said
yes
ive
heard
about
his
plan
for
eternal
peace
and
its
very
interesting
but
hardly
possible
you
think
so
said
anna
pavlovna
in
order
to
say
something
and
again
turned
to
her
duties
as
mistress
of
the
house
but
pierre
committed
the
reverse
discourtesy
earlier
he
had
walked
away
without
hearing
out
a
lady
who
was
talking
to
him
now
he
held
with
his
conversation
a
lady
who
needed
to
leave
him
lowering
his
head
and
spreading
his
big
feet
he
began
to
explain
to
anna
pavlovna
why
he
thought
that
the
abb233s
plan
was
a
chimera
well
talk
later
anna
pavlovna
said
smiling
and
ridding
herself
of
the
young
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
live
she
returned
to
her
duties
as
mistress
of
the
house
and
went
on
listening
and
looking
out
ready
to
come
to
the
rescue
at
any
point
where
the
conversation
lagged
as
the
owner
of
a
spinning
mill
having
put
his
workers
in
their
places
strolls
about
the
establishment
watching
out
for
an
idle
spindle
or
the
odd
one
squealing
much
too
loudly
and
hastens
to
go
and
slow
it
down
or
start
it
up
at
the
proper
speedso
anna
pavlovna
strolled
about
her
drawing
room
going
up
to
a
circle
that
had
fallen
silent
or
was
too
talkative
and
with
one
word
or
rearrangement
set
the
conversation
machine
running
evenly
and
properly
again
but
amidst
all
these
cares
there
could
still
be
seen
in
her
a
special
fear
for
pierre
she
glanced
at
him
concernedly
when
he
went
over
to
listen
to
what
was
being
talked
about
around
mortemart
and
went
on
to
another
circle
where
the
abb233
was
talking
for
pierre
brought
up
abroad
this
soir233e
of
anna
pavlovnas
was
the
first
he
had
seen
in
russia
he
knew
that
all
the
intelligentsia
of
petersburg
was
gathered
there
and
like
a
child
in
a
toy
shop
he
looked
everywhere
at
once
he
kept
fearing
to
miss
intelligent
conversations
that
he
might
have
listened
to
looking
at
the
selfassured
and
elegant
expressions
on
the
faces
gathered
here
he
kept
expecting
something
especially
intelligent
finally
he
went
up
to
morio
the
conversation
seemed
interesting
to
him
and
he
stopped
waiting
for
a
chance
to
voice
his
thoughts
as
young
people
like
to
do
iii
anna
pavlovnas
soir233e
got
going
the
spindles
on
all
sides
hummed
evenly
and
ceaselessly
besides
ma
tante
next
to
whom
sat
only
one
elderly
lady
with
a
thin
weepy
face
somewhat
alien
to
this
brilliant
company
the
company
had
broken
up
into
three
circles
in
one
mostly
masculine
the
center
was
the
abb233
in
another
of
young
people
it
was
the
beautiful
princess
h233l232ne
prince
vassilys
daughter
and
the
pretty
redcheeked
little
princess
bolkonsky
too
plump
for
her
age
in
the
third
it
was
mortemart
and
anna
pavlovna
the
viscount
was
a
nicelooking
young
man
with
soft
features
and
manners
obviously
regarded
himself
as
a
celebrity
but
from
good
breeding
modestly
allowed
himself
to
be
made
use
of
by
the
company
in
which
he
found
himself
anna
pavlovna
was
obviously
treating
her
guests
to
him
as
a
good
ma238tre
dh244tel
presents
as
something
supernaturally
excellent
a
piece
of
beef
one
would
not
want
to
eat
if
one
saw
it
in
the
dirty
kitchen
so
that
evening
anna
pavlovna
served
up
to
her
guests
first
the
viscount
then
the
abb233
as
something
supernaturally
refined
in
mortemarts
circle
the
conversation
turned
at
once
to
the
murder
of
the
duc
denghien
the
viscount
said
that
the
duc
denghien
had
perished
from
his
own
magnanimity
and
that
there
were
special
reasons
for
bonapartes
viciousness
ah
voyons
conteznous
cela
vicomte
said
anna
pavlovna
joyfully
sensing
that
something
224
la
louis
xv
echoed
in
this
phrase
conteznous
cela
vicomte
the
viscount
bowed
as
a
sign
of
submission
and
smiled
politely
anna
pavlovna
circled
around
the
viscount
and
invited
everyone
to
listen
to
his
story

a

whispered
to
one
le

she
said
to
another
comme
on
voit
lhomme
de
la
bonne
compagnie
she
said
to
a
third
and
the
viscount
was
presented
to
the
company
in
a
most
refined
and
advantageous
light
like
a
roast
beef
on
a
hot
platter
sprinkled
with
herbs
the
viscount
was
just
about
to
begin
his
story
and
smiled
subtly
come
over
here
ch232re
h233l232ne
anna
pavlovna
said
to
the
beautiful
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
off
forming
the
center
of
another
circle
princess
h233l232ne
was
smiling
she
got
up
with
the
same
unchanging
smile
of
a
perfectly
beautiful
woman
with
which
she
had
entered
the
drawing
room
lightly
rustling
her
white
ball
gown
trimmed
with
ivy
and
moss
her
white
shoulders
gleaming
her
hair
and
diamonds
shining
she
walked
straight
on
between
the
parted
men
not
looking
at
anyone
but
smiling
to
everyone
and
as
if
kindly
granting
each
of
them
the
right
to
admire
the
beauty
of
her
figure
her
full
shoulders
her
very
exposed
bosom
and
back
as
the
fashion
then
was
and
as
if
bringing
with
her
the
brilliance
of
a
ball
approached
anna
pavlovna
h233l232ne
was
so
goodlooking
that
there
was
not
only
not
a
trace
of
coquetry
to
be
seen
in
her
but
on
the
contrary
it
was
as
if
she
was
embarrassed
by
her
unquestionable
and
all
too
strongly
and
triumphantly
effective
beauty
it
was
as
if
she
wished
but
was
unable
to
diminish
the
effect
of
her
beauty
quelle
belle
personne
said
everyone
who
saw
her
as
if
struck
by
something
extraordinary
the
viscount
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lowered
his
eyes
while
she
was
seating
herself
before
him
and
shining
upon
him
that
same
unchanging
smile
madame
je
crains
pour
mes
moyens
devant
un
pareil
auditoire
he
said
inclining
his
head
with
a
smile
the
princess
rested
the
elbow
of
her
bare
rounded
arm
on
a
little
table
and
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
say
anything
she
waited
smiling
throughout
the
story
she
sat
erect
glancing
occasionally
now
at
her
rounded
beautiful
arm
lying
lightly
on
the
table
now
at
the
still
more
beautiful
bosom
on
which
she
straightened
a
diamond
necklace
she
also
straightened
the
folds
of
her
gown
several
times
and
when
the
story
produced
an
impression
turned
to
look
at
anna
pavlovna
and
at
once
assumed
the
same
expression
as
on
the
maid
of
honors
face
and
then
settled
back
into
a
radiant
smile
after
h233l232ne
the
little
princess
also
came
over
from
the
tea
table
attendezmoi
je
vais
prendre
mon
ouvrage
she
said
voyons
224
quoi
pensezvous
she
turned
to
prince
ippolit
apportezmoi
mon
reticule
the
princess
smiling
and
talking
with
everyone
suddenly
effected
the
transposition
and
taking
a
seat
cheerily
settled
herself
now
i
feel
good
she
said
several
times
and
asking
them
to
begin
started
to
work
prince
ippolit
fetched
her
reticule
came
after
her
and
moving
his
chair
towards
her
sat
down
close
by
le
charmant
hippolyte
was
striking
in
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
his
beautiful
sister
and
still
more
in
being
strikingly
unattractive
despite
that
resemblance
the
features
of
his
face
were
the
same
as
his
sisters
but
in
her
everything
was
lit
up
by
her
joyous
selfcontented
young
unchanging
smile
and
the
extraordinary
classical
beauty
of
her
body
in
her
brother
on
the
contrary
the
same
face
was
clouded
by
idiocy
and
invariably
expressed
a
selfassured
peevishness
and
his
body
was
skinny
and
weak
his
eyes
nose
and
mouth
all
seemed
to
shrink
into
an
indefinite
and
dull
grimace
and
his
arms
and
legs
always
assumed
an
unnatural
position
ce
nest
pas
une
histoire
des
revenants
he
said
sitting
down
near
the
princess
and
hastily
affixing
a
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
as
if
he
was
unable
to
start
talking
without
this
instrument
mais
non
mon
cher
the
surprised
storyteller
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
cest
que
je
d233teste
les
histoires
des
revenants
said
prince
ippolit
in
such
a
tone
that
it
was
clear
he
had
said
these
words
and
only
then
understood
what
they
meant
because
of
the
selfassurance
with
which
he
spoke
no
one
could
make
out
whether
what
he
had
said
was
very
clever
or
very
stupid
he
was
wearing
a
dark
green
tailcoat
trousers
the
color
of
cuisse
de
nymphe
effray233e
as
he
said
himself
stockings
and
shoes
the
vicomte
told
very
nicely
the
then
current
anecdote
that
the
duc
denghien
had
secretly
gone
to
paris
to
meet
with
mlle
george
and
that
there
he
had
met
bonaparte
who
also
enjoyed
the
famous
actresss
favors
and
that
there
having
met
the
duke
napoleon
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
those
faints
he
was
prone
to
and
found
himself
in
the
dukes
power
which
the
duke
did
not
take
advantage
of
and
that
bonaparte
afterwards
revenged
himself
for
this
magnanimity
with
the
dukes
death
the
story
was
very
nice
and
interesting
especially
the
moment
when
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
each
other
and
the
ladies
it
seemed
were
stirred
charmant
said
anna
pavlovna
looking
questioningly
at
the
little
princess
charmant
whispered
the
little
princess
sticking
the
needle
into
her
work
as
if
to
signify
that
the
interest
and
charm
of
the
story
kept
her
from
going
on
working
the
viscount
appreciated
this
silent
praise
and
smiling
gratefully
began
to
go
on
but
at
that
moment
anna
pavlovna
who
kept
glancing
at
the
young
man
she
found
so
frightening
noticed
that
his
conversation
with
the
abb233
was
much
too
loud
and
vehement
and
she
rushed
to
the
rescue
at
the
place
of
danger
indeed
pierre
had
managed
to
strike
up
a
conversation
with
the
abb233
about
political
balance
and
the
abb233
obviously
intrigued
by
the
young
mans
simplehearted
vehemence
was
developing
his
favorite
idea
before
him
the
two
men
listened
and
talked
too
animatedly
and
naturally
and
it
was
this
that
anna
pavlovna
did
not
like
the
means
are
european
balance
and
the
droit
des
gens
the
abb233
was
saying
let
a
powerful
state
like
russia
famous
for
its
barbarism
stand
disinterestedly
at
the
head
of
a
union
having
as
its
purpose
the
balance
of
europeand
it
will
save
the
world
how
are
you
going
to
find
such
balance
pierre
began
but
just
then
anna
pavlovna
came
over
and
with
a
stern
glance
at
pierre
asked
the
italian
how
he
was
taking
the
local
climate
the
italians
face
suddenly
changed
and
acquired
an
insultingly
false
sweetness
of
expression
which
was
probably
habitual
with
him
in
conversations
with
women
im
so
enchanted
with
the
charms
of
the
intelligence
and
cultivation
of
society
especially
the
womens
where
i
have
had
the
happiness
to
be
received
that
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
think
about
the
climate
he
said
not
letting
go
of
the
abb233
and
pierre
anna
pavlovna
the
better
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
joined
them
to
the
general
circle
just
then
a
new
person
entered
the
drawing
room
this
new
person
was
the
young
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
the
little
princesss
husband
prince
bolkonsky
was
of
medium
height
a
rather
handsome
young
man
with
welldefined
and
dry
features
everything
in
his
figure
from
his
weary
bored
gaze
to
his
quiet
measured
gait
presented
the
sharpest
contrast
with
his
small
lively
wife
obviously
he
not
only
knew
everyone
in
the
drawing
room
but
was
also
so
sick
of
them
that
it
was
very
boring
for
him
to
look
at
them
and
listen
to
them
of
all
the
faces
he
found
so
boring
the
face
of
his
pretty
wife
seemed
to
be
the
one
he
was
most
sick
of
with
a
grimace
that
spoiled
his
handsome
face
he
turned
away
from
her
he
kissed
anna
pavlovnas
hand
and
narrowing
his
eyes
looked
around
at
the
whole

his

addressing
her

in
the

coquettish
tone
in
which
she
addressed
others
what
a

the

told

about

closed
his

and
turned
away
pierre
who
had
not
taken
his
joyful
friendly
eyes
off
prince
andrei
since
he
entered
the
drawing
room
went
up
to
him
and
took
his
arm
prince
andrei
without
turning
around
wrinkled
his
face
into
a
grimace
expressing
vexation
at
whoever
had
taken
his

but
seeing
pierres
smiling
face
suddenly
smiled
an
unexpectedly
kind
and
pleasant
smile
well

you

in

he
said
to
pierre
i
knew
youd
be
here
pierre
replied
ill
come
to
you
for
supper
he
added
softly
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
viscount
who
was
going
on
with
his
story
may
i
no
you
may
not
prince
andrei
said
laughing
letting
pierre
know
by
the
pressure
of
his
hand
that
there
was
no
need
to
ask
he
was
about
to
say
more
but
just
then
prince
vassily
and
his
daughter
rose
and
the
men
stood
up
to
let
them
pass
you
will
excuse
me
my
dear
viscount
prince
vassily
said
to
the
frenchman
gently
pulling
him
down
on
his
chair
by
the
sleeve
so
that
he
would
not
stand
up
this
unfortunate
f234te
at
the
ambassadors
deprives
me
of
my
pleasure
and
interrupts
you
im
very
sorry
to
leave
your
delightful
soir233e
he
said
to
anna
pavlovna
his
daughter
princess
h233l232ne
lightly
holding
the
folds
of
her
gown
walked
between
the
chairs
and
the
smile
shone
still
more
brightly
on
her
beautiful
face
pierre
looked
with
enraptured
almost
frightened
eyes
at
this
beauty
as
she
walked
past
him
very
goodlooking
said
prince
andrei
very
said
pierre
passing
by
prince
vassily
seized
pierre
by
the
hand
and
turned
to
anna
pavlovna
educate
this
bear
for
me
he
said
hes
been
living
with
me
for
a
month
and
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
him
in
society
nothing
is
so
necessary
for
a
young
man
as
the
company
of
intelligent
women
iv
anna
pavlovna
smiled
and
promised
to
occupy
herself
with
pierre
who
she
knew
was
related
to
prince
vassily
through
his
father
the
elderly
lady
who
had
so
far
been
sitting
with
ma
tante
hastily
got
up
and
overtook
prince
vassily
in
the
front
hall
all
the
former
sham
interest
disappeared
from
her
face
her
kind
weepy
face
expressed
only
anxiety
and
fear
what
can
you
tell
me
prince
about
my
boris
she
said
overtaking
him
in
the
front
hall
she
pronounced
the
name
boris
with
a
special
emphasis
on
the
o
i
cannot
remain
in
petersburg
any
longer
tell
me
what
news
can
i
bring
my
poor
boy
though
prince
vassily
listened
to
the
elderly
lady
reluctantly
and
almost
impolitely
and
even
showed
impatience
she
smiled
at
him
gently
and
touchingly
and
even
took
him
by
the
arm
to
keep
him
from
walking
away
it
wont
cost
you
anything
to
say
a
word
to
the
sovereign
and
hell
be
transferred
straight
away
to
the
guards
she
pleaded
believe
me
princess
ill
do
all
i
can
replied
prince
vassily
but
its
hard
for
me
to
ask
the
sovereign
id
advise
you
to
turn
to
rumyantsev
through
prince
golitsynthat
would
be
smarter
the
elderly
lady
bore
the
name
of
princess
drubetskoy
one
of
the
best
families
of
russia
but
she
was
poor
had
long
since
left
society
and
had
lost
her
former
connections
she
had
come
now
to
solicit
an
appointment
to
the
guards
for
her
only
son
she
had
invited
herself
and
come
to
anna
pavlovnas
soir233e
only
in
order
to
see
prince
vassily
only
for
that
had
she
listened
to
the
viscounts
story
prince
vassilys
words
frightened
her
her
once
beautiful
face
showed
spite
but
that
lasted
no
more
than
a
moment
she
smiled
again
and
took
a
slightly
stronger
grip
on
prince
vassilys
arm
listen
prince
she
said
ive
never
asked
you
for
anything
and
never
will
ive
never
reminded
you
of
my
fathers
friendship
for
you
but
now
i
adjure
you
in
gods
name
do
this
for
my
son
and
i
will
consider
you
my
benefactor
she
added
hastily
no
dont
be
angry
but
promise
me
i
asked
golitsyn
and
he
refused
soyez

bon
enfant
que
vous

she
said
trying
to
smile
though
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
pap225
well
be
late
said
princess
h233l232ne
who
was
waiting
at
the
door
turning
her
beautiful
head
on
her
classical
shoulders
but
influence
in
society
is
a
capital
that
must
be
used
sparingly
lest
it
disappear
prince
vassily
knew
that
and
having
once
realized
that
if
he
were
to
solicit
for
everyone
who
solicited
from
him
it
would
soon
become
impossible
for
him
to
solicit
for
himself
he
rarely
used
his
influence
in
princess
drubetskoys
case
however
after
her
new
appeal
he
felt
something
like
a
pang
of
conscience
she
had
reminded
him
of
the
truth
he
owed
his
first
steps
in
the
service
to
her
father
besides
he
could
see
from
the
way
she
behaved
that
she
was
one
of
those
women
especially
mothers
who
once
they
take
something
into
their
heads
will
not
leave
off
until
their
desire
is
fulfilled
and
are
otherwise
prepared
to
pester
you
every
day
and
every
minute
and
even
to
make
scenes
this
last
consideration
gave
him
pause
ch232re
anna
mikhailovna
he
said
with
his
usual
tone
of
familiarity
and
boredom
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
do
what
you
want
but
to
prove
to
you
how
much
i
love
you
and
honor
the
memory
of
your
late
father
i
will
do
the
impossible
your

be
transferred
to
the
guards
here
is
my
hand
on
it
are
you
satisfied
my
dear
you
are
our
benefactor
i
expected
nothing
else
from
you
i
knew
how
kind
you
are
he
was
about
to
leave

then
ill

and
prince

smiled
that
i
will
not
promise
you
you
know
how
besieged
kutuzov
has
been
since
he
was
appointed
commander
in

he
told

himself
that
all
the

are
conspiring

in

tone

basile
anna
mikhailovna
said
behind
him
with
the
smile
of
a
young
coquette
which
must
have
suited
her
very
well
once
but
now
did
not
go
with
her
emaciated
face
she
evidently
forgot
her
age
and
employed
out
of
habit
all
her
old
feminine
resources
but
as
soon
as
he
left
her
face
again
acquired
the
same
cold
sham
expression
it
had
had
before
she
went
back
to
the
circle
where
the
viscount
was
going
on
with
his
story
and
again
pretended
to
listen
waiting
for
the
moment
to
leave
since
her
business
was
done
but
how
do
you
find
all

and
with
a
contemptuous
sigh
he
again
changed
position
at
these
words
prince
ippolit
who
had
long
been
gazing
at
the
viscount
through
his
lorgnette
suddenly
turned
his
whole
body
to
the
little
princess
and
asking
her
for
a
needle
began
showing
her
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
cond233s
drawing
with
the
needle
on
the
table
he
explained
this
coat
of
arms
to
her
with
a
significant
air
as
if
the
princess
had
asked
him
about
it
baton

cond233
he
said
the
princess
listened
smiling
if
bonaparte
remains
on
the
throne
of
france
for
another
year
the
viscount
continued
the
new
conversation
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
does
not
listen
to
others
but
in
matters
known
better
to
him
than
to
anyone
else
follows
only
the
train
of
his
own
thoughts
things
will
go
too
far
intrigues
coercion
banishments
executions
will
forever
destroy
french
societyi
mean
good
societyand
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
his
arms
pierre
was
about
to
say
something
the
conversation
interested
him
but
anna
pavlovna
who
was
keeping
watch
on
him
interrupted
the
emperor
alexander
she
said
with
the
sadness
that
always
accompanied
her
talk
about
the
imperial
family
declared
that
he
would
leave
it
to
the
french
themselves
to
choose
their
form
of
government
and
i
think
theres
no
doubt
that
the
whole
nation
freed
of
the
usurper
will
throw
itself
into
the
arms
of
the
lawful
king
anna
pavlovna
said
trying
to
be
amiable
to
the
233migr233
and
royalist
thats

said
prince
andrei
monsieur
le
vicomte
quite
rightly
supposes
that
things
have
already
gone
too
far
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
return
to
the
old
ways
from
what
ive
heard
pierre
blushing
again
mixed
into
the
conversation
almost
all
the
nobility
have
already
gone
over
to
bonapartes
side
its
the
bonapartists
who
say
that
said
the
viscount
not
looking
at
pierre
right
now
its
hard
to
know
public
opinion
in
france
bonaparte
la
dit
prince
andrei
said
with
a
grin
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
viscount
and
that
though
he
was
not
looking
at
him
his
talk
was
directed
against
him
je
leur
ai
montr233
le
chemin
de
la
gloire
he
said
after
a
short
silence
again
repeating
the
words
of
napoleon
ils
nen
ont
pas
voulu
je
leur
ai
ouvert
mes
antichambres
ils
se
sont
pr233cipit233s
en

je
ne
sais
pas
224
quel
point
il
a
eu
le
droit
de
le
dire

the
viscount
retorted
after
the
dukes
murder
even
the
most
partial
people
ceased
to
see
a
hero
in
him
si
m234me
231a

the
viscount
said
turning
to

du
duc
il
y
a
un
martyr
de
plus
dans
le
ciel
un
h233ros
de

sur
la
terre
before
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
had
time
to
smile
appreciatively
at
these
words
of
the
viscounts
pierre
again
burst
into
the
conversation
and
anna
pavlovna
though
she
anticipated
that
he
would
say
something
improper
could
no
longer
stop
him
the
execution
of
the
duc
denghien
said
pierre
was
a
necessity
of
state
and
i
precisely
see
greatness
of
soul
in
the
fact
that
napoleon
was
not
afraid
to
take
upon
himself
alone
the
responsibility
for
this
act
dieu
mon
dieu
anna
pavlovna
whispered
in
a
frightened
whisper
comment
monsieur
pierre
vous
trouvez
que
lassassinat
est
grandeur
d226me
said
the
little
princess
smiling
and
drawing
her
work
towards
her
ah
oh
said
various
voices
capital
prince
ippolit
said
in
english
and
began
slapping
his
knee
with
his
palm
the
viscount
merely
shrugged
pierre
gazed
triumphantly
at
his
listeners
over
his
spectacles
i
say
that
he
went
on
desperately
because
the
bourbons
fled
from
the
revolution
abandoning
the
people
to
anarchy
and
napoleon
alone
was
able
to
understand
the
revolution
to
defeat
it
and
therefore
for
the
sake
of
the
common
good
he
could
not
stop
short
at
the
life
of
a
single
man
wouldnt
you
like
to
move
to
that
table
asked
anna
pavlovna
but
pierre
not
answering
went
on
with
his
speech
no
he
said
growing
more
and
more
inspired
napoleon
is
great
because
he
stood
above
the
revolution
put
an
end
to
its
abuses
and
kept
all
that
was
goodthe
equality
of
citizens
and
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
pressand
that
is
the
only
reason
why
he
gained
power
yes
if
he
had
taken
that
power
and
without
using
it
for
murder
given
it
to
the
lawful
king
said
the
viscount
then
i
would
call
him
a
great
man
he
couldnt
do
that
the
people
gave
him
power
only
so
that
he
could
deliver
them
from
the
bourbons
and
because
the
people
saw
a
great
man
in
him
the
revolution
was
a
great
thing
msieur
pierre
went
on
showing
by
this
desperate
and
provocative
parenthetical
phrase
his
great
youth
and
desire
to
speak
everything
out
all
the
sooner
revolution
and
regicide
a
great
thingafter
thatwouldnt
you
like
to
move
to
that
table
anna
pavlovna
repeated
contrat
social
the
viscount
said
with
a
meek
smile
im
not
talking
about
regicide
im
talking
about
ideas
yes
the
ideas
of
pillage
murder
and
regicide
an
ironic
voice
interrupted
again
those
were
extremes
to
be
sure
but
the
whole
meaning
wasnt
in
them
the
meaning
was
in
the
rights
of
man
emancipation
from
prejudice
the
equality
of
citizens
and
napoleon
kept
all
these
ideas
in
all
their
force
liberty
and
equality
the
viscount
said
scornfully
as
if
finally
deciding
to
prove
seriously
to
this
young
man
all
the
stupidity
of
his
talk
these
are
resounding
words
that
have
long
been
compromised
who
doesnt
love
liberty
and
equality
our
savior
already
preached
liberty
and
equality
did
people
become
happier
after
the
revolution
on
the
contrary
we
wanted
liberty
but
bonaparte
destroyed
it
prince
andrei
kept
glancing
with
a
smile
now
at
pierre
now
at
the
viscount
now
at
the
hostess
for
the
first
moment
of
pierres
outburst
anna
pavlovna
was
horrified
accustomed
though
she
was
to
society
but
when
she
saw
that
despite
the
blasphemous
speeches
uttered
by
pierre
the
viscount
did
not
lose
his
temper
and
when
she
became
certain
that
it
was
now
impossible
to
suppress
these
speeches
she
gathered
her
forces
and
joining
the
viscount
attacked
the
orator
mais
mon
cher
monsieur
pierre
said
anna

how
do
you
explain
a
great
man
who
could
execute
a
duke
or
finally
any
simple
man
without
a
trial
and
without
guilt
id
like
to
ask
said
the
viscount
how
monsieur
explains
the
eighteenth
brumaire
was
that
not
a
deception
cest
un
escamotage
qui
ne
ressemble
nullement
224
la
mani232re
dagir
dun
grand
homme
and
the
prisoners
he
killed
in
africa
said
the
little
princess
its
terrible
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
cest
un
roturier
vous
aurez
beau
dire
said
prince
ippolit
msieur
pierre
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
looked
around
at
them
all
and
smiled
his
smile
was
not
like
that
of
other
people
blending
into
a
nonsmile
with
him
on
the
contrary
when
a
smile
came
his
serious
and
even
somewhat
sullen
face
vanished
suddenly
instantly
and
another
appearedchildish
kind
even
slightly
stupid
and
as
if
apologetic
to
the
viscount
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
it
was
clear
that
this
jacobin
was
not
at
all
as
frightening
as
his
words
everyone
fell
silent
do
you
want
him
to
answer
everybody
at
once
asked
prince
andrei
besides
in
the
acts
of
a
statesman
one
must
distinguish
among
the
acts
of
the
private
person
the
military
leader
and
the
emperor
so
it
seems
to
me
yes
yes
of
course
pierre
picked
up
gladdened
by
the
arrival
of
unexpected
help
its
impossible
not
to
admit
prince
andrei
went
on
that
napoleon
was
a
great
man
on
the
bridge
of
arcole
and
in
the
jaffa
hospital
when
he
shook
hands
with
the
plague
victims
butthere
are
other
acts
which
are
hard
to
justify
prince
andrei
who
evidently
wanted
to
soften
the
awkwardness
of
pierres
speech
got
up
intending
to
leave
and
making
a
sign
to
his
wife
suddenly
prince
ippolit
rose
and
gesturing
for
everyone
to
stay
and
sit
down
began
to
speak
ah
aujourdhui
on
ma
racont233
une
anecdote
moscovite
charmante
il
faut
que
je
vous
en
r233gale
vous
mexcusez
vicomte
il
faut
que
je
raconte
en
russe
autrement
on
ne
sentira
pas
le
sel
de
lhistoire
and
prince
ippolit
began
to
speak
in
russian
with
a
pronunciation
such
as
frenchmen
have
after
spending
a
year
in
russia
everyone
stayed
so
animatedly
so
insistently
did
prince
ippolit
call
for
attention
to
his
story
in
moscou
there
is
a
ladee
une
dame
and
she
is
very
stingee
she
must
ave
two
valets
de
pied
behind
the
carriage
and
of
very
grand
height
that
was
in
her
taste
now
she
ad
une
femme
de
chambre
also
of
grand
height
she
said
here
prince
ippolit
fell
to
thinking
evidently
having
a
hard
time
working
it
out
she
saidyes
she
said
girl
to
the
femme
de
chambre
put
on
a
livr233e
and
come
with
me
behind
the
carriage
faire
des
visites
here
prince
ippolit
snorted
and
guffawed
far
in
advance
of
his
listeners
which
produced
an
impression
unfavorable
to
the
narrator
many
smiled
however
the
elderly
lady
and
anna
pavlovna
among
them
so
she
went
suddenly
there
was
a
strong
wind
the
girl
lost
her
hat
and
her
long
hairs
came
undone
here
he
could
no
longer
control
himself
and
began
laughing
fitfully
saying
through
his
laughter
and
the
whole
world
found
out
with
that
the
anecdote
ended
though
it
was
not
clear
why
he
had
told
it
and
why
it
absolutely
had
to
be
told
in
russian
all
the
same
anna
pavlovna
and
the
others
appreciated
prince
ippolits
social
grace
in
thus
pleasantly
putting
an
end
to
msieur
pierres
unpleasant
and
ungracious
outburst
after
the
anecdote
the
conversation
broke
up
into
small
insignificant
commentaries
on
past
and
future
balls
on
performances
and
on
who
would
see
whom
when
and
where
v
having
thanked
anna
pavlovna
for
her
charmante
soir233e
the
guests
began
to
leave
pierre
was
clumsy
fat
unusually
tall
broad
with
enormous
red
hands
he
did
not
as
they
say
know
how
to
enter
a
salon
and
still
less
did
he
know
how
to
leave
one
that
is
by
saying
something
especially
pleasant
at
the
door
besides
that
he
was
absentminded
getting
up
he
took
a
threecornered
hat
with
a
generals
plumage
instead
of
his
own
and
held
on
to
it
plucking
at
the
feathers
until
the
general
asked
him
to
give
it
back
but
all
his
absentmindedness
and
inability
to
enter
a
salon
and
speak
in
it
were
redeemed
by
his
expression
of
good
nature
simplicity
and
modesty
anna
pavlovna
turned
to
him
and
with
a
christian
meekness
expressing
forgiveness
for
his
outburst
nodded
to
him
and
said
i
hope
to
see
you
again
but
i
also
hope
that
you
will
change
your
opinions
my
dear
msieur
pierre
she
said
when
she
said
this
to
him
he
made
no
reply
but
only
bowed
and
once
more
showed
everyone
his
smile
which
said
nothing
except
perhaps
this
opinions
are
opinions
but
you
see
what
a
good
and
nice
fellow
i
am
and
everyone
including
anna
pavlovna
involuntarily
felt
it
prince
andrei
went
out
to
the
front
hall
and
offering
his
shoulders
to
the
footman
who
was
putting
his
cloak
on
him
listened
indifferently
to
his
wifes
chatter
with
prince
ippolit
who
also
came
out
to
the
front
hall
prince
ippolit
stood
beside
the
pretty
pregnant
princess
and
looked
at
her
directly
and
intently
through
his
lorgnette
go
in
annette
youll
catch
cold
said
the
little
princess
taking
leave
of
anna
pavlovna
cest
arr234t233
she
added
softly
anna
pavlovna
had
already
managed
to
speak
with
liza
about
the
match
she
was
contriving
between
anatole
and
the
little
princesss
sisterinlaw
im
relying
on
you
my

said
also
softly
youll

tell
me

and
she
left
the
front
hall
prince
ippolit
went
over
to
the
little
princess
and
bringing
his
face
down
close
to
hers
began
saying
something
to
her
in
a
half
whisper
two
footmen
one
the
princesss
the
other
his
waiting
for
them
to
finish
talking
stood
with
shawl
and
redingote
and
listened
to
their
french
talk
which
they
could
not
understand
with
such
faces
as
if
they
understood
what
was
being
said
but
did
not
want
to
show
it
the
princess
as
usual
talked
smilingly
and
listened
laughingly
im
very
glad
i
didnt
go
to
the
ambassadors
said
prince
ippolit
its
boringa
wonderful
evening
wonderful
isnt
it
so
they
say
the
ball
will
be
very
nice
replied
the
princess
her
slightly
mustached
lip
pulling
upwards
all
the
beautiful
society
women
will
be
there
not
all
since
you
wont
be
there
not
all
said
prince
ippolit
laughing
joyfully
and
snatching
the
shawl
from
the
footman
even
shoving
him
he
began
putting
it
on
the
princess
either
from
awkwardness
or
intentionally
no
one
would
have
been
able
to
tell
he
was
a
long
while
lowering
his
arms
even
when
the
shawl
was
already
put
on
and
it
was
as
if
he
was
embracing
the
young
woman
graciously
but
still
smiling
she
withdrew
turned
and
looked
at
her
husband
prince
andreis
eyes
were
shut
which
made
him
look
tired
and
sleepy
are
you
ready
madame
he
asked
his
wife
looking
past
her
prince
ippolit
hastily
put
on
his
redingote
which
in
the
new
style
hung
lower
than
his
heels
and
tangling
himself
in
it
ran
to
the
porch
after
the
princess
whom
the
footman
was
helping
into
the
carriage
princesse
au
revoir
he
cried
his
tongue
getting
as
tangled
as
his
feet
the
princess
picking
up
her
dress
was
settling
herself
in
the
darkness
of
the
carriage
her
husband
was
straightening
his
sword
prince
ippolit
on
the
pretext
of
being
of
service
got
in
everyones
way
excuse
me
sir
prince
andrei
with
dry
unpleasantness
addressed
himself
in
russian
to
prince
ippolit
who
was
standing
in
his
way
ill
be
waiting
for
you
pierre
the
same
voice
of
prince
andrei
said
gently
and
tenderly
the
postilion
touched
up
the
horses
and
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
rumbled
prince
ippolit
laughed
fitfully
standing
on
the
porch
and
waiting
for
the
viscount
whom
he
had
promised
to
take
home
eh
bien
mon
cher
votre
petite
princesse
est
tr232s
bien
tr232s
bien
said
the
viscount
getting
into
the
carriage
with
ippolit
mais
tr232s
bien
he
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
et
tout224fait
fran231aise
ippolit
laughed
with
a
snort
et
savezvous
que
vous
234tes
terrible
avec
votre
petit
air
innocent
the
viscount
continued
je
plains
le
pauvre
mari
ce
petit
officier
qui
se
donne
des
airs
de
prince
r233gnant
ippolit
snorted
again
and
said
through
his
laughter
et
vous
disiez
que
les
dames
russes
ne
valaient
pas
les
dames
fran231aises
il
faut
savoir
sy
prendre
pierre
arriving
first
went
to
prince
andreis
study
being
a
familiar
of
the
house
and
as
was
his
habit
at
once
lay
down
on
the
sofa
took
the
first
book
that
caught
his
eye
from
the
shelf
it
was
caesars
commentaries
and
leaning
on
his
elbow
began
reading
it
from
the
middle
what
have
you
done
to
mademoiselle
scherer
shell
be
quite
ill
now
said
prince
andrei
coming
into
his
study
and
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
pierre
swung
his
whole
body
so
that
the
sofa
creaked
turned
his
animated
face
to
prince
andrei
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
no
that
abb233
is
very
interesting
only
he
has
the
wrong
notion
of
thingsin
my
opinion
eternal
peace
is
possible
but
i
dont
know
how
to
say
itonly
its
not
through
political
balance
prince
andrei
was
obviously
not
interested
in
these
abstract
conversations
mon
cher
you
cant
go
saying
what
you
think
everywhere
well
so
have
you
finally
decided
on
anything
are
you
going
to
be
a
horse
guard
or
a
diplomat
prince
andrei
asked
after
a
moments
silence
pierre
sat
up
on
the
sofa
with
both
legs
tucked
under
him
can
you
imagine
i
still
dont
know
i
dont
like
either
of
them
but
you
must
decide
on
something
your
fathers
waiting
at
the
age
of
ten
pierre
had
been
sent
abroad
with
an
abb233tutor
and
had
remained
there
until
he
was
twenty
when
he
returned
to
moscow
his
father
dismissed
the
abb233
and
said
to
the
young
man
go
to
petersburg
now
look
around
and
choose
ill
agree
to
anything
heres
a
letter
to
prince
vassily
and
heres
some
money
write
to
me
about
everything
ill
help
you
in
everything
pierre
had
been
choosing
a
career
for
three
months
already
and
had
done
nothing
this
was
the
choice
that
prince
andrei
was
talking
about
with
him
pierre
rubbed
his
forehead
but
he
must
be
a
mason
he
said
meaning
the
abb233
he
had
seen
at
the
soir233e
thats
all
rubbish
prince
andrei
stopped
him
again
better
lets
talk
about
business
have
you
been
to
the
horse
guards
no
i
havent
but
heres
whats
come
into
my
head
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
theres
war
now
against
napoleon
if
it
were
a
war
for
freedom
i
could
understand
it
id
be
the
first
to
go
into
military
service
but
to
help
england
and
austria
against
the
greatest
man
in
the
worldis
not
right
prince
andrei
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
pierres
childish
talk
he
made
it
look
as
though
he
could
not
reply
to
such
stupidity
but
in
fact
it
was
hard
to
reply
to
this
na239ve
question
in
any
other
way
than
prince
andrei
had
done
if
everyone
made
war
only
according
to
his
own
convictions
there
would
be
no
war
he
said
and
that
would
be
excellent
said
pierre
prince
andrei
smiled
it
might
very
well
be
excellent
but
it
will
never
happen
well
what
makes
you
go
to
war
asked
pierre
what
makes
me
i
dont
know
i
have
to
besides
im
going
he
paused
im
going
because
this
life
i
lead
here
this
lifeis
not
for
me
vi
there
was
the
rustle
of
a
womans
dress
in
the
next
room
prince
andrei
shook
himself
as
if
coming
to
his
senses
and
his
face
took
on
the
same
expression
it
had
had
in
anna
pavlovnas
drawing
room
pierre
lowered
his
legs
from
the
sofa
the
princess
came
in
she
had
already
changed
to
a
house
dress
but
one
just
as
elegant
and
fresh
prince
andrei
stood
up
politely
moving
an
armchair
for
her
why
is
it
i
often
wonder
she
began
in
french
as
always
hurriedly
and
fussily
sitting
down
in
the
armchair
why
is
it
that
annette
has
never
married
how
stupid
you
all
are
messieurs
not
to
have
married
her
forgive
me
but
you
understand
nothing
about
women
youre
such
an
arguer
msieur
pierre
i
also
keep
arguing
with
your
husband
i
dont
understand
why
he
wants
to
go
to
the
war
said
pierre
without
any
constraint
so
usual
in
the
relations
of
a
young
man
with
a
young
woman
turning
to
the
princess
the
princess
gave
a
flutter
evidently
pierres
words
had
touched
her
to
the
quick
ah
thats
just
what
i
say
she
said
i
dont
understand
i
decidedly
do
not
understand
why
men
cant
live
without
war
why
is
it
that
we
women
want
none
of
it
and
have
no
need
of
it
well
you
be
the
judge
i
keep
telling
him
here
hes
his
uncles
adjutant
a
most
brilliant
position
hes
so
wellknown
so
appreciated
by
everyone
the
other
day
at
the
apraksins
i
heard
a
lady
ask
cest
231a
le
fameux
prince
andr233
ma
parole
dhonneur
she
laughed
hes
so
well
received
everywhere
he
could
easily
become
an
imperial
adjutant
you
know
the
sovereign
spoke
to
him
very
graciously
annette
and
i
were
saying
that
it
could
easily
be
arranged
what
do
you
think
pierre
looked
at
prince
andrei
and
noticing
that
his
friend
did
not
like
this
conversation
made
no
reply
when
do
you
go
he
asked
ah
ne
me
parlez
pas
de
ce
d233part
ne
men
parlez
pas
je
ne
veux
pas
en
entendre
parler
the
princess
said
in
the
same
capriciously
playful
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
with
ippolit
in
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
so
obviously
unsuited
to
the
family
circle
where
pierre
was
like
a
member
today
when
i
thought
how
id
have
to
break
off
all
these
dear
relationsand
then
you
know
andr233
she
winked
meaningfully
at
her
husband
jai
peur
jai
peur
she
whispered
her
back
shuddering
her
husband
looked
at
her
as
if
he
was
surprised
to
notice
there
was
someone
else
in
the
room
besides
himself
and
pierre
however
with
cold
politeness
he
inquiringly
addressed
his
wife
what
are
you
afraid
of
liza
i
cannot
understand
he
said
see
what
egoists
all
men
are
all
all
egoists
for
the
sake
of
his
whims
god
knows
why
he
abandons
me
he
locks
me
up
in
the
country
alone
with
my
father
and
sister
dont
forget
prince
andrei
said
quietly
alone
all
the
same
without
my
friendsand
he
wants
me
not
to
be
afraid
her
tone
was
querulous
now
her
little
lip
rose
giving
her
face
not
a
joyful
but
an
animalish
squirrellike
expression
she
fell
silent
as
if
finding
it
indecent
to
speak
of
her
pregnancy
in
front
of
pierre
though
that
was
where
the
essence
of
the
matter
lay
i
still
havent
understood
de
quoi
vous
avez
peur
prince
andrei
said
slowly
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
wife
the
princess
blushed
and
waved
her
hands
desperately
non
andr233
je
dis
que
vous
avez
tellement
tellement
chang233
your
doctor
tells
you
to
go
to
bed
earlier
said
prince
andrei
you
should
get
some
sleep
the
princess
said
nothing
and
her
short
lip
with
its
little
mustache
suddenly
trembled
prince
andrei
getting
up
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
began
to
pace
the
room
pierre
gazed
wonderingly
and
na239vely
through
his
spectacles
now
at
him
now
at
the
princess
and
stirred
as
if
he
also
wanted
to
get
up
but
changed
his
mind
again
what
do
i
care
if
msieur
pierre
is
here
the
little
princess
said
suddenly
and
her
pretty
face
suddenly
spread
into
a
tearful
grimace
ive
long
wanted
to
say
to

no
pity
for
me
why

it
lise
was
all
prince
andrei
said
but
in
this
word
there
was
an
entreaty
and
a
threat
and
above
all
the
conviction
that
she
herself
would
regret
her
words
but
she
hurriedly
went
on
you
treat
me
like
a
sick
person
or
a
child
i
see
it
all
you
werent
like
this
six
months
ago
lise
i
beg
you
to
stop
prince
andrei
said
still
more
expressively
pierre
who
was
becoming
more
and
more
agitated
during
this
conversation
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
princess
he
seemed
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
tears
and
was
about
to
start
crying
himself
calm
yourself
princess
it
seems
so
to
you
because

by
the
arm
no

pierre
the
princess
is
so
good
that
she
will
not
want
to
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
of
spending
an
evening
with
you
no
he
thinks
only
of
himself
said
the
princess
not
holding
back
her
angry
tears
lise
prince
andrei
said
drily
raising
his
tone
to
a
degree
which
showed
that
his
patience
had
run
out
suddenly
the
angry
squirrellike
expression
on
the
princesss
beautiful
little
face
changed
to
an
attractive
and
compassionprovoking
expression
of
fear
her
pretty
eyes
glanced
from
under
her
eyebrows
at
her
husband
and
her
face
acquired
the
timid
and
admissive
look
of
a
dog
rapidly
but
weakly
wagging
its
drooping
tail
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
said
the
princess
and
taking
up
a
fold
of
her
dress
in
one
hand
she
went
over
to
her
husband
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
bonsoir
lise
said
prince
andrei
standing
up
and
kissing
her
hand
politely
as
if
she
were
a
stranger
the
friends
were
silent
neither
of
them
would
begin
talking
pierre
kept
glancing
at
prince
andrei
prince
andrei
was
rubbing
his
forehead
with
his
small
hand
lets
go
and
have
supper
he
said
with
a
sigh
getting
up
and
heading
for
the
door
they
went
into
the
elegantly
newly
richly
decorated
dining
room
everything
from
the
napkins
to
the
silverware
china
and
crystal
bore
that
special
stamp
of
newness
that
is
found
in
the
households
of
the
recently
married
in
the
middle
of
supper
the
prince
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
with
an
expression
of
nervous
irritation
such
as
pierre
had
never
seen
in
his
friend
before
began
to
talk
like
a
man
who
has
long
had
something
on
his
heart
and
suddenly
decides
to
speak
it
out
never
never
marry
my
friend
heres
my
advice
to
you
dont
marry
until
you
can
tell
yourself
that
youve
done
all
you
could
and
until
youve
stopped
loving
the
woman
youve
chosen
until
you
see
her
clearly
otherwise
youll
be
cruelly
and
irremediably
mistaken
marry
when
youre
old
and
good
for
nothingotherwise
all
thats
good
and
lofty
in
you
will
be
lost
it
will
all
go
on
trifles
yes
yes
yes
dont
look
at
me
with
such
astonishment
if
you
expect
something
from
yourself
in
the
future
then
at
every
step
youll
feel
that
its
all
over
for
you
its
all
closed
except
the
drawing
room
where
youll
stand
on
the
same
level
as
a
court
flunkey
and
an
idiotah
well
he
waved
his
hand
energetically
pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
which
made
his
face
change
expressing
still
more
kindness
and
looked
at
his
friend
in
astonishment
my
wife
prince
andrei
went
on
is
a
wonderful
woman
shes
one
of
those
rare
women
with
whom
one
can
be
at
ease
regarding
ones
own
honor
but
my
god
what
wouldnt
i
give
now
not
to
be
married
youre
the
first
and
only
one
im
saying
this
to
because
i
love
you
prince
andrei
in
saying
this
was
less
than
ever
like
that
bolkonsky
who
sat
sprawled
in
anna
pavlovnas
armchair
and
narrowing
his
eyes
uttered
french
phrases
through
his
teeth
his
dry
face
was
all
aquiver
with
the
nervous
animation
of
every
muscle
his
eyes
in
which
the
fire
of
life
had
seemed
extinguished
now
shone
with
a
bright
radiant
brilliance
one
could
see
that
the
more
lifeless
he
seemed
in
ordinary
times
the
more
energetic
he
was
in
moments
of
irritation
you
dont
understand
why
im
saying
this
he
went
on
yet
its
a
whole
lifes
story
you
talk
of
bonaparte
and
his
career
he
said
though
pierre
had
not
talked
of
bonaparte
you
talk
of
bonaparte
but
bonaparte
when
he
was
working
went
step
by
step
towards
his
goal
he
was
free
he
had
nothing
except
his
goaland
he
reached
it
but
bind
yourself
to
a
womanand
like
a
prisoner
in
irons
you
lose
all
freedom
and
whatever
hope
and
strength
you
have
in
you
it
all
only
burdens
and
torments
you
with
remorse
drawing
rooms
gossip
balls
vanity
trivialitythat
is
the
vicious
circle
i
cant
get
out
of
im
now
going
to
the
war
to
the
greatest
war
that
has
ever
been
yet
i
know
nothing
and
am
good
for
nothing
je
suis
tr232s
aimable
et
tr232s
caustique
prince
andrei
went
on
and
they
listen
to
me
at
anna
pavlovnas
and
this
stupid
society
without
which
my
wife
cannot
live
and
these
womenif
you
only
knew
what
toutes
les
femmes
distingu233es
and
women
in
general
really
are
my
father
is
right
egoism
vanity
dullwittedness
triviality
in
everythingthats
women
when
they
show
themselves
as
they
are
looking
at
them
in
society
it
seems
theres
something
there
but
theres
nothing
nothing
nothing
no
dont
marry
dear
heart
dont
marry
prince
andrei
concluded
i
find
it
funny
said
pierre
that
you
you
yourself
consider
that
you
have
no
ability
and
that
your
life
is
a
ruined
life
you
have
everything
everything
ahead
of
you
and
you
he
did
not
say
you
what
but
his
tone
already
showed
how
highly
he
valued
his
friend
and
how
much
he
expected
from
him
in
the
future
how
can
he
say
that
thought
pierre
pierre
considered
prince
andrei
the
model
of
all
perfections
precisely
because
prince
andrei
united
in
the
highest
degree
all
those
qualities
which
pierre
did
not
possess
and
which
could
be
most
nearly
expressed
by
the
notion
of
strength
of
will
pierre
always
marveled
at
prince
andreis
ability
to
deal
calmly
with
all
sorts
of
people
at
his
extraordinary
memory
his
erudition
he
had
read
everything
knew
everything
had
notions
about
everything
and
most
of
all
at
his
ability
to
work
and
learn
if
pierre
had
often
been
struck
by
andreis
lack
of
ability
for
dreamy
philosophizing
for
which
pierre
had
a
particular
inclination
he
saw
it
not
as
a
defect
but
as
a
strength
in
the
best
the
friendliest
and
simplest
relations
flattery
or
praise
is
necessary
just
as
grease
is
necessary
to
keep
wheels
turning
je
suis
un
homme
fini
said
prince
andrei
why
talk
about
me
lets
talk
about
you
he
said
pausing
and
smiling
at
his
comforting
thoughts
this
smile
was
instantly
reflected
on
pierres
face
but
what
is
there
to
say
about
me
asked
pierre
spreading
his
mouth
into
a
carefree
merry
smile
what
am
i
je
suis
un
b226tard
and
he
suddenly
flushed
crimson
one
could
see
that
it
had
cost
him
great
effort
to
say
that
sans
nom
sans
fortune
and
what
really
but
he
did
not
say
what
really
im
free
so
far
and
i
feel
fine
only
i
have
no
idea
where
to
make
my
start
i
seriously
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
prince
andrei
looked
at
him
with
kindly
eyes
but
in
his
friendly
gentle
gaze
a
consciousness
of
his
own
superiority
still
showed
youre
dear
to
me
especially
because
youre
the
only
live
person
in
our
whole
society
thats
fine
for
you
choose
whatever
you
like
its
all
the
same
youll
be
fine
anywhere
but
theres
one
thing
stop
going
to
those
kuragins
and
leading
that
sort
of
life
it
simply
doesnt
suit
you
all
this
carousing
with
hussars
and
all
que
voulezvous
mon
cher
said
pierre
shrugging
his
shoulders
les
femmes
mon
cher
les
femmes
i
dont
understand
replied
andrei
les
femmes
comme
il
faut
are
another
matter
but
les
femmes
of
kuragin
les
femmes
et
le
vin
i
dont
understand
pierre
lived
at
prince
vassily
kuragins
and
took
the
dissolute
life
of
his
son
anatole
the
same
one
they
planned
to
marry
to
prince
andreis
sister
in
order
to
reform
him
you
know
what
said
pierre
as
if
a
lucky
thought
had
unexpectedly
occurred
to
him
seriously
ive
been
thinking
that
for
a
long
time
with
this
life
i
cant
decide
or
even
consider
anything
i
have
a
headache
and
no
money
he
invited
me
tonight
but
i
wont
go
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
wont
go
anymore
word
of
honor
it
was
already
past
one
oclock
when
pierre
left
his
friends
house
it
was
a
duskless
petersburg
june
night
pierre
got
into
a
hired
carriage
with
the
intention
of
going
home
but
the
closer
he
came
the
more
he
felt
the
impossibility
of
falling
asleep
on
that
night
which
more
resembled
an
evening
or
a
morning
one
could
see
far
down
the
empty
streets
on
the
way
pierre
recalled
that
the
usual
gambling
company
was
to
gather
at
anatole
kuragins
that
evening
after
which
there
was
usually
drinking
ending
with
one
of
pierres
favorite
amusements
it
would
be
nice
to
go
to
kuragins
he
thought
but
at
once
he
remembered
the
word
of
honor
he
had
given
prince
andrei
not
to
visit
kuragin
but
at
once
as
happens
with
socalled
characterless
people
he
desired
so
passionately
to
experience
again
that
dissolute
life
so
familiar
to
him
that
he
decided
to
go
and
at
once
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
the
word
he
had
given
meant
nothing
because
before
giving
his
word
to
prince
andrei
he
had
also
given
prince
anatole
his
word
that
he
would
be
there
finally
he
thought
that
all
these
words
of
honor
were
mere
conventions
with
no
definite
meaning
especially
if
you
considered
that
you
might
die
the
next
day
or
something
so
extraordinary
might
happen
to
you
that
there
would
no
longer
be
either
honor
or
dishonor
that
sort
of
reasoning
often
came
to
pierre
destroying
all
his
decisions
and
suppositions
he
went
to
kuragins
driving
up
to
the
porch
of
a
large
house
near
the
horse
guards
barracks
in
which
anatole
lived
he
went
up
the
lighted
porch
the
stairs
and
entered
an
open
door
there
was
no
one
in
the
front
hall
empty
bottles
capes
galoshes
were
lying
about
there
was
a
smell
of
wine
the
noise
of
distant
talking
and
shouting
cards
and
supper
were
over
but
the
guests
had
not
dispersed
yet
pierre
threw
off
his
cape
and
went
into
the
first
room
where
the
remains
of
supper
lay
and
one
lackey
thinking
no
one
could
see
him
was
finishing
on
the
sly
what
was
left
of
the
wine
in
the
glasses
from
the
third
room
came
a
racket
guffawing
the
shouting
of
familiar
voices
and
the
roaring
of
a
bear
some
eight
young
men
were
crowded
busily
by
an
open
window
three
were
romping
with
a
young
bear
one
of
them
dragging
it
by
a
chain
trying
to
frighten
the
others
i
stake
a
hundred
on
stevens
shouted
one
make
sure
theres
no
holding

shouted
another
im

cried
a
third
break
the
grip
kuragin
let

a
bet
at
one
go
otherwise

shouted
a
fourth
yakov
lets
have
a
bottle
yakov
shouted
the
host
himself
a
tall
handsome
man
who
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
in
nothing
but
a
fine
shirt
open
on
his
chest
wait
gentlemen
heres
petrusha
my
dear
friend
he
turned
to
pierre
another
voice
that
of
a
not
very
tall
man
with
clear
blue
eyes
especially
striking
amidst
all
these
drunken
voices
by
its
sober
expression
shouted
from
the
window
come
herebreak
the
grip
this
was
dolokhov
an
officer
of
the
semyonovsky
regiment
a
notorious
gambler
and
duellist
who
lived
with
anatole
pierre
smiled
looking
around
merrily
i
dont
understand
a
thing
whats
up
he
asked
wait
hes
not
drunk
give
me
a
bottle
said
anatole
and
taking
a
glass
from
the
table
he
went
up
to
pierre
first
of
all
drink
pierre
started
drinking
glass
after
glass
looking
from
under
his
brows
at
the
drunken
guests
who
again
crowded
by
the
window
and
listening
to
their
talk
anatole
poured
the
wine
for
him
and
told
him
that
dolokhov
was
making
a
bet
with
the
englishman
stevens
a
sailor
who
was
there
that
he
dolokhov
could
drink
a
bottle
of
rum
sitting
in
the
thirdfloor
window
with
his
legs
hanging
out
well
drink
it
all
said
anatole
handing
pierre
the
last
glass
otherwise
i
wont
let
you
go
no
i
dont
want
to
said
pierre
pushing
anatole
away
and
he
went
over
to
the
window
dolokhov
was
holding
the
englishman
by
the
hand
and
clearly
distinctly
articulating
the
terms
of
the
bet
mainly
addressing
anatole
and
pierre
dolokhov
was
a
man
of
medium
height
curlyhaired
and
with
light
blue
eyes
he
was
about
twentyfive
like
all
infantry
officers
he
wore
no
mustache
and
his
mouth
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
face
was
entirely
visible
the
lines
of
his
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
curved
in
the
middle
the
upper
lip
came
down
energetically
on
the
sturdy
lower
lip
in
a
sharp
wedge
and
at
the
corners
something
like
two
smiles
were
constantly
formed
one
on
each
side
and
all
of
that
together
especially
combined
with
a
firm
insolent
intelligent
gaze
made
up
such
an
expression
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
notice
this
face
dolokhov
was
not
a
rich
man
and
had
no
connections
and
though
anatole
ran
through
tens
of
thousands
dolokhov
lived
with
him
and
managed
to
place
himself
so
that
anatole
and
all
those
who
knew
them
respected
dolokhov
more
than
anatole
dolokhov
gambled
at
all
games
and
almost
always
won
no
matter
how
much
he
drank
he
never
lost
his
clearheadedness
kuragin
and
dolokhov
were
both
celebrities
at
that
time
in
the
world
of
petersburg
scapegraces
and
carousers
a
bottle
of
rum
was
brought
two
lackeys
were
tearing
out
the
frame
that
prevented
one
from
sitting
on
the
outer
ledge
of
the
window
they
were
obviously
hurrying
and
intimidated
by
the
orders
and
shouts
of
the
surrounding
gentlemen
anatole
went
up
to
the
window
with
his
victorious
look
he
wanted
to
break
something
he
pushed
the
lackeys
away
and
pulled
at
the
frame
but
the
frame
did
not
yield
he
smashed
a
pane
you
next
strongman
he
turned
to
pierre
pierre
took
hold
of
the
crosspieces
pulled
and
with
a
crash
here
broke
and
there
ripped
out
the
oak
frame
away
with
all
of
it
otherwise
theyll
think
im
holding
on
said
dolokhov
the
englishmans
boastingehall
right
said
anatole
all
right
said
pierre
looking
at
dolokhov
who
holding
the
bottle
of
rum
in
his
hand
was
approaching
the
window
through
which
the
light
of
the
sky
could
be
seen
and
the
glow
of
morning
and
evening
merging
in
it
dolokhov
jumped
up
into
the
window
with
the
bottle
of
rum
in
his
hand
listen
he
shouted
standing
on
the
windowsill
and
turning
to
the
room
everyone
fell
silent
i
put
down
he
spoke
in
french
so
that
the
englishman
would
understand
him
and
he
did
not
speak
the
language
all
that
well
i
put
down
fifty
imperialswant
to
make

he
added
addressing
the
englishman
no

said
the
englishman
very
well
fifty
imperials
that
i
will
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
rum
without
taking
it
from
my
lips
drink
it
sitting
outside
the
window
on
this
place
he
bent
down
and
indicated
the
sloping
ledge
outside
the
window
and
without
holding
on
to
anythingright
very
good
said
the
englishman
anatole
turned
to
the
englishman
and
taking
him
by
the
button
of
his
tailcoat
and
looking
at
him
from
above
the
englishman
was
short
began
repeating
the
terms
of
the
bet
to
him
in
english
wait
cried
dolokhov
tapping
the
bottle
against
the
window
to
attract
attention
wait
kuragin
listen
if
anybody
else
does
the
same
ill
pay
him
a
hundred
imperials
understood
the
englishman
nodded
his
head
in
no
way
making
clear
whether
he
did
or
did
not
accept
this
new
bet
anatole
did
not
let
go
of
the
englishman
and
though
he
had
nodded
to
show
he
had
understood
everything
anatole
translated
dolokhovs
words
into
english
for
him
a
young
lean
boy
a
lifehussar
who
had
gambled
away
everything
that
evening
climbed
up
on
the
window
stuck
his
head
out
and
looked
down
oooh
he
said
looking
out
the
window
at
the
stone
of
the
pavement
attention
cried
dolokhov
and
pulled
the
officer
from
the
window
getting
tangled
in
his
spurs
the
boy
jumped
down
awkwardly
into
the
room
after
placing
the
bottle
on
the
windowsill
to
have
it
conveniently
at
hand
dolokhov
slowly
and
carefully
climbed
into
the
window
lowering
his
legs
and
spreading
both
hands
against
the
sides
of
the
window
he
tried
his
position
settled
himself
let
go
with
his
hands
shifted
a
little
to
the
right
to
the
left
and
took
the
bottle
anatole
brought
two
candles
and
set
them
on
the
windowsill
though
it
was
already
quite
light
dolokhovs
back
in
its
white
shirt
and
his
curly
head
were
lit
up
from
both
sides
everyone
crowded
by
the
window
the
englishman
stood
in
front
pierre
smiled
and
said
nothing
one
of
those
present
older
than
the
others
with
a
frightened
and
angry
face
suddenly
moved
forward
and
was
about
to
seize
dolokhov
by
the
shirt
gentlemen
this
is
stupid
hell
kill
himself
said
this
more
reasonable
man
anatole
stopped
him
dont
touch
youll
frighten
him
and
hell
be
killed
ehwhat
theneh
dolokhov
turned
adjusting
his
position
and
again
spreading
his
hands
if
anybody
else
tries
to
get
at
me
he
said
slowly
forcing
the
words
through
his
compressed
and
thin
lips
ill
chuck
him
down
from
here
right
now
so
having
said
so
he
turned
back
again
let
go
with
his
hands
took
the
bottle
and
put
it
to
his
lips
threw
his
head
back
and
thrust
his
free
arm
up
for
balance
one
of
the
lackeys
who
had
begun
picking
up
the
glass
stopped
in
a
bent
position
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
window
and
dolokhovs
back
anatole
stood
erect
his
eyes
gaping
the
englishman
his
lips
thrust
out
watched
from
the
side
the
man
who
had
tried
to
stop
them
rushed
to
the
corner
of
the
room
and
lay
down
on
a
sofa
face
to
the
wall
pierre
covered
his
face
and
a
faint
smile
remained
forgotten
on
it
though
it
now
expressed
terror
and
fear
everyone
was
silent
pierre
took
his
hands
away
from
his
eyes
dolokhov
was
sitting
in
the
same
position
only
his
head
was
thrown
far
back
so
that
the
curly
hair
of
his
nape
touched
the
collar
of
his
shirt
and
the
hand
holding
the
bottle
rose
higher
and
higher
trembling
and
making
an
effort
the
bottle
was
apparently
emptying
and
rising
at
the
same
time
pushing
the
head
back
why
is
it
taking
so
long
thought
pierre
it
seemed
to
him
that
more
than
half
an
hour
had
gone
by
suddenly
dolokhov
made
a
backward
movement
and
his
arm
trembled
nervously
this
shudder
was
enough
to
shift
his
whole
body
which
was
sitting
on
the
sloping
ledge
he
shifted
completely
and
his
arm
and
head
trembled
still
more
from
the
effort
one
arm
rose
to
take
hold
of
the
windowsill
but
lowered
itself
again
pierre
again
shut
his
eyes
and
said
to
himself
that
he
was
never
going
to
open
them
suddenly
he
felt
everything
around
him
stirring
he
looked
dolokhov
was
standing
on
the
windowsill
his
face
pale
and
merry
empty
he
tossed
the
bottle
to
the
englishman
who
deftly
caught
it
dolokhov
jumped
down
from
the
window
he
smelled
strongly
of
rum
excellent
good
boy

a
bet
for
you
devil

you
all
they
cried
on
all
sides
the
englishman
having
produced
his
purse
counted
out
the
money
dolokhov
frowned
and
said
nothing
pierre
climbed
into
the
window
gentlemen

pierre
cried
pounding
the
table
with
a
determined
and
drunken
gesture
and
he
climbed
into
the
window
they
seized
him
by
the
arms
but
he
was
so
strong
that
he
pushed
those
who
came
near
him
far
away
no

said
anatole

he
seized
the
bear
and
hugging
him
and
lifting
him
up
began
waltzing
around
the
room
with
him
vii

solicited
him
for
her
only
son
boris
a
report
on
him
was
made
to
the
sovereign
and
unlike
others
he
was
transferred
to
the
semyonovsky
guards
regiment
as
an
ensign
but
boris
was
not
to
be
appointed
adjutant
or
attach233
to
kutuzov
despite
all
anna

soliciting
and
scheming
soon
after

anna

returned
to
moscow
straight
to
her
rich
relations
the
rostovs
with
whom
she
stayed
in

and
with
whom
her
adored

just
made
an
ensign
in
the
army
and
transferred
to
the
guards
had
been
brought
up
and
had
lived
for
years
the
guards

already
left
petersburg
on
the
tenth
of
august
and
her
son
who
had
remained
in
moscow
to
equip
himself
was
to
catch
up
with

and
leaving

with
congratulations
to
the

on
povarskaya
street
which
was
known
to
all
moscow
the
countess
with
her
beautiful
older
daughter
and
the
guests
who
constantly
replaced
each
other
were
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
the
countess
was
a
woman
with
a
thin
oriental
type
of
face
fortyfive
years
old
evidently
worn
out
by
children
of
whom
she
had
had
twelve
the
slowness
of
her
movements
and
speech
caused
by
weakness
gave
her
an
air
of
importance
that
inspired
respect
princess
anna
mikhailovna
drubetskoy
as
a
member
of
the
household
sat
right
there
helping
with
the
business
of
receiving
the
guests
and
occupying
them
with
conversation
the
young
people
were
in
the
back
rooms
finding
it
unnecessary
to
take
receiving
visits
the
count
met
the
guests
and
saw
them
off
inviting
them
all
to
dinner
much
obliged
to
you
ma

he
said
ma
ch232re
or
mon

to
everyone
without
exception
and
without
the
slightest
nuance
whether
they
were
of
higher
or
lower
standing
than
himself
for
myself
and
the

ma

these
words
he
said
with
the
same
expression
on
his
full
cheerful
and
cleanshaven
face
with
the
same
strong
handshake
and
repeated
short
bows
to
everyone
without
exception
or
variation
having
seen
off
a
guest
the
count
would
return
to
the
gentleman
or
lady
who
was
still
in
the
drawing
room
moving
up
an
armchair
and
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
loves
life
and
knows
how
to
live
it
spreading
his
legs
dashingly
and
putting
his
hands
on
his
knees
he
would
sway
significantly
offer
his
surmises
about
the
weather
discuss
health
sometimes
in
russian
sometimes
in
very
poor
but
selfconfident
french
and
again
with
the
look
of
a
man
weary
but
firm
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duty
would
go
to
see
people
off
smoothing
the
thin
gray
hair
over
his
bald
spot
and
again
invite
them
to
dinner
occasionally
on
returning
from
the
front
hall
he
would
pass
through
the
conservatory
and
the
servants
room
to
a
big
marble
hall
where
a
table
of
eighty
settings
was
being
laid
and
looking
at
the
servants
carrying
silver
and
china
opening
out
tables
and
spreading
damask
tablecloths
he
would
call
dmitri
vassilievich
a
nobleman
who
managed
all
his
affairs
and
say
well
well
mitenka
see
that
its
all
nice
right
right
he
would
say
looking
over
the
enormous
openedout
table
the
main
things
the
setout
so
so
and
sighing
selfcontentedly
he
would
go
back
to
the
drawing
room
marya

the
countesss
enormous
footman
announced
in
a
bass
voice
coming
to
the
door
of
the
drawing
room
the
countess
pondered
and
took
a
pinch
from
a
gold
snuffbox
with
her
husbands
portrait
on
it
im
worn
out
with
these
visits
she
said

she
said
to
the
footman
in
a
sad
voice
as
if
to
say
well
so
finish
me
off
a
tall
stout
proudlooking
lady
and
her
roundfaced
smiling
daughter
came
into
the
room
rustling
their
skirts

womens
voices
were
heard
interrupting
each
other
and
merging
with
the
rustling
of
skirts
and
the
moving
of
chairs
that
sort
of
conversation
began
which
is
designed
to
last
just
long
enough
so
that
one
can
get
up
at
the
first
pause
with
a
rustling
of

say

and
again
with

of

go
back
to

put
on
a
fur
coat
or
a
cloak
and
drive
off
the
conversation
turned
to
the
main
news
of
the
town
at
that
timethe
illness
of
the
rich
and
famous
beau
of
catherines
time
old
count
bezukhov
and
his
illegitimate
son
pierre
who
had
behaved
so
improperly
at
anna
pavlovna
scherers
soir233e
im
very
sorry
for
the
poor
count
said
the
guest
he
was
in
poor
health
to
begin
with
and
now
this
distress
on
account
of
his
son
it
will
kill
him
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
countess
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
the
guest
was
talking
about
though
she
had
already
heard
the
cause
of
count
bezukhovs
distress
a
good
fifteen
times
its
modern
upbringing
while
still
abroad
the
guest
went
on
this
young
man
was
left
to
himself
and
now
in
petersburg
they
say
he
did
such
awful
things
that
hes
been
banished
by
the
police
you
dont
say
said
the
countess
he
chose
his
acquaintances
poorly
princess
anna
mikhailovna
mixed
in
prince
vassilys
son
he
and
a
certain
dolokhov
they
say
were
up
to
god
knows
what
and
theyve
both
suffered
for
it
dolokhov
has
been
broken
to
the
ranks
and
bezukhovs
son
has
been
banished
to
moscow
as
for
anatole
kuraginhis
father
somehow
hushed
it
up
but
they
did
banish
him
from
petersburg
why
what
on
earth
did
they
do
asked
the
countess
theyre
perfect
ruffians
especially
dolokhov
said
the
guest
hes
the
son
of
marya
ivanovna
dolokhov
such
a
respectable
lady
and
what
then
can
you
imagine
the
three
of
them
found
a
bear
somewhere
put
it
in
the
carriage
with
them
and
went
to
the
actresses
the
police
came
running
to
quiet
them
down
they
took
a
policeman
and
tied
him
back
to
back
with
the
bear
and
threw
the
bear
into
the
moika
so
the
bear
goes
swimming
about
with
the
policeman
on
him
a
fine
figure
the
policeman
must
have
cut
ma
ch232re
cried
the
count
dying
with
laughter
ah
how
terrible
what
is
there
to
laugh
at
count
but
the
ladies
could
not
help
laughing
themselves
they
barely
managed
to
save
the
poor
fellow
the
guest
went
on
thats
how
intelligently
the
son
of
count
kirill
vladimirovich
bezukhov
amuses
himself
she
added
and
i
heard
he
was
so
wellbred
and
intelligent
theres
what
all
this
foreign
upbringing
leads
to
i
hope
no
one
receives
him
here
despite
his
wealth
they
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
me
i
decidedly
refused
i
have
daughters
what
makes
you
say
this
young
man
is
so
wealthy
asked
the
countess
leaning
away
from
the
girls
who
at
once
pretended
they
were
not
listening
the
man
has
only
illegitimate
children
it
seemspierre
too
is
illegitimate
the
guest
waved
her
hand
he
has
a
score
of
them
i
should
think
princess
anna
mikhailovna
mixed
into
the
conversation
clearly
wishing
to
show
her
connections
and
her
knowledge
of
all
the
circumstances
of
society
the
thing
is
this
she
said
significantly
and
also
in
a
half
whisper
count
kirill
vladimirovichs
reputation
is
wellknownhes
lost
count
of
his
children
but
this
pierre
was
his
favorite
how
goodlooking
the
old
man
was
said
the
countess
even
last
year
ive
never
seen
a
handsomer
man
hes
quite
changed
now
said
anna
mikhailovna
so
as
i
was
about
to
say
she
went
on
prince
vassily
is
the
direct
heir
to
the
whole
fortune
through
his
wife
but
the
father
loved
pierre
very
much
concerned
himself
with
his
upbringing
and
wrote
to
the
sovereignso
that
when
he
dies
hes
so
poorly
that
they
expect
it
any
moment
and
lorrain
has
come
from
petersburg
no
one
knows
who
will
get
this
enormous
fortune
pierre
or
prince
vassily
forty
thousand
souls
and
millions
of
roubles
i
know
it
very
well
because
prince
vassily
told
me
himself
and
kirill
vladimirovich
is
my
uncle
twice
removed
through
my
mother
and
hes
boryas
godfather
she
added
as
if
ascribing
no
importance
to
this
circumstance
prince
vassily
came
to
moscow
yesterday
hes
going
to
do
some
inspecting
im
told
said
the
guest
yes
but
entre
nous
said
the
countess
its
a
pretext
hes
come
essentially
to
see
count
kirill
vladimirovich
having
learned
that
he
was
so
poorly
however
ma
ch232re
that
was
a
nice
stunt
said
the
count
and
noticing
that
the
elder
guest
was
not
listening
he
turned
to
the
young
ladies
a
fine
figure
that
policeman
cut
i
imagine
and
picturing
how
the
policeman
waved
his
arms
he
again
burst
into
resounding
bassvoiced
laughter
which
shook
his
whole
stout
body
as
people
laugh
who
always
eat
and
especially
drink
very
well
so
please
do
come
for
dinner
he
said
viii
silence
ensued
the
countess
looked
at
the
guest
with
a
pleasant
smile
without
concealing
however
that
she
would
not
be
upset
in
the
least
now
if
the
guest
got
up
and
left
the
guests
daughter
was
already
smoothing
her
dress
looking
questioningly
at
her
mother
when
suddenly
from
the
neighboring
room
came
the
sound
of
several
mens
and
womens
feet
running
to
the
door
the
crash
of
a

and
fallen
chair
and
a
thirteenyearold
girl
ran
in
bundling
something
in
her
short
muslin
skirt
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
obvious
that
she
had
run
so
far
inadvertently
miscalculating
the
distance
at
the
same
moment
a
student
in
a
raspberrycolored
collar
an
officer
of
the
guards
a
fifteenyearold
girl
and
a
fat
redcheeked
boy
in
a
childs
jacket
appeared
in
the
doorway
the
count
jumped
up
and
swaying
spread
his
arms
wide
around
the
running
girl

said
the

she
added
turning
to
the
mother
the
darkeyed
bigmouthed
not
beautiful
but
lively
girl
with
her
childs
bare
shoulders
popping
out
of
her
bodice
from
running
fast
with
her
black
ringlets
all
thrown
back
her
thin
bare
arms
her
little
legs
in
lacetrimmed
knickers
and
low
shoes
was
at
that
sweet
age
when
a
girl
is
no
longer
a
child
but
the
child
is
not
yet
a
young
lady
wriggling
out
of
her
fathers
arms
she
ran
to
her
mother
and
paying
no
attention
to
her
stern
remark
buried
her
flushed
face
in
her
mothers
lace
mantilla
and
laughed
she
laughed
at
something
talking
fitfully
about
the
doll
she
took
out
from
under
her
skirt
you
seemy
dollmimiyou
see
and
natasha
could
say
no
more
everything
seemed
funny
to
her
she
fell
on
her
mother
and
burst
into
such
loud
and
ringing
laughter
that
everyone
else
even
the
prim
guest
laughed
involuntarily
well
off
you
go
off
you
go
you
and
that
ugly
thing
said
the
mother
pushing
her
daughter
away
with
feigned
gruffness
this
is
my
younger
one
she
turned
to
her
guest
natasha
tearing
her
face
momentarily
from
her
mothers
lace
wrap
looked
up
at
her
through
tears
of
laughter
and
hid
her
face
again
the
guest
forced
to
admire
the
family
scene
found
it
necessary
to
take
some
it
tell
me
my
dear
she
said
addressing
natasha
what
is
this
mimi
to
you
your
daughter
it
must
be
natasha
did
not
like
the
tone
of
condescension
to
childish
talk
in
which
the
guest
addressed
her
she
made
no
reply
and
gave
the
guest
a
serious
look
meanwhile
all
this
younger
generationboris
the
officer
son
of
princess
anna
mikhailovna
nikolai
the
student
the
counts
eldest
son
sonya
the
counts
fifteenyearold
niece
and
little
petrusha
the
youngest
sonall
settled
themselves
in
the
drawing
room
and
obviously
tried
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
propriety
the
animation
and
gaiety
which
their
every
feature
still
breathed
it
was
clear
that
there
in
the
back
rooms
from
which
they
had
all
come
running
so
precipitously
the
talk
was
merrier
than
the
talk
here
about
town
gossip
the
weather
and
the
comtesse
apraksine
they
glanced
at
each
other
from
time
to
time
and
could
barely
hold
back
their
laughter
the
two
young
men
the
student
and
the
officer
friends
from
childhood
were
of
the
same
age
and
both
handsome
but
they
did
not
resemble
each
other
boris
was
a
tall
blond
youth
with
the
regular
fine
features
of
a
calm
and
handsome
face
nikolai
was
a
curlyhaired
young
man
not
very
tall
and
with
an
open
expression
of
the
face
on
his
upper
lip
a
little
black
hair
had
already
appeared
and
his
whole
face
expressed
impetuousness
and
rapturousness
nikolai
blushed
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
drawing
room
one
could
see
that
he
was
searching
for
something
to
say
and
could
not
find
it
boris
on
the
other
hand
got
his
bearings
at
once
and
told
calmly
jokingly
how
he
had
known
this
mimi
the
doll
when
she
was
still
a
young
girl
with
an
unspoiled
nose
how
she
had
grown
old
in
the
five
years
he
remembered
and
how
her
head
had
gotten
cracked
across
the
entire
skull
having
said
this
he
glanced
at
natasha
natasha
turned
away
from
him
glanced
at
her
younger
brother
who
with
his
eyes
shut
tight
was
shaking
with
soundless
laughter
and
unable
to
hold
herself
back
any
longer
jumped
down
and
ran
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
her
quick
feet
would
carry
her
boris
did
not
laugh
i
believe
you
also
wanted
to
go
maman
do
you
need
a
carriage
he
said
turning
to
his
mother
with
a
smile
yes
go
go
tell
them
to
make
ready
she
said
smiling
boris
quietly
went
to
the
door
and
followed
natasha
out
the
fat
boy
angrily
ran
after
them
as
if
vexed
at
the
disturbance
that
had
interfered
with
his
pursuits
ix
of
the
young
people
not
including
the
countesss
elder
daughter
who
was
four
years
older
than
her
sister
and
already
behaved
like
an
adult
and
the
young
lady
guest
only
nikolai
and
the
niece
sonya
remained
in
the
drawing
room
sonya
was
a
slender
diminutive
brunette
with
a
soft
gaze
shaded
by
long
eyelashes
a
thick
black
braid
wound
twice
around
her
head
and
a
sallow
tinge
to
the
skin
of
her
face
and
especially
of
her
bared
lean
but
gracefully
muscular
arms
and
neck
in
the
smoothness
of
her
movements
the
softness
and
suppleness
of
her
small
limbs
and
her
somewhat
sly
and
reserved
manner
she
resembled
a
pretty
but
not
yet
fully
formed
kitten
which
would
one
day
be
a
lovely
little
cat
she
evidently
considered
it
the
proper
thing
to
show
by
a
smile
her
interest
in
the
general
conversation
but
against
her
will
her
eyes
under
their
long
thick
lashes
kept
looking
with
such
passionate
girlish
adoration
at
her
cousin
who
was
leaving
for
the
army
that
her
smile
could
not
deceive
anyone
for
a
moment
and
it
was
clear
that
the
little
cat
crouched
down
only
in
order
to
leap
up
more
energetically
and
play
with
her
cousin
as
soon
as
they
like
boris
and
natasha
could
get
out
of
this
drawing
room
yes

the
old
count
addressing
the
guest
and
pointing
to
his
nikolai

and
a

archives
and
all

the
count
said
questioningly
yes
they
say

said
the
guest
theyve
been

for
a
long
time

the
count

he
repeated
hes
joining
the
hussars
the
guest
not
knowing
what
to
say
shook
her
head
not
at
all
out
of
friendship
replied
nikolai
blushing
and
protesting
as
if
it
was
a
shameful
calumny
its
not
friendship
i
simply
feel
a
calling
for
military
service
he
shot
a
glance
at
his
cousin
and
the
young
lady
guest
they
both
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
of
approval
tonight
schubert

be
dining
with

a
colonel
in
the
pavlogradsky
hussar
regiment

been
on
leave
here
and

taking
him
along
what
to
do
said
the
count
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
speaking
jokingly
about
a
matter
that
obviously
cost
him
much
grief
ive
already
told
you
papa
said
his
son
that
if
you
dont
want
to

good
for
anything
but
military
service
im
not
a
diplomat
not
a
functionary
im
unable
to
hide
my
feelings
he
said
glancing
all
the
while
with
the
coquetry
of
a
handsome
youth
at
sonya
and
the
young
lady
guest
the
little
cat
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
and
seemed
ready
at
any
instant
to
begin
playing
and
show
all
her
cat
nature
well
well
all
right
said
the
old
count
he
keeps
getting
heated
up
its
this
bonaparte
whos
turned
all
their
heads
they
all
wonder
how
it
is
that
from
the
lieutenants
he
landed
among
the
emperors
well
god
grant
it
he
added
not
noticing
the
guests
mocking
smile
the
adults
began
talking
about
bonaparte
julie
mme
karagins
daughter
turned
to
the
young
rostov
what
a
pity
you
werent
at
the
arkharovs
on
thursday
i
was
bored
without
you
she
said
smiling
tenderly
at
him
the
flattered
young
man
with
the
coquettish
smile
of
youth
sat
closer
to
her
and
got
into
a
separate
conversation
with
the
smiling
julie
completely
unaware
that
his
involuntary
smile
cut
the
heart
of
the
blushing
and
falsely
smiling
sonya
with
the
knife
of
jealousy
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
he
turned
to
look
at
her
sonya
gave
him
a
passionately
angry
look
and
barely
holding
back
the
tears
in
her
eyes
with
a
false
smile
on
her
lips
got
up
and
left
the
room
all
of
nikolais
animation
vanished
he
waited
for
the
first
lull
in
the
conversaton
and
with
an
upset
face
left
the
room
to
look
for
sonya
how
crystal
clear
all
these
young
ones
secrets
are
said
anna
mikhailovna
pointing
to
nikolai
as
he
left
cousinage
dangereux
voisinage
she
added
yes
said
the
countess
when
the
ray
of
sunlight
that
had
penetrated
the
room
with
the
young
generation
vanished
and
as
if
answering
a
question
no
one
had
asked
her
but
which
constantly
preoccupied
her
so
much
suffering
so
much
anxiety
endured
so
as
to
rejoice
in
them
now
and
now
too
theres
really
more
fear
than
joy
one
is
afraid
always
afraid
its
precisely
the
age
when
there
are
so
many
dangers
both
for
girls
and
for
boys
everything
depends
on
upbringing
said
the
guest
yes
true
for
you
the
countess
went
on
up
to
now
thank
god
ive
been
a
friend
to
my
children
and
have
enjoyed
their
full
trust
said
the
countess
repeating
the
error
of
many
parents
who
suppose
that
their
children
have
no
secrets
from
them
i
know
that
ill
always
be
my
daughters
first
confidente
and
that
if
nikolenka
with
his
fiery
character
gets
up
to
some
mischief
boys
cant
do
without
it
it
still
wont
be
the
same
as
with
these
petersburg
gentlemen
yes
nice
nice
children
agreed
the
count
who
always
resolved
all
tangled
questions
by
finding
everything
nice
just
look
at
him
decided
to
be
a
hussar
well
what
do
you
want
ma
ch232re
what
a
sweet
creature
your
younger
one
is
said
the
guest
a
ball
of
fire
yes
a
ball
of
fire
said
the
count
she
takes
after
me
and
what
a
voice
though
shes
my
daughter
ill
tell
you
the
truth
shell
be
a
singer
another
salomoni
weve
hired
an
italian
to
teach
her
isnt
it
too
early
they
say
it
harms
the
voice
to
study
at
that
age
oh
no
not
too
early
at
all
said
the
count
how
is
it
then
that
our
mothers
got
married
when
they
were
twelve
or
thirteen
shes
already
in
love
with
boris
now
what
a
one
said
the
countess
smiling
quietly
looking
at
boriss
mother
and
evidently
responding
to
the
thought
that
always
preoccupied
her
she
went
on
well
so
you
see
if
i
were
strict
with
her
if
i
forbade
hergod
knows
what
theyd
do
on
the
sly
the
countess
meant
they
would
be
kissing
but
now
i
know
her
every
word
shell
come
running
to
me
herself
in
the
evening
and
tell
me
everything
i
may
be
spoiling
her
but
it
really
seems
better
i
was
strict
with
the
elder
one
yes
i
was
brought
up
quite
differently
said
the
elder
one
the
beautiful
countess
vera
smiling
but
the
smile
did
not
embellish
veras
face
as
usually
happens
on
the
contrary
her
face
became
unnatural
and
therefore
unpleasant
the
elder
one
vera
was
goodlooking
far
from
stupid
an
excellent
student
wellbroughtup
had
a
pleasant
voice
and
what
she
said
was
correct
and
appropriate
but
strangely
everyone
both
the
guest
and
the
countess
turned
to
look
at
her
as
if
wondering
why
she
had
said
it
and
they
felt
awkward
one
is
always
too
clever
with
the
older
children
wanting
to
do
something
extraordinary
said
the
guest
theres
no
use
denying
it
ma
ch232re
the
dear
countess
was
too
clever
with
vera
said
the
count
well
so
what
she
still
turned
out
nice
he
added
winking
at
vera
approvingly
the
guests
got
up
and
left
promising
to
come
for
dinner
what
manners
they
sat
and
sat
said
the
countess
after
seeing
the
guests
off
x
when
natasha
left
the
drawing
room
and
ran
off
she
ran
no
further
than
the
conservatory
in
that
room
she
stopped
listening
to
the
talk
in
the
drawing
room
and
waiting
for
boris
to
come
out
she
was
already
growing
impatient
and
stamping
her
little
foot
was
about
to
cry
because
he
did
not
come
at
once
when
she
heard
the
neither
slow
nor
quick
but
proper
footsteps
of
the
young
man
natasha
quickly
darted
among
the
tubs
of
plants
and
hid
herself
boris
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
around
brushed
some
specks
of
dust
off
the
sleeve
of
his
uniform
with
his
hand
and
went
up
to
a
mirror
studying
his
handsome
face
natasha
kept
still
peeking
from
her
ambush
waiting
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
stood
for
some
time
before
the
mirror
smiled
and
walked
to
the
other
door
natasha
was
about
to
call
him
but
then
changed
her
mind
let
him
search
she
said
to
herself
as
soon
as
boris
left
the
flushed
sonya
came
from
the
other
door
whispering
something
spitefully
through
her
tears
natasha
restrained
her
first
impulse
to
rush
out
to
her
and
remained
in
her
ambush
as
if
under
the
cap
of
invisibility
observing
what
went
on
in
the
world
she
experienced
a
special
new
pleasure
sonya
was
whispering
something
and
kept
looking
back
at
the
door
of
the
drawing
room
nikolai
came
out
of
that
door
sonya
whats
wrong
how
can
you
said
nikolai
rushing
to
her
never
mind
never
mind
leave
me
alone
sonya
burst
into
sobs
no
i
know
what
it
is
so
you
know
and
thats
wonderful
and
so
go
to
her
sooonya
one
word
how
can
you
torment
me
and
yourself
so
because
of
a
fantasy
said
nikolai
taking
her
hand
sonya
did
not
pull
her
hand
away
and
stopped
crying
natasha
motionless
and
breathless
with
shining
eyes
watched
from
behind
her
ambush
what
will
happen
now
she
thought
sonya
the
whole
world
is
no
use
to
me
you
alone
are
everything
said
nikolai
ill
prove
it
to
you
i
dont
like
it
when
you
talk
like
that
well
then
i
wont
well
forgive
me
sonya
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
ah
how
nice
thought
natasha
and
when
sonya
and
nikolai
left
the
room
she
went
out
after
them
and
called
boris
boris
come
here
she
said
with
a
significant
and
sly
air
theres
something
i
must
tell
you
here
here
she
said
and
led
him
to
the
conservatory
to
the
place
between
the
tubs
where
she
had
been
hiding
boris
smiling
followed
her
what
is
this
something
he
asked
she
became
embarrassed
looked
around
and
seeing
her
doll
abandoned
on
a
tub
took
it
in
her
hands
kiss
the
doll
she
said
boris
looked
into
her
animated
face
with
attentive
gentle
eyes
and
said
nothing
you
dont
want
to
well
come
here
then
she
said
and
went
deeper
among
the
plants
and
dropped
her
doll
closer
closer
she
whispered
she
caught
the
officer
by
the
cuffs
with
both
hands
and
her
flushed
face
showed
solemnity
and
fear
and
do
you
want
to
kiss
me
she
whispered
barely
audibly
looking
at
him
from
under
her
eyebrows
smiling
and
almost
weeping
with
excitement
boris
blushed
youre
so
funny
he
said
bending
down
to
her
blushing
still
more
but
not
undertaking
anything
and
waiting
she
suddenly
jumped
up
onto
a
tub
becoming
taller
than
he
embraced
him
with
her
thin
bare
arms
which
bent
higher
than
his
neck
and
tossing
her
hair
back
with
a
movement
of
the
head
kissed
him
right
on
the
lips
she
slipped
between
the
pots
to
the
other
side
of
the
plants
and
stopped
her
head
lowered
natasha
he
said
you
know
i
love
you
but
youre
in
love
with
me
natasha
interrupted
yes

am
but
please

nowanother
four
yearsthen
ill

for
your
hand
natasha
reflected
thirteen
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
she
said
counting
on
her
thin
little
fingers
all
right
so
its
settled
and
a
smile
of
joy
and
reassurance
lit
up
her
animated
face
settled
said
boris
forever
said
the
girl
till
death
and
taking
him
under
the
arm
with
a
happy
face
she
slowly
walked
beside
him
to
the
sitting
room
xi
the
countess
was
so
tired
out
from
the
visits
that
she
ordered
no
one
else
to
be
received
and
the
porter
was
told
simply
to
be
sure
to
invite
for
dinner
everyone
who
came
by
with
congratulations
the
countess
wanted
to
talk
personally
with
her
childhood
friend
princess
anna
mikhailovna
whom
she
had
not
seen
properly
since
her
return
from
petersburg
anna
mikhailovna
with
her
weepy
and
pleasant
face
moved
closer
to
the
countesss
armchair
ill
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
said
anna
mikhailovna
there
are
few
of
us
old
friends
left
thats
why
i
cherish
your
friendship
so
much
anna
mikhailovna
looked
at
vera
and
stopped
the
countess
pressed
her
friends
hand
vera
said
the
countess
turning
to
her
older
daughter
obviously
not
her
favorite
how
is
it
you
have
no
notion
of
anything
cant
you
feel
that
youre
not
needed
here
go
to
your
sisters
or
the
beautiful
vera
smiled
disdainfully
apparently
not
feeling
the
slightest
offense
if
you
had
told
me
long
ago
mama
i
would
have
left
at
once
she
said
and
went
to
her
room
but
passing
through
the
sitting
room
she
noticed
two
couples
sitting
symmetrically
by
the
two
windows
she
stopped
and
smiled
disdainfully
sonya
was
sitting
close
to
nikolai
who
was
writing
out
some
verses
for
her
the
first
he
had
ever
written
boris
and
natasha
were
sitting
by
the
other
window
and
fell
silent
when
vera
came
in
sonya
and
natasha
looked
at
vera
with
guilty
and
happy
faces
it
was
amusing
and
touching
to
look
at
these
enamoured
girls
but
the
sight
of
them
evidently
did
not
arouse
any
pleasant
feelings
in
vera
how
many
times
have
i
asked
you
not
to
take
my
things
she
said
you
have
a
room
of
your
own
she
took
the
inkstand
from
nikolai
just
a
moment
he
said
dipping
his
pen
you
manage
to
do
everything
at
the
wrong
time
said
vera
the
way
you
came
running
into
the
drawing
room
just
now
everyone
was
ashamed
of
you
in
spite
of
or
precisely
because
of
the
fact
that
what
she
said
was
perfectly
correct
no
one
answered
her
and
the
four
only
exchanged
glances
with
each
other
she
lingered
in
the
room
with
the
inkstand
in
her
hand
and
what
secrets
can
there
be
at
your
age
between
natasha
and
boris
and
between
you
two
its
all
silliness
well
what
does
it
matter
to
you
vera
natasha
said
pleadingly
in
a
quiet
little
voice
clearly
that
day
she
was
being
kinder
and
more
affectionate
with
everyone
than
ever
very
silly
said
vera
im
ashamed
of
you
why
secrets
we
all
have
our
secrets
we
dont
bother
you
and
berg
natasha
said
flaring
up
of
course
you
dont
said
vera
because
there
can
never
be
anything
bad
in
my
actions
but
i
shall
tell
mama
how
you
behave
with
boris
natalya
ilyinichna
behaves
very
well
with
me
said
boris
i
cant
complain
he
said
stop
it
boris
youre
such
a
diplomat
the
word
diplomat
was
much
in
vogue
among
children
in
that
special
sense
they
endowed
it
with
its
even
boring
natasha
said
in
an
offended
trembling
voice
why
is
she
pestering
me
youll
never
understand
it
she
said
turning
to
vera
because
youve
never
loved
anybody
you
have
no
heart
youre
just
a
madame
de
genlis
this
nickname
considered
very
offensive
had
been
given
to
vera
by
nikolai
and
your
highest
pleasure
is
to
do
unpleasant
things
to
others
go
and
flirt
with
berg
as
much
as
you
like
she
said
quickly
i
certainly
wont
go
running
after
a
young
man
in
front
of
guests
well
shes
done
it
nikolai
mixed
in
shes
said
unpleasant
things
to
everybody
and
upset
everybody
lets
go
to
the
nursery
all
four
like
a
frightened
flock
of
birds
got
up
and
left
they
said
unpleasant
things
to
me
but
i
said
nothing
to
anybody
said
vera
madame
de
genlis
madame
de
genlis
laughing
voices
said
behind
the
door
the
beautiful
vera
who
had
such
an
irritating
unpleasant
effect
on
everyone
smiled
and
apparently
untouched
by
what
had
been
said
to
her
went
up
to
the
mirror
and
straightened
her
scarf
and
hair
looking
at
her
beautiful
face
she
appeared
to
become
even
colder
and
calmer
in
the
drawing
room
the
conversation
was
still
going
on
ah

the

replied
god

how
hard
it
is
to
be
left
a
widow
without
support
and
with
a
son
whom
you
love
to
distraction
one
learns
everything
she
went
on
with
a
certain
pride
my
lawsuit

taught
me
if

of
these
trumps
i
write

the
countess

your
son

an
officer
in
the
guards
and
nikolushka

a
junker

you
ask
prince
vassily
he
was
very
nice
he
agreed
at
once
to
do
everything
and
reported
to
the
emperor
princess
anna
mikhailovna
said
with
rapture
forgetting
entirely
about
all
the
humiliation
she
had
gone
through
to
achieve
her
goal
and
what
has
he
aged
prince
vassily
asked
the
countess
i
havent
seen
him
since
our
theater
performances
at
the
rumyantsevs
and
i
suppose
hes
forgotten
me
il

the
countess
remembered
with
a
smile
hes
the
same
as

replied
anna
mikhailovna
amiable

nathalie
i
dont
know
what
i
wouldnt
do
for
his
happiness
and
my
circumstances

so
bad
anna
mikhailovna
went
on
sadly
lowering
her
voice
so
bad
that
im
now
in
a
most
terrible
position
my
wretched
lawsuit
eats
up
all
i
have
and
doesnt
get
anywhere
can
you
imagine
i
dont
have
even
ten

224
la

and
i
dont

she
took
out
a
handkerchief
and
began
to
cry
i
need
five
hundred
roubles
and
all
i
have
is
one
twentyfiverouble
note

bezukhov
if
he
doesnt
care
to
support
his
godsonhes
boryas
godfatherand
lay
out
something
for

maintenance
all
my
troubles
will
have
been
in

i
wont
have
the
money
to
equip
him
the
countess
also
waxed
tearful
and
silently
pondered
something
i
often
thinkmaybe
its
sinful
said
the
princess
but
i
often
think
here
count
kirill
vladimirovich
bezukhov
lives
alonethis
enormous
fortuneand
what
does
he
live
for
lifes
a
burden
to

to
live
hell

the

these
rich
courtiers

such
egoists
but
even
so
ill

to
him
now
with
boris
and
tell
him
outright
what
its
about
let
them
think
whatever
they
like
of
me
it
really
makes
no
difference
to
me
when
my
sons

depends
on
it
the

added
in
a
whisper
so
that

not

the

the

and

her

replied
coldly
but
ive
promised

and
im
doing
it
for
you
despite
the
fact
that
someones
carriage
was
standing
at
the
entrance
the
porter
having
looked
over
the
mother
and
son
who
without
asking
to
be
announced
had
walked
directly
through
the
glass
entryway
between
two
rows
of
statues
in
niches
with
a
significant
glance
at
the
old
mantle
asked
whom
they
wanted
to
see
the
princesses
or
the
count
and
on
learning
that
it
was
the
count
said
that
his
excellency
was
feeling
worse
that
day
and
that
his
excellency
was
not
receiving
anyone

the
son

in
french
mon

the
mother
said
in
a
pleading
voice
again
touching
her
sons
hand
as
if
this
touch
could
calm
or
encourage
him
boris
fell
silent
and
without
taking
off
his
overcoat
looked
questioningly
at
his
mother
dearest
anna
mikhailovna
said
in
a
tender
little
voice
turning
to
the

the
porter
sullenly
pulled
the
bell
rope
that
rang
upstairs
and
turned
away
princess
drubetskoy
to
see
prince
vassily
sergeevich
he
called
out
to
the
servant
in
stockings
shoes
and
a
tailcoat
who
had
come
running
down
and
was
now
peering
from
the
turn
of
the
stairway
the
mother
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
redyed
silk
dress
looked
in
a
fulllength
venetian
mirror
on
the
wall
and
in
her
downatheel
shoes
went
briskly
up
the
carpet
of
the
stairs
mon
cher
vous
mavez

she
addressed
her
son
again
touching
his
hand
to
encourage
him
the
son
lowering
his
eyes
calmly
followed
after
her
they
entered
a
large
room
in
which
one
door
led
to
the
apartment
assigned
to
prince
vassily
as
the
mother
and
son
reached
the
middle
of
the
room
intending
to
ask
their
way
from
an
old
servant
who
had
jumped
up
when
they
came
in
the
bronze
handle
of
one
of
the
doors
turned
and
prince
vassily
in
an
informal
velvet
house
jacket
with
one
star
came
out
accompanying
a
handsome
darkhaired
man
this
man
was
the
famous
petersburg
doctor
lorrain
cest
donc
positif
the
prince
was
saying
mon
prince
errare
humanum
est
mais
the
doctor
replied
swallowing
his
rs
and
pronouncing
the
latin
words
with
a
french
accent
cest
bien
cest
bien
noticing
anna
mikhailovna
and
her
son
prince
vassily
dismissed
the
doctor
with
a
bow
and
silently
but
with
a
questioning
look
came
over
to
them
the
son
noticed
how
deep
grief
suddenly
appeared
in
his
mothers
eyes
and
smiled
slightly
yes
prince
we
meet
here
under
such
sad
circumstanceswell
how
is
our
dear
patient
she
said
as
if
oblivious
of
the
cold
insulting
gaze
directed
at
her
prince
vassily
looked
questioningly
to
the
point
of
bewilderment
at
her
then
at
boris
boris
bowed
courteously
prince
vassily
without
responding
to
the
bow
turned
to
anna
mikhailovna
and
replied
to
her
question
with
a
movement
of
the
head
and
lips
signifying
the
worst
hopes
for
the
patient
can
it
be
exclaimed
anna
mikhailovna
ah
its
terrible
im
afraid
to
thinkthis
is
my
son
she
added
pointing
to
boris
he
wanted
to
thank
you
himself
boris
once
more
bowed
courteously
believe
me
prince
a
mothers
heart
will
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
us
im
glad
that
i
could
give
you
pleasure
my
dearest
anna
mikhailovna
said
prince
vassily
straightening
his
jabot
and
in
his
gesture
and
voice
displaying
here
in
moscow
before
the
patronized
anna
mikhailovna
far
greater
importance
than
in
petersburg
at
annette

try
to
serve
well
and
be

he
added
sternly
addressing
boris
im
gladyoure
here
on
leave
he
dictated
in
his
passionless
tone
awaiting
orders
your
excellency
to
be
dispatched
to
my
new
assignment
replied
boris
showing
neither
vexation
at
the
princes
abrupt
tone
nor
the
wish
to
get
into
conversation
but
so
calmly
and
deferentially
that
the
prince
looked
at
him
intently
you
live
with
your
mother
i
live
at
the
countess
rostovs
said
boris
again
adding
your
excellency
its

observed
anna
mikhailovna
smiling
touchingly
as
though
she
too
knew
that
count
rostov
deserved
such
an
opinion
but
begged
for
pity
on
the
poor
old
man
what
do
the
doctors
say
the
princess
asked
after
a
brief
pause
and
again
showing
great
sorrow
on
her
weepy
face
theres
little
hope
said
the
prince
and
i
wished
so
much
to
thank
uncle
for
all
his
benefactions
to
me
and
to
borya
cest

she
added
in
such
a
tone
as
though
this
news
was
to
make
prince
vassily
extremely
glad
prince
vassily
pondered
and
winced
anna
mikhailovna
understood
that
he
feared
to
find
in
her
a
rival
over
count
bezukhovs
will
she
hastened
to
reassure
him
if
it
werent
for
my
true
love
and
devotion
to
uncle
she
said
uttering
this
word
with
special
assurance
and
casualness
i
know
his
character
noble
direct
but
there
are
just
the
princesses
around
himtheyre
still
young
she
inclined
her
head
and
added
in
a
whisper
has
he
fulfilled
his
last
duty
prince

precious
these
last
moments
are

get
any
worse

poorly

she
smiled
tenderly

how
to
say
these
things
prince
i
must
see
him
however
hard
it
is
for
me
by
now
im
used
to
suffering
the
prince
apparently
realized
as
at
annette
scherers
soir233e
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
rid
of
anna

this
meeting
might
be
hard
on

he
said

wait
till

the
doctors
have
predicted
a
crisis
but
we
cannot

at
such
a
moment

the
door
to
the
inner
rooms
opened
and
one
of
the
young
princessesthe
counts
niecescame
out
with
a
cold
and
sullen
face
and
a
long
waist
strikingly
out
of
proportion
with
her
legs
prince
vassily
turned
to
her
well
how
is
he
the
same
and
like
it
or
not
this
noise
said
the
princess
looking
anna
mikhailovna
over
like
a
stranger
ah

anna

said
with
a
happy
smile
approaching
the
counts
niece
at
a
light
amble

she
added
rolling
up
her
eyes
sympathetically
the
princess
made
no
reply
did
not
even
smile
and
left
at
once
anna
mikhailovna
took
off
her
gloves
and
settled
into
a
hardwon
position
in
an
armchair
inviting
prince
vassily
to
sit
down
beside
her
boris
she
said
to
her
son
and
smiled
ill
go
to
the
count
my
uncle
and
meanwhile
you
go
to
pierre
mon
ami
and
dont
forget
to
convey
to
him
the
invitation
from
the
rostovs
theyre
inviting
him
to
dinner
he
wont
go
i
suppose
she
turned
to
the
prince
on
the
contrary
said
the
prince
now
plainly
out
of
sorts
je

vous
me
d233barassez
de
ce
jeune

he
just
sits
here
the
count
has
never
once
asked
about
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
servant
led
the
young
man
down
and
up
another
stairway
to
pyotr
kirillovich
xiii
pierre
had
not
managed
to
choose
a
career
for
himself
in
petersburg
and
had
indeed
been
banished
to
moscow
for
riotous
behavior
the
story
told
at
count
rostovs
was
true
pierre
had
taken
tying
the
policeman
to
the
bear
he
had
arrived
several
days
ago
and
was
staying
as
usual
at
his
fathers
house
though
he
supposed
that
his
story
was
already
known
in
moscow
and
that
the
ladies
who
surrounded
his
father
always
illdisposed
towards
him
would
have
used
this
chance
to
rile
the
count
he
nevertheless
went
to
his
fathers
the
house
the
day
he
arrived
on
entering
the
drawing
room
where
the
princesses
were
usually
to
be
found
he
greeted
the
ladies
who
were
sitting
over
their
embroidery
and
a
book
which
one
of
them
was
reading
aloud
there
were
three
of
them
the
eldest
a
neat
longwaisted
stern
young
lady
the
one
who
had
come
out
to
anna
mikhailovna
was
reading
the
younger
ones
both
redcheeked
and
pretty
differing
from
each
other
only
in
that
one
had
a
mole
above
her
lip
which
was
very
becoming
to
her
were
doing
embroidery
pierre
was
met
like
a
dead
man
or
a
leper
the
eldest
princess
interrupted
her
reading
and
silently
stared
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
the
younger
one
without
the
mole
assumed
exactly
the
same
expression
the
youngest
with
the
mole
of
a
merry
laughterprone
character
bent
over
her
embroidery
frame
to
hide
a
smile
probably
evoked
by
the
forthcoming
scene
which
she
foresaw
would
be
amusing
she
drew
the
woollen
thread
through
and
bent
down
as
if
studying
the
design
barely
able
to
keep
from
laughing
bonjour
ma
cousine
said
pierre
vous
ne
me
reconnaissez
pas
i
recognize
you
only
too
well
only
too
well
how
is
the
counts
health
may
i
see
him
pierre
asked
awkwardly
as
usual
but
without
embarrassment
the
count
is
suffering
both
physically
and
morally
and
it
seems
you
have
taken
care
to
cause
him
as
much
moral
suffering
as
possible
may
i
see
the
count
pierre
repeated
hmif
you
want
to
kill
him
to
kill
him
outright
you
may
see
him
olga
go
and
see
whether
uncles
bouillon
is
ready
its
soon
time
she
added
thereby
showing
pierre
that
they
were
busy
and
busy
comforting
his
father
while
he
was
obviously
only
busy
upsetting
him
olga
went
out
pierre
stood
looking
at
the
sisters
for
a
while
and
bowing
said
ill
go
to
my
room
then
tell
me
when
i
can
see
him
he
went
out
and
the
ringing
though
not
loud
laughter
of
the
sister
with
the
mole
could
be
heard
behind
him
the
next
day
prince
vassily
came
and
settled
in
the
counts
house
he
summoned
pierre
and
said
to
him
mon
cher
si
vous
vous
conduisez
ici
comme
224
p233tersburg
vous
finirez
tr232s
mal
cest
tout
ce
je
vous
dis
the
count
is
very
very
ill
you
must
not
see
him
at
all
since
then
pierre
had
not
been
disturbed
and
he
spent
whole
days
alone
upstairs
in
his
room
when
boris
came
in
pierre
was
pacing
his
room
stopping
now
and
then
in
the
corners
making
threatening
gestures
to
the
wall
as
if
piercing
the
invisible
enemy
with
a
sword
and
looking
sternly
over
his
spectacles
and
then
starting
his
promenade
again
uttering
vague
words
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
spreading
his
arms
langleterre
a
v233cu
he
said
frowning
and
pointing
his
finger
at
someone
monsieur
pitt
comme
traitre
224
la
nation
et
au
droit
des
gens

224
he
did
not
have
time
to
finish
pitts
sentence
imagining
at
that
moment
that
he
was
napoleon
himself
and
with
his
hero
had
already
carried
out
the
dangerous
crossing
of
the
pas
de
calais
and
conquered
london
before
he
saw
a
young
trim
and
handsome
officer
come
into
his
room
he
stopped
pierre
had
left
boris
a
fourteenyearold
boy
and
had
decidedly
no
recollection
of
him
but
despite
that
with
the
quick
and
cordial
manner
proper
to
him
he
took
his
hand
and
smiled
amiably
do
you
remember
me
boris
said
quietly
with
a
pleasant
smile
ive
come
to
see
the
count
with
my
mother
but
it
seems
hes
not
entirely
well
yes
it
seems
hes
unwell
they
keep
disturbing
him
pierre
replied
trying
to
recall
who
this
young
man
was
boris
felt
that
pierre
did
not
recognize
him
but
he
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
give
his
name
and
not
feeling
the
least
embarrassed
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
count
rostov
invites
you
to
dinner
today
he
said
after
a
rather
long
silence
which
was
awkward
for
pierre
ah
count
rostov
pierre
began
joyfully
so
youre
his
son
ilya
can
you
imagine
i
didnt
recognize
you
at
first
remember
we
used
to
go
to
the
sparrow
hills
with
madame
jacquotlong
ago
you
are
mistaken
boris
said
unhurriedly
with
a
bold
and
slightly
mocking
smile
i
am
boris
the
son
of
princess
anna
mikhailovna
drubetskoy
the
rostov
father
is
called
ilya
the
son
is
nikolai
and
i
never
knew
any
madame
jacquot
pierre
waved
his
hands
and
head
as
if
he
was
being
attacked
by
mosquitoes
or
bees
ah
well
how
about
that
i
got
everything
confused
there
are
so
many
relations
in
moscow
youre
borisyes
so
weve
finally
straightened
it
out
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
boulogne
expedition
wont
the
english
be
in
trouble
if
napoleon
crosses
the
channel
i
think
the
expedition
is
very
important
if
only
villeneuve
doesnt
botch
it
boris
knew
nothing
about
the
boulogne
expedition
he
did
not
read
the
newspapers
and
was
hearing
about
villeneuve
for
the
first
time
here
in
moscow
were
more
taken
up
with
dinners
and
gossip
than
with
politics
he
said
in
his
calm
mocking
tone
i
neither
know
nor
think
about
any
of
it
moscow
is
taken
up
with
gossip
most
of
all
he
went
on
now
the
talk
is
about
you
and
the
count
pierre
smiled
his
kindly
smile
as
if
fearing
that
his
interlocutor
might
say
something
he
would
then
regret
but
boris
spoke
distinctly
clearly
drily
looking
pierre
straight
in
the
eye
moscow
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
gossip
he
went
on
everyones
concerned
about
whom
the
count
will
leave
his
fortune
to
though
maybe
hell
outlive
us
all
which
is
my
heartfelt
wish
yes
its
all
very
painful
pierre
picked
up
very
painful
pierre
kept
fearing
that
this
officer
would
accidentally
fall
into
a
conversation
awkward
for
himself
and
it
must
seem
to
you
boris
said
blushing
slightly
but
without
changing
his
voice
or
pose
it
must
seem
to
you
that
all
everyone
is
concerned
with
is
getting
something
out
of
the
rich
man
here
we
go
thought
pierre
but
i
precisely
wish
to
tell
you
so
as
to
avoid
misunderstandings
that
you
are
greatly
mistaken
if
you
count
my
mother
and
me
among
those
people
were
very
poor
but
i
can
speak
for
myself
at
least
precisely
because
your
father
is
rich
i
dont
consider
myself
his
relation
and
neither
i
nor
my
mother
will
ever
ask
for
or
accept
anything
from
him
pierre
could
not
understand
for
a
long
time
but
when
he
did
he
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
seized
boriss
arm
from
below
with
his
peculiar
quickness
and
awkwardness
and
turning
much
more
red
than
boris
began
speaking
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
shame
and
vexation
how
strange
did
i
everand
who
could
thinki
know
very
well
but
boris
interrupted
him
again
im
glad
ive
spoken
it
all
out
maybe
its
unpleasant
for
you
you
must
excuse
me
he
said
reassuring
pierre
instead
of
being
reassured
by
him
but
i
hope
i
havent
offended
you
i
make
it
a
rule
to
say
everything
directlywhat
shall
i
tell
them
then
will
you
come
to
the
rostovs
for
dinner
and
boris
obviously
relieving
himself
of
a
painful
duty
getting
out
of
an
awkward
situation
himself
and
putting
another
man
in
one
again
became
perfectly
pleasant
no
listen
said
pierre
calming
down
youre
a
surprising
man
what
you
just
said
is
good
very
good
of
course
you
dont
know
me
we
havent
met
for
so
longsince
we
were
childrenyou
may
suppose
that
ii
understand
you
understand
you
very
well
i
wouldnt
have
done
it
i
wouldnt
have
courage
enough
but
its
beautiful
im
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
its
strange
he
added
after
a
pause
and
smiling
what
you
supposed
of
me
he
laughed
well
so
what
well
become
better
acquainted
if
you
please
he
shook
boriss
hand
you
know
i
havent
once
been
to
see
the
count
he
hasnt
sent
for
mei
pity
him
as
a
human
beingbut
what
to
do
and
you
think
napoleon
will
manage
to
send
the
army
across
boris
asked
smiling
pierre
understood
that
boris
wanted
to
change
the
subject
and
agreeing
with
him
began
to
explain
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
boulogne
undertaking
a
lackey
came
to
summon
boris
to
the
princess
the
princess
was
leaving
pierre
promised
to
come
for
dinner
in
order
to
become
closer
with
boris
pressed
his
hand
hard
looked
him
affectionately
in
the
eye
through
his
spectaclesafter
his
departure
pierre
spent
a
long
time
pacing
the
room
no
longer
piercing
the
invisible
enemy
with
his
sword
but
smiling
at
the
memory
of
this
nice
intelligent
and
firm
young
man
as
happens
in
early
youth
and
especially
when
one
is
alone
he
felt
a
gratuitous
tenderness
for
this
young
man
and
promised
himself
to
be
sure
to
become
friends
with
him
prince
vassily
was
seeing
the
princess
off
the
princess
was
holding
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
her
face
was
all
in
tears
its
terrible
terrible
she
was
saying
but
whatever
it
costs
me
i
will
fulfill
my
duty
i
will
come
to
spend
the
night
he
cant
be
left
like
that
every
minute
is
precious
i
dont
understand
why
the
princesses
keep
delaying
maybe
god
will
help
me
find
the
means
to
prepare
himadieu
mon
prince
que
le
bon
dieu
vous
soutienne
adieu
ma
bonne
prince
vassily
replied
turning
away
from
her
ah
hes
in
a
terrible
state
the
mother
said
to
the
son
as
they
were
getting
back
into
the
carriage
he
hardly
recognizes
anyone
i
dont
understand
mama
what
is
his
attitude
towards
pierre
asked
the
son
it
will
all
be
spelled
out
in
the
will
our
fate
too
depends
on
it
but
why
do
you
think
hell
leave
us
anything
ah
my
friend

reason

exclaimed
xiv
when

for
a
long

finally
she
rang

said
crossly
to
the

who
made
her
wait
a
few
minutes

then
ill

another
place
for

miss
the
countess
was
upset
by
her
friends
woes
and
humiliating
poverty
and
was
therefore
out
of
sorts
which
always
expressed
itself
in
her
calling
the
maid

and
miss
beg
pardon
maam
said
the
maid
ask
the
count
to
come
to

the
count

with
a
somewhat
guilty
look
as

and
taking
out
a
cambric
handkerchief
she
began
rubbing

waistcoat
just
a
moment

he
cried
in
a
voice
such

added
noticing
that

and

of
incipient
wrath

you
my
dear
countess
are
a
notorious
spendthrift
said
the
count
and
kissing
his
wifes
hand
he
went
back
to
his
study
when
anna
mikhailovna
came
back
from
bezukhovs
the
money
was
already
lying
before
the
countess
all
in
new
notes
under
a
handkerchief
on
a
little
table
and
anna
mikhailovna
noticed
that
something
was
troubling
the
countess
well
my
friend
asked
the
countess
ah
hes
in
such
a
terrible
state
you
wouldnt
recognize
him
hes
so
poorly
so
poorly
i
stayed
only
a
minute
and
didnt
say
two
words
annette
for
gods
sake
dont
refuse
me
the
countess
said
suddenly
blushing
which
was
quite
strange
with
her
thin
dignified
and
no
longer
young
face
and
taking
the
money
from
under
the
handkerchief
anna
mikhailovna
instantly
realized
what
it
was
about
and
bent
forward
so
as
to
embrace
the
countess
adroitly
at
the
right
moment
this
is
for
boris
from
me
to
have
his
uniform
made
anna
mikhailovna
was
already
embracing
her
and
weeping
the
countess
was
also
weeping
they
wept
because
they
were
friends
and
because
they
were
kind
and
because
they
who
had
been
friends
since
childhood
were
concerned
with
such
a
mean
subjectmoney
and
because
their
youth
was
gonebut
for
both
of
them
they
were
pleasant
tears
xv
countess
rostov
with
her
daughters
and
an
already
large
number
of
guests
was
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
the
count
led
the
male
guests
to
his
study
to
offer
them
his
prize
collection
of
turkish
pipes
from
time
to
time
he
came
out
and
asked
whether
she
had
come
yet
they
were
expecting
marya
dmitrievna
akhrosimov
known
in
society
as
le
terrible
dragon
a
lady
famous
neither
for
her
wealth
nor
for
her
rank
but
for
her
directness
of
mind
and
frank
simplicity
of
manners
marya
dmitrievna
was
known
to
the
tsars
family
was
known
to
all
moscow
and
all
petersburg
and
both
cities
astonished
at
her
chuckled
secretly
at
her
rudeness
and
told
anecdotes
about
her
nevertheless
everyone
without
exception
respected
and
feared
her
in
the
smokefilled
study
the
conversation
turned
to
the
war
which
had
been
declared
in
the
manifesto
and
to
recruitment
no
one
had
read
the
manifesto
yet
but
everyone
knew
of
its
appearance
the
count
sat
on
an
ottoman
between
two
smoking
and
talking
neighbors
the
count
himself
neither
smoked
nor
talked
but
inclining
his
head
now
to
one
side
now
to
the
other
looked
with
obvious
pleasure
at
the
smokers
and
listened
to
the
conversation
of
his
two
neighbors
whom
he
had
set
on
each
other
one
of
the
talkers
was
a
civilian
with
a
wrinkled
bilious
gaunt
and
cleanshaven
face
a
man
approaching
old
age
though
dressed
like
a
most
fashionable
young
man
he
sat
with
his
feet
on
the
ottoman
looking
like
a
familiar
of
the
house
the
amber
bit
deep
in
the
side
of
his
mouth
impetuously
sucking
in
smoke
and
squinting
this
was
the
old
bachelor
shinshin
the
countesss
cousin
a
wicked
tongue
as
the
talk
went
in
moscow
drawing
rooms
he
seemed
to
be
condescending
to
his
interlocutor
the
other
a
fresh
pink
officer
of
the
guards
impeccably
scrubbed
combed
and
buttonedup
held
the
amber
bit
in
the
middle
of
his
mouth
and
drew
the
smoke
in
lightly
with
his
pink
lips
letting
it
out
of
his
handsome
mouth
in
rings
this
was
that
lieutenant
berg
an
officer
of
the
semyonovsky
regiment
with
whom
boris
was
going
off
to
join
the
regiment
and
whom
natasha
teasing
vera
her
older
sister
called
her
fianc233
the
count
sat
between
them
and
listened
attentively
for
the
count
the
most
agreeable
occupation
a
the
game
of
boston
which
he
liked
very
much
was
the
position
of
listener
especially
when
he
managed
to
set
two
garrulous
interlocutors
on
each
other
well
what
then
old
boy
mon

honorable
alphonse

said
shinshin
chuckling
and
combining
which
was
a
peculiarity
of
his
speech
the
simplest
popular
russian
expressions
with
refined
french
phrases
vous

you

no

i
merely
wish
to
prove
sir
that
the
cavalry
is
much
less
profitable
than
the
infantry
now
look
pyotr
nikolaevich
just
consider
my
position
berg
always
spoke
very
precisely
calmly
and
courteously
his
conversation
was
always
concerned
with
himself
alone
he
always
kept
calmly
silent
when
the
talk
was
about
something
that
had
no
direct
relation
to
himself
and
he
could
be
silent
like
that
for
several
hours
without
experiencing
in
himself
or
causing
in
others
the
slightest
embarrassment
but
as
soon
as
the
conversation
concerned
him
personally
he
began
to
speak
expansively
and
with
obvious
pleasure
consider
my
position
pyotr

if
i
were
in
the
cavalry
id
get
no
more
than
two
hundred
roubles
every
four

even
with
the
rank
of
sublieutenant
while
now
i
get
two
hundred
and
thirty
he
said
with
a
joyful
pleasant
smile
looking
at
shinshin
and
the
count
as
though
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
his
success
would
always
constitute
the
chief
goal
of
everyone
elses
desires
besides
that
pyotr

in
transferring
to
the
guards
i
am

berg
went
on
and

are

frequent
then
consider
for
yourself
how
im
able
to
get
along
on
two

yet
i
save
some
and
also
send
some
to

went
on
letting
out
a

comme

said
shinshin
shifting
the
amber
to
the
other
side
of
his
mouth
and
he
winked
at
the
count
the
count
burst
out
laughing
other
guests
seeing
that
shinshin
was
conducting
a
conversation
came
over
to
listen
berg
oblivious
of
both
the
mockery
and
the
indifference
went
on
to
tell
how
he
by
being
transferred
to
the
guards
was
already
one
rank
ahead
of
his
comrades
in
the
corps
how
in
wartime
the
company
commander
might
be
killed
and
he
remaining
the
senior
in
the
company
could
very
easily
become
the
commander
and
how
everyone
in
the
regiment
liked
him
and
how
his
papa
was
pleased
with
him
berg
apparently
enjoyed
telling
about
it
all
and
seemed
not
to
suspect
that
other
people
might
also
have
their
interests
but
everything
he
told
about
was
so
nice
so
earnest
the
na239vet233
of
his
youthful
egoism
was
so
obvious
that
his
listeners
were
disarmed
well
old

or

youll
make
it
anywhere
that
i
prophesy

you
said
shinshin
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
and
lowering
his
feet
from
the
ottoman
berg
smiled
joyfully
the
count
and
his
guests
after
him
went
to
the
drawing
room
it
was
that
time
before
a
formal
dinner
when
the
assembled
guests
refrain
from
beginning
a
long
conversation
expecting
to
be
called
to
the
hors
doeuvres
but
at
the
same
time
consider
it
necessary
to
move
about
and
not
be
silent
in
order
to
show
that
they
are
not
at
all
impatient
to
sit
down
at
the
table
the
hosts
keep
glancing
at
the
door
and
occasionally
exchange
glances
with
each
other
the
guests
try
to
guess
from
these
glances
who
or
what
they
are
still
waiting
for
an
important
belated
relation
or
a
dish
that
is
not
ready
yet
pierre
arrived
just
before
dinner
and
sat
awkwardly
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
in
the
first
armchair
he
happened
upon
getting
in
everyones
way
the
countess
wanted
to
get
him
to
talk
but
he
looked
around
na239vely
through
his
spectacles
as
if
searching
for
someone
and
gave
monosyllabic
answers
to
all
the
countesss
questions
he
was
an
inconvenience
and
was
the
only
one
not
to
notice
it
the
majority
of
the
guests
knowing
his
story
with
the
bear
looked
curiously
at
this
big
fat
and
placid
man
wondering
how
such
a
clumsy
and
shy
fellow
could
perform
such
a
stunt
with
a
policeman
did
you
arrive
recently
the
countess
asked
him
oui
madame
he
replied
looking
around
have
you
seen
my
husband
non
madame
he
smiled
quite
inappropriately
it
seems
you
were
recently
in
paris
i
suppose
it
was
very
interesting
very
interesting
the
countess
exchanged
glances
with
anna
mikhailovna
anna
mikhailovna
understood
that
she
was
being
asked
to
take
up
this
young
man
and
sitting
beside
him
she
began
speaking
of
his
father
but
as
with
the
countess
he
gave
her
nothing
but
monosyllabic
answers
the
guests
were
all
taken
up
with
each
other

marya

her
voice
was
heard
from

herself
a
rough
female
voice
was
heard
in

after
which

came
into

all
the

and
even
the

marya

in

doorway
and
from
the
height
of
her
corpulent
body
her
fiftyyearold
head
with
its
gray
curled
hair
held
high
looked
over
the
guests
and
unhurriedly
straightened
the
wide
sleeves
of
her
dress
as
if
pushing
them
up
marya
dmitrievna
always
spoke
in
russian
congratulations
to
the
dear

lady
and
her

she
said
in
her
loud
dense
voice
which
overwhelmed
all
other
noises
and

she
turned
to
the
count

took
from

a

of
pearshaped
ruby
earrings
and
having
given
them
to
the
festively
radiant
and
redcheeked
natasha
turned
away
at
once
and
addressed

she
said
in

quiet
and
high

menacingly
pushed

up

to

to

she
paused
everyone
fell
silent
waiting
for
what
would
happen
and
feeling
that
this
was
only
the
preface

fine
one
to

the
least

and
offered
her
arm
to
the
count

could
barely
keep
from
laughing
well
so

its
to
table
said
marya
dmitrievna
the
count
went
first
with
marya
dmitrievna
then
came
the
countess
led
by
a
hussar
colonel
a
useful
man
with
whom
nikolai
was
to
overtake
his
regiment
and
anna

with
shinshin
berg
offered
his
arm
to

the
smiling
julie

went
to
the
table
with
nikolai
after
them
came
other
couples
stretching
the
whole
length
of
the
room
and
behind
them
all
the
children
tutors
and
governesses
came
singly
servants
bustled
about
chairs
scraped
music
began
playing
in
the
gallery
and
the
guests
seated
themselves
the
sounds
of
the
counts
household
music
were
replaced
by
the
sounds
of
knives
and
forks
the
talk
of
the
guests
the
soft
footsteps
of
the
servants
at
the
head
of
the
table
on
one
end
sat
the
countess
to
her
right
marya
dmitrievna
to
her
left
anna
mikhailovna
and
the
other
ladies
at
the
other
end
sat
the
count
to
his
left
the
hussar
colonel
to
his
right
shinshin
and
the
other
male
guests
one
side
of
the
long
table
was
occupied
by
the
older
young
people
vera
sat
next
to
berg
pierre
next
to
boris
on
the
other
side
were
the
children
tutors
and
governesses
from
behind
the
crystal
the
bottles
and
the
bowls
of
fruit
the
count
kept
glancing
at
his
wife
and
her
tall
cap
with
blue
ribbons
and
diligently
poured
wine
for
his
neighbors
not
forgetting
himself
the
countess
too
from
behind
the
pineapples
never
forgetting
her
duties
as
hostess
cast
meaningful
glances
at
her
husband
the
redness
of
whose
face
and
bald
head
it
seemed
to
her
contrasted
sharply
with
his
gray
hair
at
the
ladies
end
a
steady
chatter
went
on
at
the
mens
louder
and
louder
voices
could
be
heard
especially
that
of
the
hussar
colonel
who
ate
and
drank
so
much
growing
redder
and
redder
that
the
count
now
set
him
as
an
example
to
the
other
guests
berg
was
saying
to
vera
with
a
tender
smile
that
love
was
a
heavenly
not
an
earthly
feeling
boris
was
naming
the
guests
at
the
table
for
his
new
friend
pierre
while
exchanging
glances
with
natasha
who
was
sitting
across
from
him
pierre
spoke
little
looked
at
the
new
faces
and
ate
a
lot
starting
with
the
two
soups
of
which
he
chose
224
la
tortue
and
the
savory
pie
and
right
up
to
the
hazel
grouse
he
did
not
skip
a
single
dish
or
a
single
wine
which
the
butler
mysteriously
displayed
for
him
behind
his
neighbors
shoulder
the
bottle
wrapped
in
a
napkin
murmuring
dry
madeira
or
hungarian
or
rhine
wine
of
the
four
crystal
glasses
with
the
counts
monogram
that
stood
before
each
place
he
would
hold
out
the
first
he
happened
upon
and
drank
with
enjoyment
glancing
around
at
the
guests
with
a
more
and
more
pleasant
air
natasha
who
was
sitting
across
from
him
gazed
at
boris
as
a
thirteenyearold
girl
gazes
at
a
boy
she
has
just
kissed
for
the
first
time
and
is
in
love
with
she
occasionally
turned
this
same
gaze
to
pierre
and
under
the
gaze
of
this
funny
lively
girl
he
wanted
to
laugh
himself
without
knowing
why
nikolai
sat
far
away
from
sonya
next
to
julie
karagin
and
again
was
saying
something
to
her
with
an
involuntary
smile
sonya
smiled
formally
but
was
clearly
suffering
from
jealousy
she
turned
pale
then
red
and
tried
as
hard
as
she
could
to
hear
what
nikolai
and
julie
were
saying
to
each
other
the
governess
looked
around
anxiously
as
if
preparing
to
resist
if
anyone
took
it
into
his
head
to
offend
the
children
the
german
tutor
tried
to
memorize
all
the
kinds
of
dishes
desserts
and
wines
in
order
to
describe
everything
in
detail
in
his
letter
to
his
family
in
germany
and
was
quite
offended
that
the
butler
with
the
napkinwrapped
bottle
bypassed
him
the
german
frowned
trying
to
show
by
his
look
that
he
did
not
even
wish
to
have
this
wine
but
was
offended
because
no
one
wanted
to
understand
that
the
wine
was
necessary
for
him
not
in
order
to
quench
his
thirst
nor
out
of
greed
but
out
of
a
conscientious
love
of
knowledge
xvi
at
the
mens
end
of
the
table
the
conversation
was
becoming
more
and
more
animated
the
colonel
said
that
the
manifesto
with
the
declaration
of
war
had
already
been
published
in
petersburg
and
that
a
copy
which
he
had
seen
himself
had
been
delivered
today
by
messenger
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
what
the
deuce
makes
us
go
to
war
with
bonaparte
said

que

the
colonel
was
a
tall
stout
and
sanguine
german
obviously
a
seasoned
soldier
and
a
patriot
he
took
offense
at
shinshins
words
pecause

said
pronouncing
the
b
as
a
p
and
the
d
as
a
t
pecause
the
emperor
knows
that
he
said
in
the
manifesto
that
he
cannot
look
mit
intifference
at
the
tangers
that
threaten
russia
and
that
the
security
of
the
empire
its
tignity
and
the
sacretness
of
its
alliances
he
said
for
some
reason
giving
special
emphasis
to
the
word
alliances
as
if
this
was
the
essence
of
the
matter
and
with
that
impeccable
official
memory
peculiar
to
him
he
repeated
the
introductory
words
of
the
manifesto
and
the
desire
which
constitutes
the
sole
and
absolute
aim
of
the
sovereign
to
establish
peace
in
europe
on
firm
foundations
led
to
his
present
decision
to
move
the
army
abroad
and
to
make
further
efforts
towards
the
achievement
of
that
intention
its
pecause
of
that
my
tear
sir
he
concluded
didactically
drinking
a
glass
of
wine
and
looking
to
the
count
for
encouragement

then

he
especially
drew
out
the

he
concluded
again
addressing
the
count
so

young
man
and

he
added
turning
to
nikolai
who
hearing
that
things
had
got
on
to
the
war
had
abandoned
his
interlocutrice
and
was
looking
all
eyes
and
listening
all
ears
to
the
colonel
i
agree

you
completely
replied
nikolai
blushing
all
over
turning
his
plate
and
rearranging
the
glasses
and
with
such
a
determined
and
desperate
air
as
though
he
was
exposed
right
then
to
great
danger
im
convinced
that
the
russians
must
either
die
or
conquer
he
said
aware
himself
as
the
others
were
once
the
word
had
been
spoken
that
it
was
too
rapturous
and
pompous
for
the
present
occasion
and
therefore
awkward

julie
who

sitting
next

said
with
a
sigh
sonya
trembled
all
over
and
blushed
to
her
ears
behind
her
ears
and
down
her
neck
and
shoulders
as
nikolai
was
speaking
pierre
listened
to
what
the
colonel
said
and
nodded
approvingly

said
a
real
hussar
young
man
cried
the
colonel
pounding
the
table
again

dmitrievnas
bass
voice

suddenly
heard
all
down
the
table

for

the
hussar

the
dense
voice
of
marya
dmitrievna
rang
out
effortlessly
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
thats
so
and
the
conversation
again
became
concentrated
the
ladies
at
their
end
of
the
table
the
mens
at
theirs

dare
ask
said
natashas
little
brother

replied
natasha
her
face
suddenly
flushed
expressing
a
desperate
and
merry
resolve
she
stood
up
her
eyes
inviting
pierre
who
sat
across
from
her
to
listen
and
addressed
her
mother
mama
her
throaty
childs
voice
rang
out
for
the
whole
table
to
hear
what
is
it
the
countess
asked
fearfully
but
seeing
from
her
daughters
face
that
it
was
a
prank
she
sternly
waved
her
hand
at
her
making
a
threatening
and
negative
gesture
with
her
head
the
conversation
hushed
mama
whats
for
dessert
natashas
little
voice
rang
out
still
more
resolutely
without
faltering
the
countess
wanted
to
frown
but
could
not
marya
dmitrievna
shook
her
fat
finger
cossack
she
said
menacingly
most
of
the
guests
looked
at
the
parents
not
knowing
how
to
take
this
escapade

going
to
get
it
said
the
countess
mama
whats

cried
natasha
boldly
now
and
with
capricious
merriment
certain
beforehand
that
her
escapade
would
be
taken
well
sonya
and
fat
petya
hid
their
faces
with
laughter
so
i
dared
natasha
whispered
to
her
little
brother
and
to
pierre
at
whom
she
glanced
again

said
marya
dmitrievna
natasha
saw
there
was
nothing
to
fear
so
she
was
not
afraid
of

she
nearly
shouted
i
want
to
know
marya
dmitrievna
and
the
countess
laughed
and
all
the
guests
followed
suit
everyone
laughed
not
at
marya
dmitrievnas
reply
but
at
the
inconceivable
boldness
and
adroitness
of
this
girl
who
was
both
smart
and
pert
enough
to
treat
marya
dmitrievna
that
way
natasha
left
off
only
when
they
told
her
there
would
be
pineapple
ice
cream
before
the
ice
cream
champagne
was
served
the
music
struck
up
again
the
count
kissed
his
dear
countess
and
the
guests
rising
wished
the
countess
a
happy
name
day
and
clinked
glasses
across
the
table
with
the
count
the
children
and
each
other
again
the
waiters
scurried
about
chairs
scraped
and
the
guests
in
the
same
order
but
with
redder
faces
returned
to
the
drawing
room
and
the
counts
study
xvii
tables
were
set
up
for
boston
parties
were
chosen
and
the
counts
guests
settled
themselves
in
the
two
drawing
rooms
the
sitting
room
and
the
library
the
count
his
cards
spread
in
a
fan
refrained
with
difficulty
from
his
usual
afterdinner
nap
and
laughed
at
everything
the
young
people
at
the
countesss
urging
gathered
around
the
clavichord
and
the
harp
julie
was
the
first
at
everybodys
request
to
play
a
piece
with
variations
for
the
harp
and
along
with
the
other
girls
began
asking
natasha
and
nikolai
known
for
their
musicality
to
sing
something
natasha
who
was
addressed
like
a
grownup
was
obviously
very
proud
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
timid
what
shall
we
sing
she
asked
the
spring
replied
nikolai
well
lets
be
quick
about
it
boris

said
natasha
but
wheres
sonya
she
looked
around
and
seeing
that
her
friend
was
not
in
the
room
ran
to
look
for
her
running
into
sonyas
room
and
not
finding
her
friend
there
natasha
ran
to
the
nurserysonya
was
not
there
either
natasha
realized
that
sonya
was
in
the
corridor
on
the
chest
the
chest
in
the
corridor
was
the
place
of
sorrows
for
the
young
female
generation
of
the
rostov
house
indeed
sonya
in
her
airy
pink
dress
crushing
it
was
lying
face
down
on
the
nannys
dirty
striped
featherbed
on
the
chest
and
covering
her
face
with
her
fingers
was
sobbing
her
bare
little
shoulders
twitching
natashas
face
animated
and
festive
all
day
suddenly
changed
her
eyes
stared
then
her
broad
neck
shuddered
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
drooped
sonya
what
is
itwhat
whats
the
matter
with
you
waaa
and
natasha
spreading
her
big
mouth
and
looking
perfectly
ugly
started
howling
like
a
baby
not
knowing
the
reason
why
only
because
sonya
was
crying
sonya
wanted
to
raise
her
head
and
reply
but
could
not
and
buried
herself
still
more
natasha
wept
sitting
on
the
blue
featherbed
and
embracing
her
friend
gathering
her
forces
sonya
sat
up
and
began
wiping
away
her
tears
and
telling
her
story

sonya
could
not
speak
any
more
and
again
hid
her
head
in
her
hands
and
in
the
featherbed
natasha
began
to
calm
down
but
it
was
clear
from
her
face
that
she
realized
all
the
importance
of
her
friends

said

again
she
burst
out
crying
more
bitterly
than
before
natasha
pulled
her
up

her
and
smiling
through
her
tears
began
to
reassure
her

how
we
and
nikolenka
the
three
of

decided
how
everything

going
to
be
i
dont
remember
how
anymore
but
remember
how
good
and
possible
it
all
was
why
uncle
shinshins

and

just
second
cousins

very
possible

natasha
went
on
saying
so

and
she
kissed
her
laughing
veras
wicked
god

her
but
everything

she
wont

mama
nikolenka

he
never
gave
a
thought
to
julie
and
she
kissed
her
on
the
head
sonya
got
up
the
kitten
revived
its
eyes
sparkled
and
it
seemed
ready
to
raise
its
tail
any
moment
spring
up
on
its
soft
paws
and
play
with
a
ball
of
yarn
as
a
kitten
ought
to
do
do
you
think
so
really
swear
to
god
she
said
quickly
straightening
her
dress
and
hair
really
swear
to
god
replied
natasha
straightening
a
strand
of
stiff
hair
that
had
come
loose
from
her
friends
braid
and
the
two
girls
laughed
so
lets
go
and
sing
the
spring
yes
lets
you
know
that
fat
pierre
who
sat
across
from
me
is
so
funny
natasha
said
suddenly
stopping
i
feel
so
merry
and
natasha
went
running
down
the
corridor
sonya
brushing
off
feathers
and
hiding
the
verses
in
her
bosom
near
her
neck
with
its
protruding
collarbones
her
face
flushed
went
running
after
natasha
with
light
merry
steps
down
the
corridor
to
the
sitting
room
at
the
request
of
the
guests
the
young
people
sang
the
quartet
the
spring
which
everyone
liked
very
much
then
nikolai
sang
a
song
he
had
just
learned
on
a
pleasant
night
beneath
the
moon
how
happy
is
the
reverie
that
in
this
world
there
still
is
one
whose
thoughts
do
ever
turn
to
thee
and
as
her
lovely
hand
which
she
lets
wander
oer
the
harps
bright
strings
plays
in
impassioned
harmony
so
she
to
thee
her
summons
sings
one
day
two
days
then
paradise
but
ah
thy
friend
is
cold
as
ice
and
he
had
not
finished
singing
the
last
words
before
the
young
people
in
the
ballroom
began
preparing
to
dance
and
the
musicians
began
stamping
their
feet
and
coughing
in
the
gallery
pierre
was
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
where
shinshin
knowing
he
had
come
from
abroad
had
started
a
boring
political
conversation
with
him
in
which
other
people
joined
when
the
music
began
to
play
natasha
came
into
the
drawing
room
and
going
straight
up
to
pierre
blushing
and
with
laughing
eyes
said
mama
told
me
to
ask
you
to
dance
im
afraid
ill
confuse
the
figures
said
pierre
but
if
youd
like
to
be
my
teacher
and
lowering
his
fat
arm
he
offered
it
to
the
slender
girl
while
the
couples
were
being
placed
and
the
musicians
were
tuning
up
pierre
sat
with
his
little
partner
natasha
was
perfectly
happy
she
was
dancing
with
a
grownup
who
had
come
from
abroad
she
sat
in
full
view
of
everyone
and
talked
to
him
like
a
grownup
in
her
hand
was
a
fan
which
a
young
lady
had
given
her
to
hold
and
assuming
a
most
worldly
pose
god
knows
where
and
when
she
had
learned
it
fanning
herself
and
smiling
through
the
fan
she
talked
with
her
partner
look
at
her
just
look
at
her
said
the
old
countess
walking
through
the
room
and
pointing
at
natasha
natasha
blushed
and
laughed
well
what
is
it
mama
what
are
you
getting
at
whats
so
surprising
in
the
middle
of
the
third
233cossaise
chairs
began
moving
in
the
drawing
room
where
the
count
and
marya
dmitrievna
were
playing
and
the
greater
the
honored
guests
and
old
folk
stretching
after
sitting
so
long
and
putting
their
wallets
and
purses
in
their
pockets
came
to
the
door
of
the
ballroom
at
their
head
came
marya
dmitrievna
and
the
countboth
with
merry
faces
the
count
with
jocular
politeness
somehow
in
a
balletlike
fashion
offered
his
rounded
arm
to
marya
dmitrievna
he
drew
himself
up
and
his
face
brightened
with
a
special
dashingly
sly
smile
and
as
soon
as
the
last
figures
of
the
233cossaise
came
to
an
end
he
clapped
his
hands
and
called
out
to
the
musicians
in
the
gallery
addressing
the
first
fiddle
semyon
do
you
know
daniel
cooper
that
was
the
counts
favorite
dance
which
he
used
to
dance
while
still
in
his
youth
daniel
cooper
was
in
fact
one
of
the
figures
of
the
anglaise
look
at
papa
natasha
shouted
to
the
whole
ballroom
completely
forgetting
that
she
was
dancing
with
a
grownup
bending
her
curly
head
to
her
knees
and
dissolving
into
her
ringing
laughter
for
the
whole
ballroom
to
hear
indeed
all
who
were
in
the
ballroom
looked
with
smiles
of
joy
at
the
merry
old
man
who
beside
his
stately
partner
marya
dmitrievna
who
was
taller
than
he
rounded
his
arms
shook
them
in
time
to
the
music
squared
his
shoulders
flexed
his
legs
stamped
slightly
and
the
smile
widening
more
and
more
on
his
round
face
prepared
the
spectators
for
what
was
to
come
as
soon
as
the
merry
provocative
sounds
of
daniel
cooper
resembling
a
rollicking
trepak
rang
out
all
the
doors
of
the
ballroom
suddenly
filled
with
the
smiling
faces
of
the
servantsthe
men
on
one
side
the
women
on
the
otherwho
came
to
watch
their
masters
merrymaking
look
at
the
old
dear
an
eagle
the
nanny
said
loudly
from
one
door
the
count
danced
well
and
knew
it
but
his
partner
could
not
and
would
not
dance
well
at
all
her
enormous
body
stood
straight
her
powerful
arms
hung
down
she
had
given
her
reticule
to
the
countess
only
her
stern
but
handsome
face
danced
what
was
expressed
in
the
whole
round
figure
of
the
count
in
marya
dmitrievna
was
expressed
in
her
ever
more
smiling
face
and

the
count
who
got
himself
going
more
and
more
fascinated
his
spectators
by
his
unexpectedly
deft
capers
and
the
light
leaps
of
his
supple
legs
marya
dmitrievna
by
the
slightest
exertion
in
moving
her
shoulders
or
rounding
her
arms
while
turning
or
stamping
produced
no
less
of
an
impression
by
its
merit
which
everyone
appreciated
in
view
of
her
corpulence
and
perpetual
severity
the
dance
became
more
and
more
lively
the
other
couples
could
not
draw
attention
to
themselves
for
a
minute
and
did
not
even
try
to
all

taken
up
with
the

and
marya

natasha
pulled
everyone
present
by
the
sleeve
or
the
dress
demanding
that
they
look
at
papa
though
even
without
that
they
never
took
their
eyes
off
the
dancers

and
shouted
to
the
musicians
to
play
faster
more
and
more
quickly
more
and
more
dashingly
the
count
deployed
himself
now
on
tiptoe
now
on
his
heels
racing
around
marya
dmitrievna
and
finally
returning
his
partner
to
her
seat
he
performed
the
last
step
raising
his
supple
leg
behind
him
bending
down
his
sweating
head
with
its
smiling
face
and
waving
his
rounded
right
arm
amidst
the
thunder
of
applause
and
laughter
especially
from
natasha
the
two
dancers
stopped
breathing
heavily
and
wiping
their
faces
with
cambric
handkerchiefs
thats
how
people
danced
in

pushing

xviii
just
as
the
sixth
anglaise
was
being
danced
in
the
rostovs
ballroom
to
the
sounds
of
the
weary
outoftune
musicians
and
the
weary
servants
and
cooks
were
preparing
supper
count
bezukhov
had
his
sixth
stroke
the
doctors
declared
that
there
was
no
hope
of
recovery
the
sick
man
was
given
a
blank
confession
and
communion
preparations
for
extreme
unction
were
made
and
the
house
was
filled
with
the
bustle
and
anxiety
of
expectation
usual
at
such
moments
outside
the
house
beyond
the
gate
avoiding
the
carriages
that
drove
up
undertakers
crowded
in
anticipation
of
a
rich
order
for
the
counts
funeral
the
commander
in
chief
of
moscow
who
had
constantly
been
sending
adjutants
to
ask
after
the
counts
health
came
in
person
that
evening
to
take
leave
of
catherines
celebrated
courtier
count
bezukhov
the
magnificent
reception
room
was
filled
everyone
rose
deferentially
when
the
commander
in
chief
having
spent
about
half
an
hour
alone
with
the
sick
man
came
out
responding
slightly
to
the
bows
and
trying
to
go
quickly
past
the
looks
that
doctors
clergymen
and
relations
directed
at
him
prince
vassily
grown
thin
and
pale
during
those
days
accompanied
the
commander
in
chief
and
quietly
repeated
something
to
him
several
times
having
seen
the
commander
in
chief
off
prince
vassily
sat
by
himself
on
a
chair
in
the
hall
his
legs
crossed
high
up
his
elbow
resting
on
his
knee
his
hand
over
his
eyes
having
sat
like
that
for
some
time
he
got
up
and
with
unhabitually
hurried
steps
looking
around
with
frightened
eyes
went
down
the
long
corridor
to
the
rear
half
of
the
house
to
the
eldest
princess
those
who
were
in
the
dimly
lit
room
talked
together
in
broken
whispers
and
fell
silent
each
time
turning
with
eyes
full
of
inquiry
and
expectation
to
the
door
which
led
to
the
dying
mans
room
and
which
made
a
faint
noise
whenever
someone
went
in
or
came
out
a
limit
has
been
set
said
a
little
old
man
a
clerical
person
to
a
lady
who
sat
down
beside
him
and
listened
to
him
na239vely
a
limit
has
been
set
to
human
life
which
cannot
be
overstepped
i
wonder
if
its
not
too
late
to
give
extreme
unction
the
lady
asked
adding
his
clerical
title
as
if
she
had
no
opinion
on
the
subject
it
is
a
great
sacrament
my
dear
the
clerical
person
replied
passing
his
hand
over
his
bald
head
which
had
several
strands
of
halfgray
hair
combed
over
it
who
was
that
the
commander
in
chief
himself
someone
asked
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
what
a
youthful
man
hes
in
his
sixties
well
so
they
say
the
count
no
longer
recognizes
anyone
do
they
mean
to
give
him
extreme
unction
i
knew
a
man
who
received
extreme
unction
seven
times
the
second
princess
came
out
of
the
sick
mans
room
with
tearful
eyes
and
sat
down
next
to
dr
lorrain
who
was
sitting
in
a
graceful
pose
under
a
portrait
of
catherine
leaning
his
elbow
on
a
table

in

to

said
the

sighing
so
hes
allowed
to

lorrain
pondered
has

taken

the
doctor
looked
at
his
breguet
take
a
glass
of
boiled
water
and
put
in
une
pinc233e
with
his
slender
fingers
he
showed
what

meant
de

added
in
a
whisper
dere

the
german
said
smiling
everyone
looked
at
the
door
again
it
creaked
and
the
second
princess
having
prepared
the
drink
prescribed
by
lorrain
carried
it
to
the
sick
man
the
german
doctor
went
over
to
lorrain
he
may
still
last
until
tomorrow
morning
the
german
asked
in
poorly
pronounced
french
lorrain
compressing
his
lips
wagged
his
finger
sternly
and
negatively
in
front
of
his
nose
tonight
no
later
he
said
softly
with
a
decent
smile
of
selfsatisfaction
at
being
able
to
clearly
understand
and
explain
the
patients
condition
and
walked
away
meanwhile
prince
vassily
had
opened
the
door
to
the
princesss
room
the
room
was
in
semidarkness
only
two
icon
lamps
burned
before
the
icons
and
there
was
a
good
smell
of
incense
and
flowers
the
whole
room
was
filled
with
small
furniture
little
chiffoniers
cupboards
tables
behind
a
screen
the
white
covers
of
a
high
featherbed
could
be
seen
a
little
dog
barked
ah
its
you
mon
cousin
she
got
up
and
straightened
her
hair
which
was
always
even
now
so
extraordinarily
smooth
that
it
seemed
varnished
and
of
one
piece
with
her
head
what
has
something
happened
she
asked
im
so
frightened
nothing
its
all
the
same
i
have
only
come
to
have
a
talk
with
you
catiche
about
business
said
the
prince
sitting
with
an
air
of
fatigue
in
the
armchair
from
which
she
had
gotten
up
how
warm
you
keep
it
though
he
said
well
sit
down
here
causons
i
thought
something
had
happened
said
the
princess
and
with
her
unchanging
stern
and
stony
expression
she
sat
down
opposite
the
prince
and
prepared
to
listen
i
wanted
to
get
some
sleep
mon
cousin
but
i
cant
well
and
so
my
dear
said
prince
vassily
taking
the
princesss
hand
and
pulling
it
down
as
was
his
habit
it
was
clear
that
this
and
so
referred
to
many
things
they
both
understood
without
naming
them
the
princess
with
her
dry
and
straight
waist
incongruously
long
for
her
legs
looked
straight
and
passionlessly
at
the
prince
with
her
prominent
gray
eyes
she
shook
her
head
and
sighing
turned
to
look
at
the
icons
her
gesture
could
have
been
interpreted
either
as
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
devotion
or
as
an
expression
of
weariness
and
hope
for
a
speedy
repose
prince
vassily
interpreted
this
gesture
as
an
expression
of
weariness
and
do
you
think
its
any
easier
for
me
he
said
je
suis
233reint233
comme
un
cheval
de
poste
but
all
the
same
i
must
talk
with
you
catiche
and
very
seriously
prince
vassily
fell
silent
and
his
cheeks
began
to
twitch
nervously
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
giving
his
face
an
unpleasant
expression
which
never
appeared
on
prince
vassilys
face
when
he
was
in
a
drawing
room
his
eyes
were
also
not
the
same
as
usual
now
they
looked
with
insolent
jocularity
now
they
glanced
around
fearfully
the
princess
holding
the
dog
on
her
lap
with
her
dry
thin
hands
looked
attentively
into
prince
vassilys
eyes
but
it
was
evident
that
she
would
not
break
the
silence
with
a
question
even
if
she
had
to
remain
silent
till
morning
so
you
see
my
dear
princess
and
cousin
katerina
semyonovna
prince
vassily
continued
evidently
getting
himself
to
continue
his
talk
only
after
an
inner
struggle
at
moments
like
this
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
everything
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
the
future
of
youi
love
you
all
like
my
own
children
you
know
that
the
princess
went
on
looking
at
him
just
as
dully
and
fixedly
finally
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
my
family
too
prince
vassily
continued
angrily
pushing
a
little
table
away
and
without
looking
at
her
you
know
catiche
that
you
three
mamontov
sisters
and
my
wife
as
wellwe
are
the
counts
only
direct
heirs
i
know
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
to
speak
and
think
about
such
things
its
no
easier
for
me
but
im
over
fifty
my
friend
i
must
be
ready
for
anything
do
you
know
that
i
have
sent
for
pierre
and
that
the
count
pointing
directly
at
his
portrait
demanded
that
he
come
prince
vassily
looked
questioningly
at
the
princess
but
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
considering
what
he
had
said
to
her
or
was
simply
staring
at
him
theres
one
thing
for
which
i
never
cease
praying
to
god
mon
cousin
she
replied
that
he
have
mercy
on
him
and
grant
that
his
beautiful
soul
peacefully
de
yes
thats
right
prince
vassily
went
on
impatiently
rubbing
his
bald
head
and
angrily
seizing
the
little
table
he
had
pushed
away
and
moving
it
towards
him
again
but
finallyfinally
the
thing
is
as
you
know
yourself
that
last
winter
the
count
wrote
a
will
according
to
which
passing
over
his
direct
heirs
and
us
he
bequeathed
all
his
property
to
pierre
he
has
written
all
sorts
of
wills
the
princess
said
calmly
but
he
cannot
bequeath
anything
to
pierre
pierre
is
illegitimate
but
ma
ch232re
prince
vassily
said
suddenly
clutching
the
little
table
to
him
becoming
animated
and
beginning
to
speak
more
quickly
what
if
a
letter
had
been
written
to
the
sovereign
and
the
count
had
asked
to
adopt
pierre
you
understand
given
the
counts
merits
his
request
would
be
granted
the
princess
smiled
as
people
smile
who
think
they
know
more
about
a
matter
than
those
they
are
talking
with
ill
tell
you
more
prince
vassily
went
on
gripping
her
hand
the
letter
has
been
written
though
not
sent
and
the
sovereign
knows
of
it
the
only
question
is
whether
it
has
been
destroyed
or
not
if
not
then
as
soon
as
its
all
over
prince
vassily
sighed
letting
it
be
understood
what
he
meant
by
the
words
all
over
and
the
counts
papers
are
opened
the
will
and
the
letter
will
be
sent
to
the
sovereign
and
his
request
will
most
likely
be
granted
as
a
legitimate
son
pierre
will
get
everything
and
our
share
asked
the
princess
smiling
ironically
as
if
anything
but
that
could
happen
mais
ma
pauvre
catiche
cest
clair
comme
le
jour
he
alone
is
then
the
legitimate
heir
to
everything
and
you
wont
get
even
this
much
you
must
know
my
dear
whether
the
will
and
the
letter
were
written
and
whether
they
have
been
destroyed
and
if
theyve
been
overlooked
for
some
reason
you
must
know
where
they
are
and
must
find
them
because
thats
all
we
need
the
princess
interrupted
smiling
sardonically
and
without
changing
the
expression
of
her
eyes
im
a
woman
in
your
opinion
were
all
stupid
but
i
know
enough
to
be
sure
that
an
illegitimate
son
cannot
inheritun
b226tard
she
added
supposing
that
this
translation
would
definitively
prove
to
the
prince
his
groundlessness
how
is
it
you
dont
understand
finally
catiche
youre
so
intelligent
how
is
it
you
dont
understand
if
the
count
wrote
a
letter
to
the
sovereign
in
which
he
asked
that
his
son
be
recognized
as
legitimate
it
means
that
pierre
will
no
longer
be
pierre
but
count
bezukhov
and
then
according
to
the
will
hell
get
everything
and
if
the
will
and
the
letter
have
not
been
destroyed
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
you
except
the
consolation
that
you
have
been
virtuous
et
tout
ce
qui
sen
suit
that
is
certain
i
know
that
the
will
has
been
written
but
i
also
know
that
it
is
not
valid
and
you
seem
to
consider
me
a
perfect
fool
mon
cousin
said
the
princess
with
that
expression
with
which
women
speak
when
they
suppose
they
have
said
something
witty
and
insulting
my
dear
princess
katerina
semyonovna
prince
vassily
began
speaking
impatiently
i
have
come
to
you
not
in
order
to
exchange
barbs
but
in
order
to
talk
with
you
as
with
a
kinswoman
a
good
kind
true
kinswoman
about
your
own
interests
i
tell
you
for
the
tenth
time
that
if
the
letter
to
the
sovereign
and
the
will
favoring
pierre
are
among
the
counts
papers
then
my
darling
you
and
your
sisters
do
not
inherit
if
you
dont
believe
me
believe
people
who
know
ive
just
spoken
with
dmitri
onufrich
this
was
the
family
lawyer
and
he
says
the
same
thing
evidently
something
suddenly
changed
in
the
princesss
mind
her
thin
lips
turned
pale
her
eyes
remained
the
same
and
her
voice
when
she
began
to
speak
kept
breaking
into
such
tremors
as
she
evidently
did
not
expect
herself
that
would
be
just
fine
she
said
i
dont
want
anything
and
never
did
she
threw
the
dog
off
her
lap
and
straightened
the
folds
of
her
dress
theres
gratitude
theres
thankfulness
to
people
who
have
sacrificed
everything
for
him
she
said
wonderful
very
fine
i
need
nothing
prince
yes
but
youre
not
alone
you
have
sisters
replied
prince
vassily
but
the
princess
was
not
listening
to
him
yes
ive
long
known
but
i
had
forgotten
that
a
baseness
deceit
envy
intrigue
a
ingratitude
the
blackest
ingratitude
i
could
expect
nothing
in
this
house
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
where
the
will
is
prince
vassily
asked
his
cheeks
twitching
still
more
than
before
yes
i
was
stupid
i
still
believed
in
people
and
loved
them
and
sacrificed
myself
but
only
those
who
are
mean
and
vile
succeed
i
know
whose
intrigue
this
is
the
princess
was
about
to
get
up
but
the
prince
held
her
by
the
arm
the
princess
had
the
air
of
someone
who
has
suddenly
become
disappointed
in
the
whole
human
race
she
looked
spitefully
at
her
interlocutor
theres
still
time
my
friend
remember
catiche
it
was
all
done
inadvertently
in
a
moment
of
wrath
illness
and
then
forgotten
our
duty
my
dear
is
to
correct
his
mistake
to
alleviate
his
last
moments
by
not
allowing
him
to
do
this
injustice
by
not
letting
him
die
thinking
he
has
made
unhappy
those
people
who
those
people
who
sacrificed
everything
for
him
the
princess
picked
up
again
trying
to
rise
but
the
prince
did
not
let
her
something
he
was
never
able
to
appreciate
no
mon
cousin
she
added
with
a
sigh
i
shall
remember
that
one
can
expect
no
reward
in
this
world
that
in
this
world
there
is
neither
honor
nor
justice
one
must
be
cunning
and
wicked
in
this
world
well
voyons

know
your
excellent
heart

i
have
a
wicked
heart

your
heart
the
prince
repeated
i

friendship
and
i
wish

of
the
same
opinion
about
me

and

take
it

the
count

surely
forgotten
about
it
by
now
and
will
want

that
my
only
desire
is

wishes
religiously

the
only
reason
ive

am
here
only
to

winter
she
wormed
her
way
in
here
and
told
the
count
a
whole
heap
of
such
vile
such
nasty
things
about
us
all
especially
sophiei
cant
repeat
itthat
the
count
became
ill
and
didnt
want
to
see

for
two
weeks
i
know
it
was
then
that

nasty

a
great
sin
its
my
hatred
of
that
loathsome
woman
the
princess
nearly
shouted
changing
into
a
competely
different
person
and
why
is
she
worming
her
way
in
here
but
ill
have
it
out
with
her
ill
have
it
all
out
the
time
will
come
xix
while
such
conversations
were
going
on
in
the
reception
room
and
the
princesss
apartments
the
carriage
bringing
pierre
who
had
been
sent
for
and
anna
mikhailovna
who
found
it
necessary
to
go
with
him
was
driving
into
count
bezukhovs
courtyard
as
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
rumbled
softly
over
the
straw
spread
under
the
windows
anna
mikhailovna
turning
to
her
companion
with
words
of
comfort
discovered
that
he
was
asleep
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
woke
him
up
coming
to
his
senses
pierre
followed
anna
mikhailovna
out
of
the
carriage
and
only
then
thought
about
the
meeting
with
his
dying
father
that
lay
ahead
of
him
he
noticed
that
they
had
driven
up
not
to
the
front
but
to
the
back
entrance
just
as
he
was
stepping
out
two
men
in
tradesmans
clothes
hastily
ran
away
from
the
entrance
into
the
shadow
of
the
wall
having
stopped
pierre
made
out
several
more
men
of
the
same
sort
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
on
both
sides
but
neither
anna
mikhailovna
nor
the
footman
nor
the
coachman
who
could
not
help
seeing
these
men
paid
any
attention
to
them
so
that
is
how
it
has
to
be
pierre
decided
to
himself
and
went
after
anna
mikhailovna
anna
mikhailovna
went
up
the
dimly
lit
narrow
stone
stairs
with
hasty
steps
calling
to
pierre
who
lagged
behind
her
and
who
though
he
did
not
understand
why
in
general
he
had
to
go
to
the
count
and
still
less
why
he
had
to
go
by
the
back
stairs
decided
to
himself
judging
by
anna
mikhailovnas
assurance
and
haste
that
this
had
necessarily
to
be
so
halfway
up
the
stairs
they
were
nearly
knocked
off
their
feet
by
some
people
with
buckets
who
came
running
down
the
stairs
stamping
with
their
boots
these
people
pressed
themselves
to
the
wall
to
let
pierre
and
anna
mikhailovna
pass
and
did
not
show
the
least
surprise
when
they
saw
them
is
this
the
way
to
the
princesses
apartments
anna
mikhailovna
asked
one
of
them
yes
the
lackey
answered
in
a
bold
loud
voice
as
though
everything
was
permitted
now
the
door
on
the
left
good
lady
maybe
the
count
didnt
send
for
me
said
pierre
when
he
came
to
the
landing
ill
just
go
to
my
own
rooms
anna
mikhailovna
stopped
so
that
pierre
could
catch
up
with
her
ah
mon
ami
she
said
with
the
same
gesture
as
in
the
morning
when
she
touched
her
sons
arm
croyez
que
je
souffre
autant
que
vous
mais
soyez
homme
really
why
dont
i
go
asked
pierre
looking
at
anna
mikhailovna
affectionately
through
his
spectacles
ah
mon
ami
oubliez
les
torts
quon
a
pu
avoir
envers
vous
pensez
que
cest
votre
p232repeut234tre

she
sighed
je
vous
ai
tout
de
suite
aim233
comme
mon
fils
fiez
224
moi
pierre
je
noublierais
pas
vos
int233r234ts
pierre
understood
none
of
it
he
had
a
still
stronger
impression
that
this
was
how
it
had
to
be
and
he
obediently
followed
anna
mikhailovna
who
was
already
opening
the
door
the
door
led
to
the
backstairs
hallway
in
the
corner
sat
the
princesses
old
servant
knitting
a
sock
pierre
had
never
been
in
this
the
house
he
had
not
even
suspected
the
existence
of
these
rooms
anna
mikhailovna
asked
a
girl
who
walked
past
them
with
a
carafe
on
a
tray
calling
her
dear
and
sweetheart
about
the
princesses
health
and
drew
pierre
further
down
the
stone
corridor
the
first
room
to
the
left
from
the
corridor
led
to
the
princesses
living
quarters
the
maid
with
the
carafe
in
her
haste
everything
was
being
done
in
haste
just
then
in
this
house
did
not
close
the
door
and
as
they
were
passing
by
pierre
and
anna
mikhailovna
involuntarily
glanced
into
the
room
where
the
eldest
princess
and
prince
vassily
were
sitting
close
together
talking
seeing
them
pass
by
prince
vassily
made
an
impatient
movement
and
drew
back
the
princess
jumped
up
and
in
a
desperate
gesture
slammed
the
door
shut
with
all
her
might
this
gesture
was
so
unlike
the
princesss
usual
calm
the
fear
that
showed
on
prince
vassilys
face
was
so
inconsistent
with
his
augustness
that
pierre
stopped
and
looked
at
his
guide
questioningly
through
his
spectacles
anna
mikhailovna
expressed
no
surprise
she
only
smiled
slightly
and
sighed
as
if
to
show
that
she
had
expected
it
all
soyez
homme
mon
ami
cest
moi
qui
veillerai
224
vos
int233r234ts
she
said
in
response
to
his
look
and
went
still
more
quickly
down
the
corridor
pierre
did
not
understand
what
it
was
all
about
and
still
less
what
veiller
224
vos
int233r234ts
meant
but
he
understood
that
it
all
had
to
be
so
from
the
corridor
they
went
into
the
halflit
salon
adjoining
the
counts
anteroom
it
was
one
of
those
cold
and
luxurious
rooms
which
pierre
knew
only
from
the
front
porch
but
in
this
room
too
in
the
middle
of
it
stood
an
empty
tub
and
water
had
been
spilled
on
the
carpet
they
encountered
a
servant
and
an
acolyte
with
a
censer
who
were
walking
on
tiptoe
and
paid
no
attention
to
them
they
went
into
the
anteroom
so
familiar
to
pierre
with
its
two
italian
windows
opening
on
the
winter
garden
a
big
bust
and
a
fulllength
portrait
of
catherine
the
same
people
in
almost
the
same
positions
were
sitting
in
the
anteroom
exchanging
whispers
they
all
fell
silent
and
turned
to
look
at
the
entering
anna
mikhailovna
with
her
pale
weepy
face
and
the
big
fat
pierre
who
with
his
head
hanging
obediently
followed
her
anna
mikhailovnas
face
expressed
an
awareness
that
the
decisive
moment
had
come
with
the
manner
of
a
businesslike
petersburg
lady
she
entered
the
room
still
more
boldly
than
in
the
morning
not
letting
pierre
stray
from
her
she
felt
that
since
she
was
bringing
with
her
the
person
whom
the
dying
man
wished
to
see
her
reception
was
assured
with
a
quick
glance
around
taking
in
everyone
who
was
in
the
room
and
noticing
the
counts
father
confessor
not
really
bending
down
but
suddenly
making
herself
smaller
at
a
quick
amble
glided
over
to
the
father
confessor
and
respectfully
received
a
blessing
first
from
the
one
then
from
the
other
clerical
person
thank
god
were
in
time
she
said
to
the
clerical
person
we
his
relations
were
all
so
afraid
this
young
man
is
the
counts
son
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
a
terrible
moment
having
spoken
these
words
she
went
over
to
the
doctor
cher
docteur
she
said
to
him
ce
jeune
homme
est
le
fils
du
comtey
atil
de
lespoir
the
doctor
was
silent
raising
his
eyes
and
shoulders
with
a
quick
movement
anna
mikhailovna
with
exactly
the
same
movement
raised
her
shoulders
and
eyes
almost
closing
them
sighed
and
walked
away
from
the
doctor
towards
pierre
she
addressed
pierre
with
special
respectfulness
and
tender
sorrow
ayez
confiance
en
sa
mis233ricorde
she
said
to
him
and
pointing
to
a
little
settee
on
which
he
could
sit
and
wait
for
her
made
inaudibly
for
the
door
that
everyone
was
looking
at
and
following
the
barely
audible
noise
of
that
door
disappeared
behind
it
pierre
having
decided
to
obey
his
guide
in
all
things
made
for
the
little
settee
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
as
soon
as
anna
mikhailovna
disappeared
he
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
everyone
in
the
room
turned
to
him
with
something
more
than
curiosity
and
sympathy
he
noticed
that
they
all
exchanged
whispers
indicating
him
with
their
eyes
as
if
with
fear
and
even
obsequiousness
he
was
being
shown
a
respect
no
one
had
ever
shown
him
before
a
lady
unknown
to
him
who
had
been
talking
with
the
clerical
persons
got
up
from
her
place
and
offered
him
a
seat
the
adjutant
picked
up
a
glove
pierre
had
dropped
and
handed
it
to
him
the
doctors
fell
deferentially
silent
when
he
walked
past
them
and
stepped
aside
to
make
way
for
him
pierre
first
wanted
to
sit
somewhere
else
so
as
not
to
inconvenience
the
lady
wanted
to
pick
up
the
glove
himself
and
to
bypass
the
doctors
who
were
not
standing
in
his
way
but
he
suddenly
felt
that
that
would
be
improper
he
felt
that
that
night
he
was
the
person
responsible
for
performing
some
terrible
rite
which
everyone
expected
and
that
he
therefore
had
to
accept
services
from
them
all
he
silently
accepted
the
glove
from
the
adjutant
sat
down
in
the
ladys
place
putting
his
big
hands
on
his
symmetrically
displayed
knees
in
the
na239ve
pose
of
an
egyptian
statue
and
decided
to
himself
that
this
was
precisely
as
it
had
to
be
and
that
that
evening
so
as
not
to
lose
his
head
and
do
something
foolish
he
ought
not
to
act
according
to
his
own
reasoning
but
give
himself
up
entirely
to
the
will
of
those
who
were
guiding
him
two
minutes
had
not
gone
by
before
prince
vassily
in
his
kaftan
with
three
stars
holding
his
head
high
majestically
entered
the
room
he
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
since
morning
his
eyes
were
larger
than
usual
as
he
looked
around
and
saw
pierre
he
went
over
to
him
took
his
hand
something
he
had
never
done
before
and
pulled
it
down
as
if
testing
whether
it
was
well
attached
courage
courage
mon
ami
il
a
demand233
de
vous
voir
cest
bien
and
he
was
about
to
leave
but
pierre
considered
it
necessary
to
ask
how
is
the
health
of
he
hesitated
not
knowing
whether
it
was
proper
to
call
the
dying
man
count
yet
he
was
embarrassed
to
call
him
father
il
a
eu
encore
un
coup
il
y
a
une
demiheure
yet
another
stroke
courage
mon
ami
pierre
was
in
such
a
state
of
mental
confusion
that
at
the
word
stroke
he
pictured
some
sort
of
blow
to
the
body
he
looked
at
prince
vassily
in
perplexity
and
only
then
realized
that
stroke
referred
to
an
illness
prince
vassily
spoke
several
words
to
lorrain
in
passing
and
went
through
the
door
on
tiptoe
he
did
not
know
how
to
walk
on
tiptoe
and
his
whole
body
bobbed
up
and
down
awkwardly
the
elder
princess
went
in
after
him
then
the
clerical
persons
and
the
acolytes
went
in
then
the
servants
also
went
through
the
door
behind
the
door
movement
was
heard
and
finally
with
the
same
face
pale
but
firm
in
the
fulfillment
of
her
duty
anna
mikhailovna
rushed
out
and
touching
pierres
arm
said
la

divine
est
in233puisable
cest
la
c233r233monie

pierre
went
through
the
door
stepping
on
the
soft
carpet
and
noticed
that
the
adjutant
and
the
unknown
lady
and
some
other
servantsall
came
in
after
him
as
if
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
ask
permission
to
enter
that
room
xx
pierre
knew
well
that
big
room
divided
by
columns
and
an
archway
all
hung
with
persian
carpets
the
the
room
behind
the
columns
where
on
one
side
stood
a
high
mahogany
bed
under
a
silk
canopy
and
on
the
other
an
enormous
stand
with
icons
was
brightly
lit
with
red
light
as
is
usual
in
churches
during
evening
services
under
the
shining
casings
of
the
icons
stood
a
long
voltaire
armchair
and
on
the
chair
its
upper
with
snowwhite
unrumpled
apparently
justchanged
pillows
covered
to
the
waist
with
a
bright
green
coverlet
lay
the
majestic
figure
so
familiar
to
pierre
of
his
father
count
bezukhov
with
the
same
mane
of
gray
hair
reminiscent
of
a
lions
above
his
broad
forehead
and
the
same
characteristically
noble
deep
furrows
on
his
handsome
reddishyellow
face
he
lay
directly
under
the
icons
his
two
large
fat
arms
were
freed
of
the
coverlet
and
lay
on
top
of
it
in
his
right
hand
which
lay
palm
down
a
wax
candle
had
been
placed
between
the
thumb
and
the
index
finger
held
in
place
by
an
old
servant
who
reached
from
behind
the
armchair
over
the
armchair
stood
the
clerical
persons
in
their
majestic
shining
vestments
their
long
hair
spread
loose
on
them
lighted
candles
in
their
hands
performing
the
service
with
slow
solemnity
a
little
behind
them
stood
the
two
younger
princesses
holding
handkerchiefs
to
their
eyes
and
in
front
of
them
the
elder
princess
catiche
with
a
spiteful
and
resolute
air
not
taking
her
eyes
off
the
icons
for
a
moment
as
if
telling
everyone
that
she
would
not
answer
for
herself
if
she
glanced
back
anna
mikhailovna
meek
sorrow
and
allforgiveness
on
her
face
and
the
unknown
lady
stood
by
the
door
prince
vassily
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
close
to
the
armchair
behind
a
velvetupholstered
chair
with
its
carved
back
turned
to
him
resting
his
elbow
on
it
holding
a
candle
in
his
left
hand
crossing
himself
with
the
right
raising
his
eyes
each
time
he
put
the
fingers
to
his
forehead
his
face
expressed
calm
piety
and
submission
to
the
will
of
god
if
you
dont
understand
these
feelings
the
worse
for
you
his
face
seemed
to
say
behind
him
stood
the
adjutant
the
doctors
and
the
male
servants
the
men
and
women
were
separated
as
in
church
all
were
silent
crossing
themselves
only
the
church
reading
could
be
heard
the
restrained
bass
singing
and
in
moments
of
silence
sighing
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
anna
mikhailovna
with
a
significant
air
which
showed
that
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
went
all
the
way
across
the
room
to
give
pierre
a
candle
he
lit
it
and
diverted
by
observing
the
others
began
to
cross
himself
with
the
same
hand
in
which
he
was
holding
the
candle
the
youngest
the
redcheeked
and
laughterprone
princess
sophie
with
the
little
mole
looked
at
him
she
smiled
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
did
not
uncover
it
for
a
long
time
but
looking
at
pierre
she
laughed
again
she
evidently
felt
herself
unable
to
look
at
him
without
laughing
but
could
not
keep
from
looking
at
him
and
to
avoid
temptation
slowly
moved
behind
a
column
midway
through
the
service
the
voices
of
the
clergy
suddenly
fell
silent
the
clerical
persons
said
something
to
each
other
in
a
whisper
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
counts
hand
straightened
up
and
turned
to
the
ladies
anna
mikhailovna
stepped
forward
and
bending
over
the
sick
man
beckoned
behind
her
back
for
lorrain
to
come
the
french
doctorwho
stood
without
a
lighted
candle
leaning
on
a
column
in
the
respectful
pose
of
a
foreigner
which
showed
that
despite
differences
of
belief
he
understood
all
the
importance
of
the
rite
being
performed
and
even
approved
of
itwent
over
to
the
sick
man
with
the
inaudible
steps
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
took
up
his
free
hand
from
the
green
coverlet
in
his
white
slender
fingers
and
turning
away
began
taking
his
pulse
and
pondering
the
sick
man
was
given
something
to
drink
there
was
stirring
around
him
then
everyone
went
to
their
places
and
the
service
resumed
during
this
interruption
pierre
noticed
that
prince
vassily
came
from
behind
the
back
of
his
chair
and
with
that
same
look
which
showed
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
so
much
the
worse
for
the
others
if
they
did
not
understand
him
did
not
go
up
to
the
sick
man
but
passing
by
him
joined
the
eldest
princess
and
together
with
her
made
for
the
depths
of
the
bedroom
to
the
high
bed
under
the
silk
canopy
from
the
bed
both
prince
and
princess
disappeared
through
a
rear
door
but
before
the
end
of
the
service
they
came
back
to
their
places
one
after
the
other
pierre
paid
no
more
attention
to
this
circumstance
than
to
all
the
others
having
decided
in
his
mind
once
and
for
all
that
everything
taking
place
before
him
that
evening
had
necessarily
to
be
so
the
sound
of
the
church
singing
ceased
and
the
voice
of
the
clerical
person
was
heard
deferentially
congratulating
the
sick
man
with
having
received
the
sacrament
the
sick
man
went
on
lying
in
the
same
way
lifelessly
and
motionlessly
around
him
everyone
stirred
footsteps
and
whispers
were
heard
among
which
the
whisper
of
anna
mikhailovna
stood
out
more
sharply
than
the
rest
pierre
heard
her
say
he
must
be
transferred
to
his
bed
here
it
will
be
quite
impossible
the
sick
man
was
so
surrounded
by
doctors
princesses
and
servants
that
pierre
could
no
longer
see
the
reddishyellow
head
with
its
gray
mane
which
though
he
did
see
other
faces
had
never
once
left
his
sight
during
the
whole
service
by
the
cautious
movements
of
the
people
standing
around
the
armchair
pierre
guessed
that
the
dying
man
was
being
lifted
up
and
transferred
hold
on
to
my
arm
otherwise
youll
drop
him
the
frightened
whisper
of
one
of
the
servants
reached
him
from
belowone
more
voices
said
and
the
heavy
breathing
and
the
tread
of
peoples
feet
quickened
as
if
the
load
they
were
carrying
was
beyond
their
strength
the
carriers
who
also
included
anna
mikhailovna
came
even
with
the
young
man
and
for
a
moment
over
peoples
backs
and
necks
he
saw
the
high
fleshy
bared
chest
and
massive
shoulders
of
the
sick
man
raised
up
by
the
people
who
held
him
under
the
arms
and
his
curly
gray
leonine
head
that
head
with
its
extraordinarily
wide
brow
and
cheekbones
handsome
sensual
mouth
and
majestic
cold
gaze
was
not
disfigured
by
the
proximity
of
death
it
was
the
same
as
pierre
had
known
it
three
months
earlier
when
the
count
had
seen
him
off
to
petersburg
but
this
head
swayed
helplessly
from
the
uneven
steps
of
the
carriers
and
the
cold
indifferent
gaze
did
not
know
where
to
rest
several
minutes
were
spent
bustling
around
the
high
bed
the
people
who
had
carried
the
sick
man
dispersed
anna
mikhailovna
touched
pierres
arm
and
said
venez
together
with
her
pierre
went
up
to
the
bed
on
which
the
sick
man
had
been
laid
in
a
stately
pose
evidently
having
to
do
with
the
justreceived
sacrament
he
lay
with
his
head
resting
on
the
highly
propped
pillows
his
hands
were
symmetrically
laid
out
palms
down
on
the
green
silk
coverlet
when
pierre
went
up
the
count
looked
straight
at
him
but
looked
with
a
gaze
the
meaning
and
significance
of
which
no
man
could
possibly
understand
either
this
gaze
said
nothing
at
all
except
that
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
one
must
look
somewhere
or
it
said
all
too
much
pierre
stood
there
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
looked
questioningly
at
his
guide
anna
mikhailovna
anna
mikhailovna
made
a
hasty
gesture
with
her
eyes
indicating
the
sick
mans
hand
and
sending
it
an
airborne
kiss
with
her
lips
pierre
diligently
stretching
his
neck
so
as
not
to
snag
the
coverlet
followed
her
advice
and
put
his
lips
to
the
wideboned
and
fleshy
hand
neither
the
hand
nor
a
single
muscle
of
the
counts
face
stirred
pierre
again
looked
questioningly
at
anna
mikhailovna
asking
what
he
was
to
do
now
anna
mikhailovna
pointed
him
with
her
eyes
to
an
armchair
that
stood
by
the
bed
pierre
obediently
began
to
sit
down
in
the
chair
his
eyes
still
asking
whether
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
anna
mikhailovna
nodded
her
head
approvingly
pierre
again
assumed
the
symmetrically
na239ve
pose
of
an
egyptian
statue
evidently
regretting
that
his
clumsy
and
fat
body
took
up
so
much
space
and
applying
all
his
inner
forces
to
making
himself
seem
as
small
as
possible
he
looked
at
the
count
the
count
looked
at
the
same
place
where
pierres
face
had
been
when
he
was
standing
anna
mikhailovnas
face
expressed
an
awareness
of
the
touching
importance
of
this
lastminute
meeting
of
father
and
son
this
went
on
for
two
minutes
which
seemed
like
an
hour
to
pierre
suddenly
a
shuddering
came
over
the
big
muscles
and
furrows
of
the
counts
face
the
shuddering
increased
the
handsome
mouth
became
contorted
only
here
did
pierre
realize
how
close
to
death
his
father
was
a
vague
hoarse
sound
came
from
the
contorted
mouth
anna
mikhailovna
diligently
looked
into
the
sick
mans
eyes
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
pointed
to
pierre
then
to
the
drink
then
in
a
questioning
whisper
named
prince
vassily
then
pointed
to
the
coverlet
the
sick
mans
eyes
and
face
showed
impatience
he
made
an
effort
to
look
at
the
servant
who
never
left
his
post
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
would
like
to
be
turned
on
that
side
whispered
the
servant
and
he
got
up
to
turn
the
counts
heavy
body
face
to
the
wall
pierre
stood
up
to
help
the
servant
as
the
count
was
being
turned
one
of
his
arms
was
left
hanging
helplessly
and
he
made
a
vain
attempt
to
drag
it
over
either
the
count
noticed
the
horror
with
which
pierre
looked
at
this
lifeless
arm
or
some
other
thought
flashed
in
his
dying
head
at
that
moment
but
he
looked
at
the
disobedient
arm
at
the
expression
of
horror
on
pierres
face
at
the
arm
again
and
on
his
face
there
appearedso
incongruous
with
his
featuresa
faint
suffering
smile
as
if
expressing
mockery
at
his
own
strengthlessness
unexpectedly
at
the
sight
of
this
smile
pierre
felt
a
shuddering
in
his
breast
a
tickling
in
his
nose
and
tears
blurred
his
vision
the
sick
man
was
turned
on
his
side
to
the
wall
he
sighed
il
est
assoupi
said
anna
mikhailovna
noticing
the
princess
coming
to
replace
them
allons
pierre
went
out
xxi
there
was
no
one
in
the
reception
room
now
except
prince
vassily
and
the
elder
princess
who
were
sitting
under
the
portrait
of
catherine
having
a
lively
talk
as
soon
as
they
saw
pierre
with
his
guide
they
fell
silent
the
princess
hid
something
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
and
whispered
i
cant
bear
that
woman
catiche
a
fait

prince
vassily
said
to
anna
mikhailovna
allez
ma
pauvre
anna
mikhailovna
prenez
quelque
chose
autrement
vous
ne
suffirez
pas
he
said
nothing
to
pierre
only
squeezed
his
upper
arm
feelingly
pierre
and
anna
mikhailovna
moved
on
to
the
small
drawing
room
il

qui

comme
une
tasse
de
cet
excellent
th233
russe
apr232s
une
nuit
blanche
said
lorrain
with
an
expression
of
restrained
animation
sipping
from
a
fine
china
cup
without
a
handle
standing
in
the
small
round
drawing
room
in
front
of
a
table
on
which
a
tea
service
and
a
cold
supper
had
been
laid
everyone
who
was
in
count
bezukhovs
house
that
night
gathered
around
the
table
to
fortify
themselves
pierre
remembered
very
well
this
small
round
drawing
room
with
its
mirrors
and
little
tables
during
balls
at
the
counts
house
pierre
who
danced
poorly
liked
to
sit
in
this
little
room
of
mirrors
and
watch
how
ladies
in
ball
gowns
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
shoulders
passing
through
this
room
looked
at
themselves
in
the
brightly
lit
mirrors
which
repeated
their
reflections
several
times
now
the
same
room
was
barely
lit
with
two
candles
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
tea
service
and
some
dishes
lay
in
disorder
on
one
of
the
little
tables
and
various
nonfestive
people
exchanging
whispers
were
sitting
in
it
showing
with
each
movement
each
word
that
none
of
them
had
forgotten
what
was
going
on
and
was
yet
to
be
consummated
in
the
bedroom
pierre
did
not
eat
though
he
very
much
wanted
to
he
glanced
questioningly
at
his
guide
and
saw
her
going
out
on
tiptoe
back
to
the
reception
room
where
prince
vassily
had
remained
with
the
elder
princess
pierre
supposed
that
it
had
to
be
so
lingered
a
little
and
followed
her
anna
mikhailovna
was
standing
by
the
princess
and
the
two
women
were
speaking
simultaneously
in
agitated
whispers
allow
me
princess
to
know
what
is
and
what
is
not
necessary
the
younger
woman
was
saying
evidently
in
the
same
agitated
state
she
had
been
in
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
to
her
room
but
my
dear
princess
anna
mikhailovna
was
saying
meekly
and
persuasively
barring
the
way
to
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
princess
from
going
in
wont
it
be
too
hard
on
poor
dear
uncle
at
such
a
moment
when
he
needs
rest
to
talk
about
worldly
things
at
such
a
moment
when
his
soul
is
already
prepared
prince
vassily
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
in
his
casual
pose
one
leg
crossed
high
up
over
the
other
his
cheeks
were
twitching
badly
and
when
they
slackened
seemed
fatter
below
but
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
was
little
taken
up
with
the
conversation
of
the
two
ladies
voyons
ma
bonne
anna
mikhailovna
laissez
faire
catiche
you
know
how
the
count
loves
her
i
dont
even
know
whats
in
this
document
said
the
princess
turning
to
prince
vassily
and
pointing
to
the
inlaid
portfolio
she
was
holding
in
her
hands
i
only
know
that
the
real
will
is
in
his
desk
and
this
is
a
forgotten
document
she
tried
to
go
around
anna
mikhailovna
but
anna
mikhailovna
sprang
over
and
again
barred
her
way
i
know
dear
good
princess
said
anna
mikhailovna
seizing
the
portfolio
with
her
hand
and
so
firmly
that
it
was
clear
she
would
not
soon
let
go
of
it
dear
princess
i
beg
you
i
beseech
you
have
pity
on
him
je
vous
en
conjure
the
princess
said
nothing
all
that
could
be
heard
were
the
sounds
of
the
efforts
of
the
struggle
over
the
portfolio
it
was
clear
that
if
she
did
start
to
talk
it
would
not
be
flattering
for
anna
mikhailovna
anna
mikhailovna
held
on
tight
but
in
spite
of
that
her
voice
retained
all
its
sweet
drawling
softness
pierre
come
here
my
friend
i
think
he
wont
be
out
of
place
in
the
family
councilisnt
that
so
prince
why
are
you
silent
mon
cousin
the
princess
suddenly
shouted
so
loudly
that
the
people
in
the
drawing
room
heard
and
were
frightened
by
her
voice
why
are
you
silent
when
here
god
knows
who
allows
herself
to
interfere
and
make
scenes
on
a
dyings
mans
threshold
intriguer
she
whispered
spitefully
and
tugged
at
the
portfolio
with
all
her
might
but
anna
mikhailovna
went
a
few
steps
so
as
not
to
let
go
of
the
portfolio
and
shifted
her
grip
oh
prince
vassily
said
with
reproach
and
astonishment
he
got
up
cest
ridicule
voyons
let
go
i
tell
you
the
princess
let
go
you
too
anna
mikhailovna
did
not
obey
him

it
all
upon
myself

and
ask

said
anna
mikhailovna
give
him
a
moments
rest
after
such
a
great
sacrament
here
pierre
tell
us
your
opinion
she
turned
to
the
young
man
who
coming
up
close
to
them
looked
with
astonishment
at
the
princesss
spiteful
face
which
had
lost
all
decency
and
at
the
twitching
cheeks
of
prince
vassily
remember
that
you
will
answer
for
all
the
consequences
prince
vassily
said
sternly
you
dont
know
what
youre
doing
loathsome
woman
the
princess
cried
suddenly
falling
upon
anna
mikhailovna
and
tearing
the
portfolio
from
her
prince
vassily
hung
his
head
and
spread
his
hands
at
that
moment
the
door
that
awful
door
at
which
pierre
had
stared
for
so
long
and
which
had
opened
so
softly
now
opened
noisily
banging
against
the
wall
and
the
younger
princess
ran
out
clasping
her
hands
what
are
you
doing
she
said
desperately
il
sen
va
et
vous
me
laissez
seule
the
elder
princess
dropped
the
portfolio
anna
mikhailovna
quickly
bent
down
and
picking
up
the
disputed
object
ran
to
the
bedroom
the
elder
princess
and
prince
vassily
came
to
their
senses
and
followed
her
a
few
minutes
later
the
elder
princess
was
the
first
to
come
out
with
a
pale
and
dry
face
biting
her
lower
lip
at
the
sight
of
pierre
her
face
showed
irrepressible
spite
yes
rejoice
now
she
said
youve
been
waiting
for
this
and
bursting
into
sobs
she
covered
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
and
ran
out
of
the
room
after
the
princess
prince
vassily
came
out
staggering
he
reached
the
sofa
on
which
pierre
was
sitting
and
collapsed
on
it
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hand
pierre
noted
that
he
was
pale
and
his
lower
jaw
was
twitching
and
shaking
as
in
a
fever
ah
my
friend
he
said
taking
pierre
by
the
elbow
and
in
his
voice
there
was
sincerity
and
weakness
such
as
pierre
had
never
noticed
in
him
before
we
sin
so
much
we
deceive
so
much
and
all
for
what
im
over
fifty
my
friendilleverything
ends
in
death
everything
death
is
terrible
he
wept
anna
mikhailovna
was
the
last
to
come
out
she
went
to
pierre
with
quiet
slow
steps
pierre
she
said
pierre
looked
at
her
questioningly
she
kissed
the
young
man
on
the
forehead
wetting
it
with
tears
she
paused
il

pierre
looked
at
her
through
his
spectacles
allons
je
vous

de

rien

comme

larmes
she
led
him
to
the
dark
drawing
room
and
pierre
was
glad
that
nobody
could
see
his
face
anna
mikhailovna
left
him
and
when
she
came
back
he
was
sound
asleep
his
head
resting
on
his
arm
the
next
morning
anna
mikhailovna
said
to
pierre

gazed
at
anna
mikhailovna
blushing
shyly
having
talked
with
pierre
anna
mikhailovna
drove
off
to
the
rostovs
and
went
to
bed
she
woke
up
in
the
morning
and
told
the
rostovs
and
all
her
acquaintances
the
details
of
count
bezukhovs
death
she
said
that
the
count
had
died
as
she
would
like
to
die
that
his
end
had
been
not
only
touching
but
also
instructive
and
the
last
meeting
of
the
father
and
son
had
been
so
touching
that
she
could
not
recall
it
without
tears
and
that
she
did
not
know
who
had
behaved
better
in
those
terrible
moments
the
father
who
remembered
everything
and
everyone
so
well
in
the
last
minutes
and
said
such
touching
things
to
the
son
or
pierre
who
was
a
pity
to
see
he
was
so
crushed
but
who
nevertheless
tried
to
hide
his
sorrow
so
as
not
to
upset
his
dying
father

she
said
she
also
told
disapprovingly
about
the
actions
of
the
princess
and
prince
vassily
but
as
a
great
secret
and
in
a
whisper
xxii
at
bald
hills
the
estate
of
prince
nikolai
andreevich
bolkonsky
the
arrival
of
the
young
prince
andrei
and
the
princess
was
expected
any
day
but
that
expectation
did
not
disrupt
the
harmonious
order
in
which
life
went
on
in
the
old
princes
house
general
in
chief
prince
nikolai
andreevich
known
in
society
as
le
roi
de
prusse
had
been
banished
to
his
country
estate
under
paul
and
had
lived
uninterruptedly
at
bald
hills
ever
since
with
his
daughter
princess
marya
and
her
companion
mlle
bourienne
and
under
the
new
reign
though
he
was
permitted
entry
to
the
capitals
he
went
on
living
uninterruptedly
in
the
country
saying
that
anyone
who
needed
him
could
travel
the
hundred
miles
from
moscow
to
bald
hills
but
that
he
himself
needed
no
one
and
nothing
he
used
to
say
that
there
were
only
two
sources
of
human
vice
idleness
and
superstition
and
that
there
were
only
two
virtues
activity
and
intelligence
he
occupied
himself
personally
with
his
daughters
upbringing
and
to
develop
the
two
chief
virtues
in
her
gave
her
lessons
in
algebra
and
geometry
and
portioned
out
her
whole
life
among
constant
studies
he
himself
was
constantly
occupied
now
with
writing
his
memoirs
now
with
higher
mathematical
calculations
now
with
turning
snuff
boxes
on
a
lathe
now
with
working
in
the
garden
and
supervising
the
construction
work
that
never
ceased
on
his
estate
as
the
main
condition
for
activity
was
order
so
the
order
in
his
way
of
life
was
brought
to
the
utmost
degree
of
precision
his
coming
to
the
table
was
performed
under
the
same
invariable
conditions
and
not
only
at
the
same
hour
but
at
the
same
minute
with
the
people
around
him
from
his
daughter
to
the
servants
the
prince
was
brusque
and
invariably
demanding
and
thus
without
being
cruel
inspired
a
fear
and
respect
for
himself
such
as
the
cruelest
of
men
would
not
find
it
easy
to
obtain
though
he
was
retired
and
now
had
no
importance
in
state
affairs
every
governor
of
the
province
in
which
the
princes
estate
lay
considered
it
his
duty
to
call
on
him
and
like
the
architect
the
gardener
or
princess
marya
to
wait
at
the
appointed
hour
for
the
prince
to
come
out
to
the
highceilinged
waiting
room
and
each
person
in
the
waiting
room
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
respect
and
even
fear
at
the
moment
when
the
immensely
high
door
to
the
study
opened
and
revealed
the
small
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
powdered
wig
with
small
dry
hands
and
gray
beetling
brows
which
sometimes
when
he
frowned
hid
the
brightness
of
his
intelligent
and
youthfully
bright
eyes
on
the
day
of
the
young
couples
arrival
in
the
morning
as
usual
princess
marya
went
into
the
waiting
room
at
the
appointed
hour
for
the
morning
greeting
and
fearfully
crossed
herself
and
inwardly
recited
a
prayer
every
day
she
went
in
and
every
day
she
prayed
that
this
daily
meeting
would
go
well
a
powdered
old
servant
who
was
sitting
in
the
waiting
room
got
up
with
a
quiet
movement
and
in
a
whisper
announced
if
you
please
from
behind
the
door
came
the
regular
sounds
of
a
lathe
the
princess
timidly
pulled
the
easily
and
smoothly
opening
door
and
stopped
in
the
doorway
the
prince
was
working
at
the
lathe
and
having
glanced
at
her
went
on
with
what
he
was
doing
the
immense
study
was
filled
with
things
obviously
in
constant
use
the
big
table
with
books
and
plans
lying
on
it
the
tall
bookcases
with
keys
in
their
glass
doors
the
tall
table
for
writing
in
a
standing
position
on
which
lay
an
open
notebook
the
lathe
with
tools
laid
out
and
wood
shavings
strewn
around
iteverything
spoke
of
constant
diverse
and
orderly
activity
by
the
movements
of
the
small
foot
shod
in
a
silverembroidered
tartar
boot
by
the
firm
pressure
of
the
sinewy
lean
hand
one
could
see
in
the
prince
the
still
persistent
and
muchenduring
strength
of
fresh
old
age
having
made
a
few
more
turns
he
took
his
foot
from
the
pedal
of
the
lathe
wiped
the
chisel
dropped
it
into
a
leather
pouch
attached
to
the
lathe
and
going
to
the
table
called
his
daughter
over
he
never
blessed
his
children
but
offering
her
his
bristly
as
yet
unshaven
cheek
and
giving
her
a
stern
and
at
the
same
time
attentively
tender
look
merely
said
are
you
wellsit
down
then
he
took
the
geometry
notebook
written
in
his
own
hand
and
moved
a
chair
over
with
his
foot
for
tomorrow
he
said
quickly
finding
the
page
and
marking
it
paragraph
by
paragraph
with
his
hard
fingernail
the
princess
bent
to
the
table
over
the
notebook
wait
theres
a
letter
for
you
the
old
man
said
suddenly
taking
an
envelope
with
a
womans
handwriting
on
it
from
a
pouch
attached
to
the
table
and
dropping
it
in
front
of
her
at
the
sight
of
the
letter
the
princesss
face
became
covered
with
red
blotches
she
hastily
took
it
and
bent
over
it
from
h233lo239se
asked
the
prince
baring
his
still
strong
and
yellowish
teeth
in
a
cold
smile
yes
from
julie
said
the
princess
glancing
up
timidily
and
smiling
timidly
ill
skip
two
letters
and
read
the
third
the
prince
said
sternly
im
afraid
you
write
a
lot
of
nonsense
ill
read
the
third
you
can
read
this
one
mon
p232re
the
princess
replied
blushing
still
more
and
handing
him
the
letter
the
third
i
said
the
third
the
prince
shouted
curtly
pushing
the
letter
away
and
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
table
he
drew
the
notebook
with
geometric
drawings
towards
him
well
maam
the
old
man
began
bending
close
to
his
daughter
over
the
notebook
and
putting
one
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
in
which
the
princess
was
sitting
so
that
the
princess
felt
herself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
her
fathers
smell
of
tobacco
and
pungent
old
age
which
she
had
known
so
long
well
maam
these
triangles
are
similar
kindly
look
the
angle
abc
the
princess
glanced
fearfully
at
her
fathers
bright
eyes
so
near
to
her
red
blotches
came
over
her
face
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
so
afraid
that
fear
would
prevent
her
from
understanding
all
of
her
fathers
further
explanations
however
clear
they
were
whether
it
was
the
teacher
or
the
pupil
who
was
at
fault
the
same
thing
repeated
itself
each
day
the
princess
felt
giddy
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
but
only
felt
the
lean
face
of
her
stern
father
near
her
felt
his
breathing
and
his
smell
and
thought
only
of
how
to
get
out
of
the
study
as
quickly
as
possible
and
work
out
the
problem
in
the
freedom
of
her
own
room
the
old
man
would
get
beside
himself
he
would
noisily
move
the
chair
he
was
sitting
in
back
and
forth
try
hard
to
keep
himself
from
flying
into
a
rage
and
almost
always
flew
into
a
rage
poured
out
abuse
and
sometimes
flung
the
notebook
away
the
princess
gave
the
wrong
answer
well
arent
you
a
fool
shouted
the
prince
shoving
the
notebook
away
but
he
got
up
at
once
paced
about
touched
the
princesss
hair
with
his
hands
and
sat
down
again
he
moved
closer
and
continued
his
explanations
it
wont
do
princess
it
wont
do
he
said
when
the
princess
having
taken
and
closed
the
notebook
with
the
next
days
lesson
was
getting
ready
to
leave
mathematics
is
a
great
thing
my
lady
and
i
dont
want

to
be
like

stupid
women
here
much
patience

pleasure
he
patted
her
on
the
cheek
it
will
knock
the
foolishness
out
of
your
head
she
was
about
to
leave
but
he
gestured
for
her
to
stop
and
took
a
new
uncut
book
from
the
tall
table
heres
some
key
to
the
mystery

it
well
off
with
you

you
he
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
himself
princess
marya
went
back
to
her
room
with
the
sad
frightened
expression
which
rarely
left
her
and
made
her
unattractive
sickly
face
still
more
unattractive
and
sat
down
at
her
desk
covered
with
miniature
portraits
and
heaped
with
books
and
notebooks
the
princess
was
as
disorderly
as
her
father
was
orderly
she
put
down
her
geometry
notebook
and
impatiently
unsealed
the
letter
the
letter
was
from
the
princesss
closest
childhood
friend
this
friend
was
that

having
read
that

princess

sighed
and
glanced
into
the
pier
glass
that
stood
to
the
right
of
her
the
mirror
reflected
an
unattractive
weak
body
and
a
thin
face
her
eyes
always
sad
now
looked
into
the
mirror
with
particular
hopelessness
shes
flattering
me
thought
the
princess
and
she
turned
away
and
went
on
reading
julie
however
was
not
flattering
her
friend
indeed
the
princesss
eyes
large
deep
and
luminous
sometimes
it
was
as
if
rays
of
warm
light
came
from
them
in
sheaves
were
so
beautiful
that
very
often
despite
the
unattractiveness
of
the
whole
face
those
eyes
were
more
attractive
than
beauty
but
the
princess
had
never
seen
the
good
expression
of
those
eyes
the
expression
they
had
in
moments
when
she
was
not
thinking
of
herself
as
with
all
people
the
moment
she
looked
in
the
mirror
her
face
assumed
a
strained
unnatural
bad
expression

vous
aime
julie
ps
donnezmoi
des

de
votre
fr232re
et
de
sa
charmante
petite
femme
the
princess
pondered
smiled
pensively
at
which
her
face
lit
up
by
her
luminous
eyes
was
completely
transformed
and
suddenly
getting
up
went
with
her
heavy
step
to
the
desk
she
took
out
some
paper
and
her
hand
quickly
began
moving
across
it
this
is
what
she
wrote
in

ah
si

la

pour

la

bien
triste
pourquoi
me
supposezvous
un

quand
vous
me
parlez
de
votre
affection
pour
le
jeune
homme
sous
ce
rapport
je
ne
suis
rigide
que
pour
moi
je
comprends
ces
sentiments
chez
les
autres
et
si
je
ne
puis
approuver
ne
les
ayant
jamais
ressentis
je
ne
les
condamne
pas
il
me
parait
seulement
que
lamour
chr233tien
lamour
du
prochain
lamour
pour
ses
ennemis
est
plus
m233ritoire
plus
doux
et
plus
beau
que
ne
le
sont
les
sentiments
que
peuvent
inspirer
les

dun

une

the
smiling
mlle
bourienne
spoke
in
a
quick
pleasant
juicy
little
voice
swallowing
her
rs
and
bringing
with
her
into
the
concentrated
sad
and
dreary
atmosphere
of
princess
marya
a
completely
different
frivolously
gay
and
selfcontented
world
princesse

she
added
lowering
her
voice
le

she
said
deliberately
swallowing
her
rs
and
listening
to
herself
with
pleasure

ne
me

de

et
je
ne

fassent
the
princess
glanced
at
her
watch
and
noticing
that
she
was
already
five
minutes
late
for
playing
the
clavichord
went
with
a
frightened
face
to
the
sitting
room
according
to
the
established
order
of
the
day
between
noon
and
two
oclock
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
clavichord
xxiii
the
grayhaired
valet
sat
dozing
and
listening
to
the
princes
snoring
in
the
immense
study
from
the
far
side
of
the
house
from
behind
a
closed
door
came
the
sounds
of
a
dusek
sonata
the
difficult
passages
repeated
twenty
times
just
then
a
carriage
and
a
britzka
drove
up
to
the
porch
and
from
the
carriage
stepped
prince
andrei
who
helped
his
little
wife
out
and
allowed
her
to
go
ahead
grayhaired
tikhon
in
a
wig
stuck
himself
out
the
door
of
the
waiting
room
said
in
a
whisper
that
the
prince
was
sleeping
and
hastily
closed
the
door
tikhon
knew
that
neither
the
sons
arrival
nor
any
sort
of
extraordinary
event
was
to
interrupt
the
order
of
the
day
prince
andrei
evidently
knew
it
as
well
as
tikhon
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
check
whether
his
fathers
habits
had
changed
during
the
time
he
had
not
seen
him
and
verifying
that
they
had
not
turned
to
his
wife
hell
get
up
in
twenty
minutes
lets
go
to
princess
marya
he
said
the
little
princess
had
filled
out
during
this
time
but
her
eyes
and
her
short
lip
with
its
little
mustache
and
smile
rose
as
gaily
and
sweetly
as
ever
when
she
began
to
speak
mais
cest
un
palais
she
said
to
her
husband
looking
around
with
the
expression
of
someone
paying
compliments
to
the
host
at
a
ball
allons
vite
vite
looking
about
she
smiled
at
tikhon
and
at
her
husband
and
at
the
servant
who
accompanied
them
cest
marie
qui
sexerce
allons
doucement
il
faut
la
surprendre
prince
andrei
walked
behind
her
with
a
polite
and
sad
expression
youve
aged
tikhon
he
said
to
the
old
man
who
kissed
his
hand
as
he
passed
before
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
clavichord
came
a
pretty
blonde
frenchwoman
popped
out
of
a
side
door
mlle
bourienne
seemed
wildly
ecstatic
ah
quel
bonheur
pour
la
princesse
she
said
enfin
il
faut
que
je
la
pr233vienne
non
non
de
gr226cevous
234tes
mlle
bourienne
je
vous
connais
d233j224
par
lamiti233
que
vous
porte
ma
bellesoeur
said
the
princess
kissing
her
elle
ne
nous
attend
pas
they
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
through
which
came
the
sounds
of
the
same
passage
repeated
again
and
again
prince
andrei
stopped
and
winced
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
the
princess
went
in
the
passage
broke
off
in
the
middle
a
cry
was
heard
then
the
heavy
footsteps
of
princess
marya
and
the
sounds
of
kissing
when
prince
andrei
went
in
the
two
princesses
who
had
seen
each
other
only
once
for
a
short
time
at
prince
andreis
wedding
were
standing
with
their
arms
around
each
other
their
lips
pressed
hard
to
whatever
place
they
had
happened
upon
in
the
first
moment
mlle
bourienne
was
standing
beside
them
her
hands
pressed
to
her
heart
smiling
piously
apparently
as
ready
to
weep
as
to
laugh
prince
andrei
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
winced
as
music
lovers
wince
when
they
hear
a
false
note
the
two
women
let
go
of
each
other
then
again
as
if
fearing
it
would
be
too
late
seized
each
other
by
the
hands
began
kissing
tore
their
hands
away
and
then
again
began
kissing
each
other
on
the
face
and
quite
unexpectedly
for
prince
andrei
they
both
wept
and
began
to
kiss
again
mlle
bourienne
also
wept
prince
andrei
obviously
felt
awkward
but
for
the
two
women
it
seemed
natural
to
weep
it
seemed
it
had
never
occurred
to
them
that
their
meeting
could
be
otherwise
ah
ch232reah
marie
the
two
women
suddenly
began
to
speak
and
then
laughed
jai
rev233
cette
nuit
vous
ne
nous
attendiez
donc
pas
ah
marie
vous
avez
maigri
et
vous
avez

ne
me

exclaimed
princess
marya
ah
andr233
je
ne
vous
voyais
pas
prince
andrei
and
his
sister
kissed
each
others
hands
and
he
told
her
she
was
the
same
pleurnicheuse
she
had
always
been
princess
marya
turned
to
her
brother
and
through
her
tears
the
loving
warm
and
meek
gaze
of
her
big
luminous
eyes
very
beautiful
at
that
moment
rested
on
prince
andreis
face
the
little
princess
talked
nonstop
her
short
upper
lip
with
its
mustache
would
momentarily
flit
down
touching
where
it
had
to
the
rosy
lower
lip
and
open
up
again
in
a
smile
of
gleaming
teeth
and
eyes
she
told
about
an
incident
that
had
happened
to
her
on
spasskoe
hill
which
was
dangerous
for
her
in
her
condition
and
just
after
that
said
she
had
left
all
her
dresses
in
petersburg
and
would
go
about
here
in
god
knows
what
and
that
andrei
was
quite
changed
and
that
kitty
ordyntsev
had
married
an
old
man
and
that
there
was
a
suitor
for
princess
marya
pour
tout
de
bon
but
well
talk
about
that
later
princess
marya
went
on
silently
looking
at
her
brother
and
there
was
love
and
sadness
in
her
beautiful
eyes
it
was
clear
that
she
had
established
her
own
train
of
thought
independent
of
her
sisterinlaws
talk
in
the
middle
of
her
story
about
the
last
f234te
in
petersburg
she
addressed
her
brother
and
youre
decidedly
going
to
the
war
andr233
she
said
sighing
lise
also
sighed
tomorrow
even
her
brother
answered
il
mabondonne
ici
et
dieu
sait
pourquoi
quand
il
aurait
pu
avoir
de
lavancement
princess
marya
did
not
finish
listening
and
continuing
with
the
thread
of
her
thoughts
turned
to
her
sisterinlaw
her
gentle
eyes
indicating
her
stomach
is
it
certain
she
asked
the
princesss
face
changed
she
sighed
yes
certain
she
said
ah
its
very
frightening
lizas
little
lip
lowered
she
brought
her
face
close
to
her
sisterinlaws
face
and
again
wept
unexpectedly
she
needs
rest
said
prince
andrei
wincing
isnt
it
so
liza
take
her
to
your
rooms
and
ill
go
to
father
how
is
he
the
same
the
same
yes
the
same
i
dont
know
whether
in
your
eyes
the
princess
replied
joyfully
the
same
hours
and
the
strolls
in
the
avenues
the
lathe
asked
prince
andrei
with
a
barely
perceptible
smile
which
showed
that
despite
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
father
he
was
aware
of
his
weaknesses
the
same
hours
and
the
lathe
also
mathematics
and
my
geometry
lessons
princess
marya
replied
joyfully
as
though
her
lessons
in
geometry
were
one
of
the
most
joyful
impressions
of
her
life
when
they
had
waited
out
the
twenty
minutes
until
it
was
time
for
the
old
prince
to
get
up
tikhon
came
to
summon
the
young
prince
to
his
father
in
honor
of
his
sons
arrival
the
old
man
had
made
an
exception
in
his
way
of
life
he
gave
orders
to
allow
him
into
his
the
house
while
he
was
still
dressing
for
dinner
the
prince
held
to
the
old
fashion
of
wearing
a
kaftan
and
powdering
his
hair
and
at
the
moment
when
prince
andrei
not
with
that
peevish
expression
and
manner
he
assumed
in
drawing
rooms
but
with
the
same
animated
face
he
had
when
he
talked
with
pierre
came
to
his
fathers
the
old
man
was
sitting
in
his
dressing
room
on
a
wide
moroccoupholstered
armchair
in
a
powdering
mantle
entrusting
his
head
to
tikhons
hands
ah
the
warrior
so
you
want
to
defeat
bonaparte
said
the
old
man
shaking
his
powdered
head
as
much
as
the
braided
queue
which
was
in
tikhons
hands
would
let
him
at
least
give
him
a
good
drubbing
or
pretty
soon
hell
be
writing
us
down
too
as
his
subjects
greetings
and
he
offered
his
cheek
the
old
man
was
in
high
spirits
following
his
beforedinner
nap
he
used
to
say
that
an
afterdinner
nap
was
silver
but
a
beforedinner
nap
was
gold
he
joyfully
cast
sidelong
glances
at
his
son
from
under
his
thick
beetling
brows
prince
andrei
went
up
and
kissed
his
father
on
the
place
indicated
to
him
he
did
not
respond
to
his

favorite
subjectpoking

at
the
presentday

especially
at

prince
andrei
his
animated
and
respectful
eyes
following
the
movement
of
every
feature
of
his
fathers
face
how

went
on

back
on
his
hobbyhorse
how

germans

this
new
science
of
yours

as

prince
andrei
smiled
let
me
collect
my
wits
papa
he
said
with
a
smile
which
showed
that
his
fathers
weaknesses
did
not
prevent
him
from
loving
and
respecting
him
i
havent

cried
the
old
man
shaking
his
queue
to

whether
it
was
tightly
braided
and
seizing
his
sons
arm

house

he
said
getting
up
from
his
chair
and
pacing
the
room
with
tikhon
running
after
him
and
handing
him
pieces
of
clothing
what
about
sweden
how
will
they
cross
pomerania
seeing
his
fathers
insistent
demand
prince
andrei
reluctantly
at
first
but
then
with
more
and
more
animation
and
inadvertently
switching
from
russian
to
french
out
of
habit
in
the
middle
of
his
discourse
began
to
explain
the
plan
of
operations
for
the
proposed
campaign
he
told
how
a
ninetythousandman
army
was
to
threaten
prussia
so
as
to
draw
her
out
of
neutrality
and
involve
her
in
the
war
how
that
army
was
to
unite
with
the
swedish
army
in
strahlsund
how
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
austrians
united
with
a
hundred
thousand
russians
were
to
go
into
action
in
italy
and
on
the
rhine
and
how
fifty
thousand
russians
and
fifty
thousand
english
would
land
at
naples
and
how
in
all
a
fivehundredthousandstrong
army
was
to
attack
the
french
from
different
sides
the
old
prince
showed
not
the
slightest
interest
during
the
telling
as
though
he
was
not
listening
and
continuing
to
dress
as
he
paced
interrupted
him
three
times
unexpectedly
once
he
stopped
him
and
shouted
the
white
one
the
white
one
this
meant
that
tikhon
had
not
handed
him
the
waistcoat
he
wanted
another
time
he
stopped
asked
and
how
soon
will
she
give
birth
and
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
said
not
good
go
on
go
on
the
third
time
as
prince
andrei
was
finishing
his
description
the
old
man
sang
in
an
old

offkey
voice
malbroug

his

merely
smiled
im

no
worse
than
this
one
well
you
havent
told
me
anything
new
and
the
old
man
muttered
pensively
to
himself
in
a
quick
patter
dieu

go
to
the
dining
room
xxiv
at
the
appointed
hour
powdered
and
cleanshaven
the
prince
came
out
to
the
dining
room
where
he
was
awaited
by
his
daughterinlaw
princess
marya
mlle
bourienne
and
the
princes
architect
who
by
the
princes
strange
caprice
was
admitted
to
the
table
though
by
his
insignificant
position
the
man
could
in
no
way
count
on
such
an
honor
the
prince
who
in
his
life
kept
firmly
to
social
distinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
provincial
officials
to
the
table
suddenly
decided
to
demonstrate
by
means
of
the
architect
mikhail
ivanovich
who
used
to
blow
his
nose
in
the
corner
on
a
checkered
handkerchief
that
all
men
are
equal
and
more
than
once
impressed
it
upon
his
daughter
that
mikhail
ivanovich
was
no
worse
than
you
or
i
at
table
the
prince
most
often
addressed
himself
to
the
wordless
mikhail
ivanovich
in
the
dining
room
immensely
high
like
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
the
princes
entrance
was
awaited
by
the
domestics
and
servants
standing
behind
each
chair
the
butler
a
napkin
over
his
arm
examined
the
place
settings
winking
to
the
lackeys
and
constantly
shifting
his
anxious
gaze
from
the
wall
clock
to
the
door
from
which
the
prince
was
to
appear
prince
andrei
was
looking
at
a
huge
gilded
frame
new
to
him
with
a
picture
of
the
family
tree
of
the
princes
bolkonsky
which
hung
across
the
room
from
an
equally
huge
frame
with
a
poorly
painted
portrait
obviously
from
the
hand
of
a
household
artist
of
a
sovereign
prince
in
a
crown
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
descendant
of
rurik
and
the
first
ancestor
of
the
bolkonsky
family
prince
andrei
looked
at
this
genealogical
tree
shaking
his
head
and
chuckling
with
the
air
of
someone
looking
at
a
portrait
that
is
a
ridiculously
good
likeness
thats
him
all
over
he
said
to
prince
marya
who
came
up
to
him
princess
marya
looked
at
her
brother
in
surprise
she
did
not
understand
what
made
him
smile
everything
her
father
did
evoked
an
awe
in
her
which
was
not
subject
to
discussion
every
man
has
his
achilles
heel
prince
andrei
went
on
with
his
enormous
intelligence
donner
dans
ce
ridicule
princess
marya
could
not
understand
her
brothers
bold
opinions
and
was
getting
ready
to
object
to
him
when
the
awaited
footsteps
were
heard
from
the
study
the
prince
came
in
quickly
gaily
as
he
always
did
as
if
deliberately
contrasting
his
hasty
manners
to
the
strict
order
of
the
house
at
the
same
moment
the
big
clock
struck
two
and
another
in
the
drawing
room
responded
in
a
high
voice
the
prince
stopped
from
under
his
thick
beetling
brows
his
lively
bright
stern
eyes
looked
around
at
everyone
and
rested
on
the
young
princess
the
young
princess
experienced
at
that
moment
the
feeling
courtiers
experience
at
the
appearance
of
the
tsar
that
feeling
of
fear
and
respect
which
this
old
man
evoked
in
all
those
around
him
he
stroked
the
princesss
head
and
then
with
an
awkward
gesture
patted
her
on
the
back
of
the
neck
delighted
delighted
he
said
and
looking
her
intently
in
the
eye
once
again
quickly
stepped
away
and
sat
down
in
his
place
sit
down
sit
down
mikhail
ivanovich
sit
down
he
pointed
his
daughterinlaw
to
the
place
next
to
him
a
servant
pulled
out
the
chair
for
her
ho
ho
said
the
old
man
looking
at
her
rounded
waist
rushing
things
thats
not
good
he
laughed
drily
coldly
unpleasantly
as
he
always
laughedonly
with
his
mouth
not
with
his
eyes
you
must
walk
walk
as
much
as
possible
as
much
as
possible
he
said
the
little
princess
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
want
to
hear
his
words
she
was
silent
and
seemed
embarrassed
the
prince
asked
about
her
father
and
the
princess
began
to
speak
and
smiled
he
asked
her
about
mutual
acquaintances
the
princess
became
still
more
animated
and
started
talking
away
giving
the
prince
greetings
and
town
gossip
la
comtesse
apraksine
la
pauvre
a
perdu
son

et
elle

les

she
said
becoming
more
and
more
animated
as
her
animation
increased
the
prince
looked
at
her
more
and
more
sternly
and
suddenly
as
if
he
had
studied
her
enough
and
arrived
at
a
clear
idea
of
her
turned
away
and
addressed
mikhail
ivanovich
well
now
mikhail
ivanovich
things
are
going
badly
for
our
friend
buonaparte
prince
andrei
he
always
referred
to
his
son
in
the
third
person
like
this
has
just
been
telling
me
what
forces
are
being
prepared
against
him
but
you
and
i
always
considered
him
an
empty
man
mikhail
ivanovich
who
had
no
idea
when
this
you
and
i
had
spoken
such
words
about
bonaparte
but
who
understood
that
he
was
needed
in
order
to
launch
into
the
favorite
subject
looked
at
the
young
prince
in
surprise
not
knowing
what
would
come
of
it
we
have
a
great
tactician
here
the
prince
said
to
his
son
pointing
to
the
architect
and
the
conversation
turned
again
to
the
war
to
bonaparte
and
to
todays
generals
and
statesmen
the
old
prince
seemed
to
be
convinced
not
only
that
all
presentday
men
of
action
were
mere
boys
who
did
not
even
understand
the
abcs
of
military
and
state
affairs
and
that
bonaparte
was
a
worthless
little
frenchman
who
was
successful
only
because
there
were
no
potemkins
and
suvorovs
to
oppose
him
but
he
was
also
convinced
that
there
were
no
political
difficulties
in
europe
nor
was
there
a
war
but
only
some
sort
of
marionette
comedy
that
todays
people
played
at
pretending
they
meant
business
prince
andrei
cheerfully
endured
his
fathers
mockery
of
the
new
people
and
provoked
his
father
to
talk
and
listened
to
him
with
obvious
delight
all
that
there
was
before
seems
good
he
said
but
wasnt
it
that
same
suvorov
who
fell
into
the
trap
set
for
him
by
moreau
and
was
unable
to
get
out
of
it
who
told
you
that
who
told
you
cried
the
prince
suvorov
and
he
flung
away
his
plate
which
was
deftly
caught
by
tikhon
suvorovthink
a
little
prince
andrei
two
men
friedrich
and
suvorovmoreau
moreau
would
have
been
captured
if
suvorov
had
had
a
free
hand
but
he
had
the
hofskriegswurstschnappsrath
on
his
hands
even
the
devil
wouldnt
be
glad
of
that
but
go
and
youll
learn
about
these
hofskriegswurstschnappsraths
suvorov
couldnt
get
on
with
them
how
is
mikhail
kutuzov
going
to
do
it
no
my
friend
he
went
on
you
and
your
generals
wont
get
around
bonaparte
you
need
to
get
hold
of
a
frenchman
so
that
their
own
dont
know
their
own
and
their
own
beat
their
own
they
sent
the
german
pahlen
to
new
york
to
america
to
fetch
the
frenchman
moreau
he
said
alluding
to
the
invitation
made
to
moreau
that
year
to
enter
the
russian
service
wonders
what
were
the
potemkins
the
suvorovs
the
orlovs
germans
no
brother
either
youve
all
lost
your
wits
there
or
mine
have
burnt
out
god
help
you
but
well
see
they
take
bonaparte
for
a
great
general
hm
im
by
no
means
saying
that
all
the
plans
are
good
said
prince
andrei
only
i
cant
understand
how
you
can
make
such
a
judgment
about
bonaparte
laugh
all
you
like
but
bonaparte
is
still
a
great
general
mikhail
ivanovich
the
old
prince
cried
to
the
architect
who
being
busy
with
the
roast
had
hoped
to
be
forgotten
didnt
i
tell
you
bonaparte
was
a
great
tactician
well
he
says
so
too
sure
thing
your
excellency
replied
the
architect
the
prince
again
laughed
his
cold
laugh
bonaparte
was
born
lucky
he
has
excellent
soldiers
and
the
germans
were
the
first
he
attacked
youd
have
to
be
a
donothing
not
to
beat
the
germans
ever
since
the
world
began
everybodys
beaten
the
germans
and
theyve
beaten
nobody
except
each
other
it
was
on
them
he
earned
his
glory
and
the
prince
began
to
analyze
all
the
mistakes
which
to
his
way
of
thinking
bonaparte
had
made
in
all
his
wars
and
even
in
state
affairs
his
son
did
not
object
but
it
was
clear
that
whatever
the
arguments
presented
to
him
he
was
as
little
able
to
change
his
opinion
as
the
old
prince
was
prince
andrei
listened
holding
back
his
objections
and
involuntarily
amazed
at
how
this
old
man
who
had
sat
alone
in
the
country
uninterruptedly
for
so
many
years
could
know
and
discuss
in
such
detail
and
with
such
subtlety
all
the
military
and
political
circumstances
of
europe
in
recent
years
you
think
im
an
old
man
and
dont
understand
the
real
state
of
affairs
he
concluded
but
i
have
it
all
up
here
i
dont
sleep
nights
so
where
has
this
great
general
of
yours
shown
himself
that
would
be
a
long
story
said
his
son
off
with
you
to
your
buonaparte
then

he
shouted

french

dieu
sait
quand

the
prince
sang
offkey
laughed
still
more
offkey
and
left
the
table
all
through
the
argument
and
the
rest
of
dinner
the
little
princess
was
silent
and
kept
glancing
fearfully
now
at
princess
marya
now
at
her
fatherinlaw
when
they
left
the
table
she
took
her
sisterinlaw
by
the
arm
and
led
her
to
another
room

she

ah
hes
so
kind
said
the
princess
xxv
prince
andrei
was
leaving
the
next
evening
the
old
prince
not
abandoning
his
order
went
to
his
rooms
after
dinner
the
little
princess
was
with
her
sisterinlaw
prince
andrei
dressed
in
a
traveling
frock
coat
without
epaulettes
was
packing
with
his
valet
in
the
rooms
assigned
to
him
he
personally
saw
to
the
carriage
and
the
loading
of
the
trunks
and
ordered
the
horses
harnessed
up
all
that
remained
in
the
room
were
the
objects
prince
andrei
always
carried
with
him
a
strongbox
a
big
silver
cellaret
two
turkish
pistols
and
a
sabera
present
from
his
father
brought
back
from
ochakov
all
these
traveling
accessories
prince
andrei
kept
in
great
order
everything
was
new
clean
in
broadcloth
covers
carefully
tied
with
tapes
at
moments
of
departure
and
a
change
of
life
people
capable
of
reflecting
on
their
actions
usually
get
into
a
serious
state
of
mind
at
these
moments
they
usually
take
stock
of
the
past
and
make
plans
for
the
future
prince
andreis
face
was
very
thoughtful
and
tender
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
paced
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
looking
straight
ahead
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
was
he
afraid
of
going
to
the
war
was
he
sad
to
be
leaving
his
wifeperhaps
both
but
evidently
not
wishing
to
be
seen
in
such
a
state
when
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
hallway
he
quickly
unclasped
his
hands
stopped
by
the
table
pretending
to
tie
the
tapes
on
the
strongbox
cover
and
assumed
his
usual
calm
and
impenetrable
expression
they
were
the
heavy
footsteps
of
princess
marya
they
told
me
you
gave
orders
to
harness
up
she
said
breathlessly
she
had
obviously
come
running
and
i
wanted
so
much
to
talk
more
with
you
alone
god
knows
for
how
long
were
parting
again
youre
not
angry
that
ive
come
youve
changed
very
much
andryusha
she
added
as
if
to
explain
her
question
she
smiled
as
she
pronounced
the
name
andryusha
it
must
have
been
strange
to
her
to
think
that
this
stern
handsome
man
was
that
same
andryusha
a
thin
frolicsome
boy
her
childhood
companion
and
where
is
lise
he
asked
only
smiling
in
answer
to
her
question
she
was
so
tired
that
she
fell
asleep
in
my
room
on
the
sofa
ah
andr233
quel
tr233sor
de
femme
vous
avez
she
said
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
opposite
her
brother
shes
a
perfect
child
such
a
dear
merry
child
ive
come
to
love
her
so
prince
andrei
was
silent
but
the
princess
noticed
the
ironic
and
scornful
expression
that
appeared
on
his
face
but
one
must
be
indulgent
towards
little
weaknesseswho
doesnt
have
them
andr233
dont
forget
that
she
grew
up
and
was
formed
in
society
and
then
her
position
now
isnt
very
rosy
one
must
enter
into
each
persons
position
tout
comprendre
cest
tout
pardonner
just
think
how
it
is
for
the
poor
dear
in
her
condition
after
the
life
shes
used
to
to
her
husband
and
remain
alone
in
the
country
its
very
hard
prince
andrei
smiled
looking
at
his
sister
as
we
smile
listening
to
people
whom
we
think
we
can
see
through
you
live
in
the
country
and
you
dont
find
this
life
so
terrible
he
said
im
another
matter
why
talk
of
me
i
do
not
and
cannot
wish
for
any
other
life
because
i
dont
know
any
other
life
but
think
andr233
for
a
young
and
worldly
woman
in
the
best
years
of
her
life
to
be
buried
in
the
country
alone
because
papas
always
busy
and
iyou
know
mehow
poor
i
am
en
ressources
for
a
woman
accustomed
to
the
best
society
mademoiselle
bourienne
alone
i
dislike
her
very
much
your
bourienne
said
prince
andrei
oh
no
shes
a
very
dear
and
kind
and
above
all
a
pitiful
girl
she
has
nobody
nobody
to
tell
the
truth
shes
not
only
unnecessary
to
me
shes
even
an
inconvenience
you
know
ive
always
been
a
wild
creature
and
now
more
than
ever
i
like
being
alonemon
p232re
likes
her
very
much
she
and
mikhail
ivanovich
are
the
two
persons
with
whom
hes
always
gentle
and
kind
because
hes
their
benefactor
as
sterne
says
we
love
people
not
so
much
for
the
good
theyve
done
us
as
for
the
good
weve
done
them
mon
p232re
took
her
as
an
orphan
sur
le
pav233
and
shes
very
kind
and
mon
p232re
likes
her
way
of
reading
she
reads
aloud
to
him
in
the
evenings
she
reads
beautifully
well
but
in
truth
marie
i
wonder
if
fathers
character
isnt
sometimes
hard
on
you
prince
andrei
asked
suddenly
princess
marya
was
first
surprised
then
frightened
by
this
question
on
meon
me
hard
on
me
she
said
hes
always
been
tough
but
now
i
think
hes
becoming
difficult
said
prince
andrei
probably
speaking
so
lightly
of
their
father
on
purpose
to
puzzle
or
test
his
sister
youre
good
in
every
way
andr233
but
you
have
a
sort
of
mental
pride
the
princess
said
following
her
own
train
of
thought
more
than
the
course
of
the
conversation
and
that
is
a
great
sin
is
it
possible
to
judge
ones
father
and
even
if
it
were
possible
what
other
feeling
than
v233n233ration
can
a
man
like
mon
p232re
evoke
and
i
am
so
content
and
happy
with
him
i
only
wish
everyone
could
be
as
happy
as
i
am
her
brother
shook
his
head
mistrustfully
the
one
thing
thats
hard
for
meto
tell
you
the
truth
andr233is
fathers
way
of
thinking
in
the
religious
respect
i
dont
understand
how
a
man
with
such
an
enormous
intellect
cannot
see
what
is
clear
as
day
and
can
be
so
deluded
that
constitutes
my
one
unhappiness
but
here
too
ive
seen
a
shade
of
improvement
recently
his
mockery
recently
hasnt
been
so
biting
and
theres
a
monk
whom
he
received
and
with
whom
he
spoke
for
a
long
time
well
my
friend
im
afraid
you
and
this
monk
are
wasting
your
powder
prince
andrei
said
mockingly
but
affectionately
ah
mon
ami
i
only
pray
to
god
and
hope
he
will
hear
me
andr233
she
said
timidly
after
a
moments
silence
i
have
a
big
request
to
make
of
you
what
is
it
my
friend
no
promise
me
you
wont
refuse
it
wont
be
any
trouble
for
you
and
there
wont
be
anything
in
it
thats
unworthy
of
you
only
youll
comfort
me
promise
andryusha
she
said
putting
her
hand
into
her
reticule
and
taking
hold
of
something
in
it
but
not
showing
it
yet
as
if
what
she
was
holding
constituted
the
object
of
her
request
and
before
she
got
his
promise
to
fulfill
her
request
she
could
not
take
this
something
out
of
her
reticule
she
looked
at
her
brother
with
a
timid
pleading
gaze
even
if
it
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
me
prince
andrei
said
as
if
guessing
what
it
was
about
you
can
think
what
you
like
i
know
youre
the
same
as
mon
p232re
think
what
you
like
but
do
it
for
me
do
it
please
fathers
father
our
grandfather
wore
it
through
all
the
wars
she
still
would
not
take
what
she
was
holding
out
of
the
reticule
so
promise
me
of
course
what
is
it
andr233
im
going
to
bless
you
with
an
icon
and
you
promise
me
never
to
take
it
offdo
you
promise
of
course
if
it
doesnt
weigh
a
hundred
pounds
and
pull
my
neck
downto
give
you
pleasure
said
prince
andrei
but
that
same
second
noticing
the
distressed
look
that
came
to
his
sisters
face
at
this
joke
he
instantly
repented
im
very
glad
truly
very
glad
my
friend
he
added
against
your
will
he
will
save
you
and
have
mercy
on
you
and
turn
you
to
him
because
in
him
alone
there
is
truth
and
peace
she
said
in
a
voice
trembling
from
emotion
with
a
solemn
gesture
holding
up
in
both
hands
before
her
brother
an
old
oval
icon
of
the
savior
with
a
blackened
face
in
a
silver
setting
on
a
finely
wrought
silver
chain
she
crossed
herself
kissed
the
icon
and
gave
it
to
andrei
please
andr233
for
me
from
her
big
eyes
shone
rays
of
a
kindly
and
timid
light
these
eyes
lit
up
her
whole
thin
sickly
face
and
made
it
beautiful
her
brother
wanted
to
take
the
icon
but
she
stopped
him
andrei
understood
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
kissed
the
icon
his
face
was
at
the
same
time
tender
he
was
touched
and
mocking
merci
mon
ami
she
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
they
were
silent
so
as
i
was
saying
to
you
andr233
be
kind
and
magnanimous
as
youve
always
been
dont
judge
lise
too
severely

began

and
her
position
is
very
hard
now
i
dont

anything
to

my
wife
for
anything
or

displeased

her

marya
broke
out
in
red
blotches
and

nothing
as

she
felt
guilty
i
havent
said
anything
to
you
but
it
has
already

said
to
you
and
that

me
sad
the
red
blotches
stood
out
still
more
on
princess
maryas
forehead
neck
and
cheeks
she
wanted
to
say
something
but
could
not
bring
it
out

little
princess

wept
after

said
she

a
foreboding
of
a
bad
delivery
was
afraid
of
it
and
had
complained
about
her
life

this
he
got
up

over
to
his
sister
and
bending
down
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
his
fine
eyes
shone
with
an
intelligent
and
kindly
unhabitual
light
but
he
was
looking
not
at
his
sister
but
into
the
darkness
of
the
open
doorway
over
her
head
lets
go
to
her
i
must
say

on
the
way
to
his

room
in
the
gallery
that
connected
one
house
to
the
other
prince
andrei
met
the
sweetly
smiling
mlle
bourienne
who
three
times
that
day
had
already
run
into
him
with
her
rapturous
and
na239ve
smile
in
secluded
passages
ah
je
vous
croyais
chez
vous
she
said
blushing
and
lowering
her
eyes
for
some
reason
prince
andrei
looked
at
her
sternly
a
spiteful
look
suddenly
came
to
prince
andreis
face
he
said
nothing
to
her
but
avoiding
her
eyes
looked
at
her
forehead
and
hair
with
such
scorn
that
the
frenchwoman
blushed
and
left
without
saying
anything
when
he
approached
his
sisters
room
the
princess
was
already
awake
and
her
merry
little
voice
could
be
heard
through
the
open
door
hurriedly
sending
out
one
word
after
another
she
was
talking
as
if
after
a
long
abstinence
she
wanted
to
make
up
for
lost
time
non

ha

ha
marie
five
times
already
with
other
people
prince
andrei
had
heard
exactly
the
same
phrase
about
the
countess
zubov
and
the
same
laughter
from
his
wife
he
quietly
went
into
the
room
the
princess
round
rosy
with
her
work
in
her
hands
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
and
talking
nonstop
telling
over
her
petersburg
memories
and
even
phrases
prince
andrei
went
to
her
stroked
her
head
and
asked
whether
she
had
rested
from
the
journey
she
made
a
reply
and
went
on
with
the
same
talk
the
coach
and
six
was
standing
at
the
porch
outside
it
was
a
dark
autumn
night
the
coachman
could
not
see
the
shafts
of
the
carriage
on
the
porch
people
with
lanterns
bustled
about
lights
shone
through
the
big
windows
of
the
immense
house
the
domestic
servants
crowded
in
the
front
hall
wishing
to
say
goodbye
to
the
young
prince

the
reception
room
stood
the
whole
household
mikhail
ivanovich
mlle
bourienne
princess
marya
and
the
little
princess

andrei
had
been
summoned
to
his
fathers
study
where
the
old
prince
wanted
to
say
goodbye
to
him
man
to
man
everyone
was
waiting
for
them
to
emerge
when
prince
andrei
went
into
the
study
the
old
prince
in
his
old
mans
spectacles
and
his
white
smock
in
which
he
received
no
one
except
his
son
was
sitting
at
the
table
and
writing
he
looked
up

he
started
writing
again

he
pointed
to
his
cheek

for
not
overstaying
and
clinging
to
a
womans
skirt

and
he
went
on
writing
so
that
spatters
flew
from
his
scratching
pen
if
you
want
to
say
something
speak
i
can
do
the
two
things
at
once
he
added
about
my
wifeim

my
wife
to

accoucheur
so
that
hell

the
old
prince
stopped
and
as
if
unable
to
understand
stared
with
stern
eyes
at
his
son
i
know
no
one
can
help
if
nature
doesnt
help
prince
andrei
said
visibly
embarrassed
i
agree
that
only

case

a
million
ends
badly
but
its
her
and
my
fantasy
people
have
said
things
to
her
shes
had
dreams
and
shes
afraid
hmhm
the
old
prince
said
to
himself
still
writing
ill

it
he
signed
with
a
flourish
suddenly
turned
quickly
to
his
son
and
laughed
a
bad
business
eh

the
old
prince
said
curtly
and
significantly
i

the
prince

anybody
but
you
know
it
yourself
he
seized
his
hand
in
his
bony
little
fist
shook
it
looked
straight
into
his
sons
face
with
his
quick
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
through
a
person
and
again
laughed
his
cold
laugh
the
son
sighed
admitting
by
this
sigh
that
his
father
had
understood
him
the
old
man
continuing
to
fold
and
seal
letters
with
his
habitual
dexterity
kept
snatching
up
and
throwing
down
wax
seal
and
paper
what
can
you
do
shes
beautiful
ill
do
everything
you
can
rest

he
said
brusquely
while
sealing
a
letter
andrei
said
nothing
he
was
both
pleased
and
displeased
that
his
father
understood
him
the
old
man
got
up
and
handed
the
letter
to
his
son

he
said

he
spoke
so
quickly
that
half
the
words
remained
unfinished
but
his
son
was
used
to
understanding
him
he
led
his
son
to
the
desk
opened
the
lid
pulled
out
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
a
notebook
filled
with
his
bold
tall
compact
handwriting

that

no
need

gave

if

voice
but

silent

stood
silently
facing
each
other
the
old
mans
quick
eyes
were
aimed
straight
into
his
sons
eyes
something
twitched
in
the
lower
the
old
princes
face
weve
said

goodbyesoff
with

he
said
suddenly
off
with
you
he
shouted
in
a
loud
and
angry
voice
opening
the
door
of
the
study
what
is
it
whats
wrong
asked
both
princesses
seeing
prince
andrei
and
the
momentarily
emerging
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
white
smock
wigless
and
in
an
old
mans
spectacles
shouting
in
an
angry
voice
prince
andrei
sighed
and
said
nothing
well
he
said
turning
to
his
wife
and
this
well
sounded
like
cold
mockery
as
if
he
had
said
now
perform
your
tricks

the
little
princess
said
turning
pale
and
looking
at
her
husband
in
fear
he
embraced
her
she
cried
out
and
fell
unconscious
on
his
shoulder
he
cautiously
withdrew
the
shoulder
she
was
lying
on
looked
into
her
face
and
carefully
seated
her
in
an
armchair
adieu

he
said
softly
to
his
sister
they
kissed
each
others
hands
and
with
quick
steps
he
walked
out
of
the
room
the

went
on
looking
with
her
beautiful
tearfilled
eyes
at
the
door
through
which
prince
andrei
had
gone
and
making
signs
of
the
cross
at
him
from
the
study
like
gunshots
came
the
oftrepeated
angry
sounds
of
the
old
man
blowing
his
nose
as
soon
as
prince
andrei
left
the
door
to
the
study
quickly
opened
and
the
old

stern

appeared
in

an

slammed

i
in
october
1805
russian
troops
were
occupying
villages
and
towns
in
the
archduchy
of
austria
and
more
new
regiments
kept
arriving
from
russia
to
be
stationed
by
the
fortress
of
braunau
burdening
the
local
inhabitants
with
their
billeting
in
braunau
the
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
had
his
headquarters
on
the
eleventh
of
october
1805
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
just
arrived
in
braunau
had
halted
half
a
mile
from
the
town
waiting
to
be
reviewed
by
the
commander
in
chief
despite
the
nonrussian
locality
and
surroundingsorchards
stone
walls
tile
roofs
mountains
visible
in
the
distanceand
the
nonrussian
folk
gazing
with
curiosity
at
the
soldiers
the
regiment
looked
exactly
the
same
as
any
russian
regiment
waiting
for
review
somewhere
in
central
russia
in
the
evening
of
the
latest
march
an
order
had
been
received
that
the
commander
in
chief
would
review
the
regiment
on
the
march
though
the
wording
of
the
order
seemed
unclear
to
the
regimental
commander
and
the
question
arose
of
how
to
take
the
wording
of
the
orderin
marching
uniform
or
notin
the
council
of
battalion
commanders
it
was
decided
to
present
the
regiment
for
review
in
parade
uniform
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
always
better
to
bow
too
much
than
not
to
bow
enough
and
so
the
soldiers
after
a
twentymile
march
without
a
wink
of
sleep
spent
the
whole
night
mending
and
cleaning
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
calculated
and
counted
off
and
by
morning
the
regiment
instead
of
the
straggling
disorderly
crowd
it
had
been
the
day
before
during
the
latest
march
was
a
wellordered
mass
of
two
thousand
men
each
of
whom
knew
his
place
his
duty
each
of
whose
buttons
and
straps
was
in
its
place
and
sparkling
clean
not
only
were
the
externals
in
good
order
but
if
it
should
please
the
commander
in
chief
to
look
under
the
uniform
he
would
see
on
each
man
the
same
clean
shirt
and
in
each
pack
he
would
find
the
prescribed
number
of
things
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle
as
soldiers
say
there
was
only
one
circumstance
with
regard
to
which
no
one
could
be
at
ease
this
was
footgear
more
than
half
the
men
had
their
boots
falling
to
pieces
but
this
shortcoming
was
not
the
regimental
commanders
fault
since
despite
his
repeated
requests
the
austrian
department
had
not
released
a
supply
and
the
regiment
had
walked
seven
hundred
miles
the
regimental
commander
was
an
elderly
sanguine
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
sidewhiskers
stocky
and
broader
from
chest
to
back
than
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
he
was
wearing
a
brandnew
uniform
with
creases
from
being
packed
away
and
thick
gold
epaulettes
which
seemed
not
to
weigh
down
but
to
lift
up
his
massive
shoulders
the
regimental
commander
had
the
look
of
a
man
happily
performing
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
in
life
he
strolled
about
before
the
front
line
bouncing
at
each
step
as
he
strolled
and
arching
his
back
slightly
it
was
clear
that
the
regimental
commander
admired
his
regiment
was
happy
with
it
and
that
all
his
inner
forces
were
taken
up
only
with
the
regiment
but
in
spite
of
that
his
bouncing
gait
seemed
to
say
that
besides
military
interests
no
small
his
soul
was
taken
up
by
the
interests
of
social
life
and
the
female
sex
well
mikhailo
mitrich
old
boy
he
addressed
one
of
the
battalion
commanders
the
battalion
commander
smiling
moved
forward
it
was
clear
that
both
men
were
happy
we
were
hard
put
to
it
last
night
however
it
seems
the
regiments
not
such
a
bad
oneeh
the
battalion
commander
understood
the
merry
irony
and
laughed
wouldnt
even
be
driven
off
the
tsaritsyn
field
what
just
then
two
horsemen
appeared
on
the
road
from
town
along
which
signalmen
had
been
posted
they
were
an
adjutant
with
a
cossack
riding
behind
him
the
adjutant
had
been
sent
from
headquarters
to
confirm
to
the
regimental
commander
what
had
been
said
unclearly
in
the
previous
days
order
namely
that
the
commander
in
chief
wished
to
see
the
regiment
in
exactly
the
same
condition
it
had
been
in
on
the
marchin
greatcoats
in
dustcovers
and
without
any
preparations
the
day
before
a
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
from
vienna
had
come
to
kutuzov
with
proposals
and
demands
that
he
go
as
quickly
as
possible
to
join
with
the
army
of
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
mack
and
kutuzov
who
did
not
consider
that
juncture
advantageous
intended
among
other
arguments
in
favor
of
his
opinion
to
show
the
austrian
general
the
sorry
condition
in
which
his
troops
arrived
from
russia
it
was
with
that
purpose
that
he
wanted
to
come
and
meet
the
regiment
so
that
the
worse
the
condition
of
the
regiment
was
the
more
pleasing
it
would
be
to
the
commander
in
chief
though
the
adjutant
did
not
know
these
details
he
conveyed
to
the
regimental
commander
the
absolute
demand
of
the
commander
in
chief
that
his
people
be
in
greatcoats
and
dustcovers
and
that
in
the
contrary
case
the
commander
in
chief
would
be
displeased
having
listened
to
these
words
the
regimental
commander
hung
his
head
silently
heaved
his
shoulders
and
spread
his
arms
in
a
sanguine
gesture
now
weve
done
it
he
said
see
i
told
you
mikhailo
mitrich
if
its
on
the
march
then
its
greatcoats
he
turned
reproachfully
to
the
battalion
commander
ah
my
god
he
added
and
resolutely
stepped
forward
company
commanders
he
cried
in
a
voice
accustomed
to
command
sergeant
majorshow
soon
will
he
come
he
turned
to
the
adjutant
with
an
expression
of
deferential
politeness
which
evidently
related
to
the
person
of
whom
he
was
speaking
in
an
hour
i
think
do
we
have
time
to
change
i
dont
know
general
the
regimental
commander
approached
the
ranks
himself
and
gave
orders
to
change
back
into
overcoats
the
company
commanders
ran
to
their
companies
the
sergeant
majors
began
bustling
about
the
overcoats
were
not
in
good
order
and
that
same
instant
the
previously
orderly
silent
rectangles
heaved
stretched
and
began
humming
with
talk
soldiers
ran
back
and
forth
on
all
sides
tossed
their
packs
off
one
shoulder
and
pulled
them
over
their
heads
took
their
overcoats
out
and
raised
their
arms
high
putting
them
into
the
sleeves
half
an
hour
later
everything
was
back
in
its
former
order
only
the
rectangles
had
become
gray
instead
of
black
the
regimental
commander
again
stepped
before
the
regiment
with
his
bouncing
gait
and
looked
it
over
from
a
distance
whats
this
now
whats
this
he
shouted
stopping
commander
of
the
third
company
commander
of
the
third
company
to
the
general
commander
to
the
general
third
company
to
the
commander
voices
were
heard
in
the
ranks
and
an
adjutant
ran
to
look
for
the
belated
officer
when
the
sounds
of
the
zealous
voices
distorting
the
message
and
now
shouting
the
general
to
the
third
company
reached
their
destination
the
summoned
officer
emerged
from
the
back
of
the
ranks
and
though
already
an
elderly
man
and
not
accustomed
to
running
cantered
clumsily
tripping
over
his
toes
towards
the
general
the
captains
face
expressed
the
anxiety
of
a
schoolboy
who
is
asked
to
recite
a
lesson
he
had
not
learned
blotches
appeared
on
his
red
evidently
from
intemperance
face
and
his
mouth
would
not
stay
put
the
regimental
commander
looked
the
captain
up
and
down
as
he
approached
puffing
slackening
his
pace
the
nearer
he
came
soon
youll
have
your
people
dressed
in
sarafans
what
is
that
shouted
the
regimental
commander
thrusting
his
lower
jaw
out
and
pointing
to
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
of
the
third
company
who
was
wearing
a
greatcoat
of
blue
factory
broadcloth
different
from
the
other
greatcoats
where
have
you
been
were
expecting
the
commander
in
chief
and
you
leave
your
post
ehill
teach
you
to
dress
your
people
in
gaudy
colors
for
a
revieweh
the
company
commander
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
superior
officer
pressed
his
two
fingers
more
and
more
firmly
to
his
visor
as
if
he
now
saw
salvation
only
in
this
pressing
well
why
are
you
silent
who
have
you
got
there
dressed
up
like
a
hungarian
the
regimental
commander
joked
sternly
your
excellency

your
excellency

excellency
your
excellency
but
your
excellency
whatnobody
knows
your
excellency
its
dolokhov

the
captain
said
softly

hes
been
reduced

a
field
marshal
is
it
or
to
a
common
soldier
if
its
a
common
soldier
then
he
should
be
dressed
in
the
proper
uniform
like
everybody

gave
him
permission
for

said
the
regimental
commander
cooling
down
a
little
permission
say
something
to
you
and
you
the
regimental
commander
paused
say
something
to
you
and
youwhat
he
said
getting
irritated
again
kindly
dress
your
men
properly
and
having
glanced
at
the
adjutant
the
regimental
commander
walked
with
his
bouncing
gait
towards
the
regiment
it
was
clear
that
he
liked
his
own
irritation
and
that
he
wanted
to
walk
the
length
of
the
regiment
and
find
more
pretexts
for
his
wrath
having
snapped
at
one
officer
for
an
unpolished
insignia
and
another
for
an
unevenness
in
one
rank
he
came
to
the
third
company
hooows
that
youre
standing
wheres
your
leg
wheres
your
leg
the
regimental
commander
shouted
with
an
expression
of
suffering
in
his
voice
still
five
men
away
from
dolokhov
who
was
wearing
a
bluish
greatcoat
dolokhov
slowly
straightened
his
bent
leg
and
looked
the
general
directly
in
the
face
with
his
light
and
insolent
gaze
why

blue
greatcoat

dolokhov
finished
loudly
and
resoundingly
the
eyes
of
the
general
and
the
soldier
met
the
general
said
nothing
angrily
pulling
down
on
his
tight
sash
kindly

i

he
said
walking
away
ii

coming
the
signalman
shouted
just
then
the
regimental
commander
turning
red
ran
to
his
horse
took
the
stirrup
in
his
trembling
hands
threw
his
body
over
straightened
up
drew
his
sword
and
with
a
happy
resolute
face
opening
his
mouth
askew
prepared
to
shout
the
regiment
fluttered
up
briefly
like
a
bird
preening
itself
and
grew
still
tennnhut
shouted
the
regimental
commander
in
a
soulshattering
voice
overjoyed
for
himself
strict
in
regard
to
the
regiment
and
welcoming
in
regard
to
his
approaching
superior
down
the
wide
treelined
unpaved
main
road
rumbling
slightly
on
its
springs
a
high
lightblue
viennese
coachandsix
came
driving
at
a
quick
canter
behind
the
coach
galloped
the
suite
and
a
convoy
of
croats
beside
kutuzov
sat
an
austrian
general
in
a
white
uniform
strange
amidst
the
black
russian
ones
the
coach
drew
up
by
the
regiment
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
general
conversed
quietly
about
something
and
kutuzov
smiled
slightly
at
the
same
time
stepping
down
heavily
from
the
footboard
as
if
these
two
thousand
men
staring
at
him
and
at
the
regimental
commander
with
bated
breath
did
not
exist
a
shout
of
command
rang
out
and
again
the
regiment
quivered
jingling
as
it
presented
arms
in
the
dead
silence
the
weak
voice
of
the
commander
in
chief
was
heard
the
regiment
barked
long
live
your
excellencellencellency
and
again
everything
grew
still
at
first
kutuzov
stood
in
place
while
the
regiment
moved
then
kutuzov
with
the
white
general
beside
him
on
foot
followed
by
his
suite
started
walking
along
the
ranks
by
the
way
the
regimental
commander
saluted
the
commander
in
chief
fastening
his
eyes
on
him
stretching
and
drawing
himself
up
by
the
way
he
walked
along
the
ranks
behind
the
generals
his
body
leaning
forward
barely
controlling
his
bouncing
movement
by
the
way
he
jumped
at
each
word
and
movement
of
the
commander
in
chiefone
could
see
that
he
fulfilled
his
duties
as
a
subordinate
with
still
greater
pleasure
than
his
duties
as
a
superior
owing
to
the
regimental
commanders
strictness
and
zeal
the
regiment
was
in
excellent
condition
compared
with
others
that
had
come
to
braunau
at
the
same
time
the
stragglers
and
sick
amounted
to
only
two
hundred
and
seventeen
men
and
everything
was
in
order
except
the
footgear
kutuzov
walked
along
the
ranks
stopping
every
once
in
a
while
and
saying
a
few
affectionate
words
to
the
officers
he
knew
from
the
turkish
war
and
sometimes
to
soldiers
as
well
looking
at
the
footgear
he
several
times
shook
his
head
sadly
and
pointed
it
out
to
the
austrian
general
with
such
an
expression
as
though
while
not
blaming
anyone
for
it
he
could
not
help
seeing
how
bad
it
was
the
regimental
commander
ran
ahead
each
time
afraid
to
miss
a
word
of
what
the
commander
in
chief
said
about
the
regiment
behind
kutuzov
at
a
distance
from
which
every
faintly
uttered
word
could
be
heard
walked
some
twenty
men
of
his
suite
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
talked
among
themselves
and
occasionally
laughed
closest
behind
the
commander
in
chief
walked
a
handsome
officer
this
was
prince
bolkonsky
beside
him
walked
his
comrade
nesvitsky
a
tall
staff
officer
extremely
fat
with
a
kind
smiling
handsome
face
and
moist
eyes
nesvitsky
could
barely
hold
back
his
laughter
provoked
by
a
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
was
walking
near
him
the
hussar
officer
without
smiling
without
changing
the
expression
of
his
fixed
gaze
was
staring
with
a
serious
face
at
the
regimental
commanders
back
and
mimicking
his
every
movement
each
time
the
regimental
commander
bounced
and
leaned
forward
the
hussar
officer
bounced
and
leaned
forward
in
the
same
in
exactly
the
same
way
nesvitsky
laughed
and
nudged
the
others
urging
them
to
look
at
the
funnyman
kutuzov
walked
slowly
and
indolently
past
the
thousands
of
eyes
that
were
popping
from
their
sockets
following
the
superior
coming
up
to
the
third
company
he
suddenly
stopped
his
suite
not
foreseeing
this
stop
inadvertently
ran
into
him
ah
timokhin
said
the
commander
in
chief
recognizing
the
rednosed
captain
who
had
suffered
on
account
of
the
blue
greatcoat
it
would
seem
impossible
to
draw
oneself
up
more
than
timokhin
had
drawn
himself
up
when
the
regimental
commander
reprimanded
him
but
the
moment
the
commander
in
chief
addressed
him
the
captain
drew
himself
up
so
much
that
it
seemed
if
the
commander
in
chief
were
to
look
at
him
a
little
longer
the
captain
would
be
unable
to
stand
it
and
therefore
kutuzov
evidently
understanding
his
situation
and
wishing
the
captain
on
the
contrary
nothing
but
good
hastened
to
turn
away
a
barely
noticeable
smile
passed
over
kutuzovs
puffy
face
disfigured
by
a
wound
another
izmail
comrade
he
said
a
brave
officer
are
you
pleased
with
him
kutuzov
asked
the
regimental
commander
and
the
regimental
commander
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
invisibly
to
himself
in
the
hussar
officer
bounced
came
forward
and
replied
very
pleased
your
excellency
we
all
have
our
weaknesses
said
kutuzov
smiling
and
moving
away
from
him
his
was
a
devotion
to
bacchus
the
regimental
commander
was
afraid
that
he
might
be
blamed
for
that
and
made
no
reply
just
then
the
officer
noticed
the
face
of
the
captain
with
the
red
nose
and
drawnin
stomach
and
mimicked
his
face
and
pose
so
perfectly
that
nesvitsky
could
not
keep
from
laughing
kutuzov
turned
around
it
was
clear
that
the
officer
could
control
his
face
at
will
the
moment
kutuzov
turned
around
the
officer
managed
to
make
a
scowl
and
then
assume
a
most
serious
deferential
and
innocent
expression
the
third
company
was
the
last
and
kutuzov
fell
to
thinking
evidently
recalling
something
prince
andrei
stepped
from
among
the
suite
and
said
quietly
in
french
you
asked
me
to
remind
you
about
the
demoted
officer
dolokhov
in
this
regiment
wheres
this
dolokhov
asked
kutuzov
dolokhov
now
changed
into
a
gray
soldiers
greatcoat
did
not
wait
to
be
called
out
the
trim
figure
of
the
fairhaired
soldier
with
clear
blue
eyes
stepped
from
the
line
he
went
up
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
presented
arms
a
grievance
kutuzov
asked
frowning
slightly
this
is
dolokhov
said
prince
andrei
ah
said
kutuzov
i
hope
this
lesson
will
set
you
straight
serve
well
our
sovereign
is
merciful
and
i
wont
forget
you
if
you
prove
worthy
the
blue
clear
eyes
looked
at
the
commander
in
chief
just
as
boldly
as
at
the
regimental
commander
as
if
tearing
by
their
expression
the
curtain
of
convention
that
had
so
widely
separated
the
commander
in
chief
from
the
soldier
i
ask
only
one
thing
your
excellency
he
said
in
his
firm
sonorous
unhurried
voice
i
ask
to
be
given
a
chance
to
wipe
out
my
guilt
and
prove
my
devotion
to
the
sovereign
and
to
russia
kutuzov
turned
away
the
same
smile
of
the
eyes
flashed
over
his
face
as
when
he
had
turned
away
from
captain
timokhin
he
turned
away
and
winced
as
if
wishing
to
express
thereby
that
all
that
dolokhov
had
said
to
him
and
all
that
he
could
say
had
long
long
been
known
to
him
that
it
all
bored
him
and
that
it
was
all
by
no
means
what
was
needed
he
turned
away
and
made
for
the
coach
the
regiment
broke
up
into
companies
and
dispersed
to
their
assigned
quarters
not
far
from
braunau
where
they
hoped
to
find
footgear
mend
their
clothes
and
get
some
rest
after
their
hard
marching
dont
hold
it
against
me
prokhor
ignatych
said
the
regimental
commander
circling
around
the
third
company
which
was
moving
to
its
quarters
and
riding
up
to
captain
timokhin
who
was
walking
at
the
head
of
it
the
face
of
the
regimental
commander
after
the
happily
passedoff

irrepressible
joy

the

general
i
wouldnt

replied
the
captain
his
nose
reddening
smiling
and
revealing
with
his
smile
the
absence
of
his
two
front
teeth
knocked
out
by
a
rifle
butt
at
izmail
and
tell
mr
dolokhov
that
i
wont
forget
him
he
should
rest
easy
and
tell
me
please
i
keep
forgetting
to
ask
how

the

your
excellency
said
timokhin
his
smile
letting
it
be
felt
that
he
understood
his
superiors
wishes
well
yes
yes
the
regimental
commander
sought
out
dolokhov
in
the
ranks
and
reined
in
his
horse
with
the
first
actionepaulettes
he
said
to
him
dolokhov
looked
said
nothing
and
did
not
change
the
expression
of
his
mockingly
smiling
mouth
well
thats
fine
the
regimental
commander
went
on
the
men
get
a
glass
of
vodka
each
from
me
he
added
loudly
so
that
the
soldiers
could
hear
im
grateful
to
you
all
thank
god
and
going
ahead
of
the
company
he
rode
to
the
next
one
why
hes
really
a
good
man
you
can
serve
with
him
timokhin
said
to
a
subaltern
officer
who
was
walking
beside
him
all
heart
in
a
word
the
subaltern
officer
said
laughing
the
regimental
commanders
nickname
was
the
king
of
hearts
the
happy
state
of
mind
of
the
officers
after
the
review
passed
itself
on
to
the
soldiers
the
company
walked
along
merrily
on
all
sides
soldiers
voices
exchanged
remarks
how
come
they
said
kutuzov

in
one
eye

slog

more
miles
unfed
it
was
a
pretty
thing
the
way
the
germans
sent
us
carriages
you

riding
along
you
know
its
grand
but
here
brother
the
folk
have
gone
clean
wild
there
it
was
all
some
kind
of
poles
all
under
the
russian
crown
but
now
brother
its
gone
solid
german
singers
up
front
the
captains
shout
was
heard
and
some
twenty
men
from
various
ranks
ran
to
the
front
of
the
company
the
drummer
and
lead
singer
turned
to
face
the
singers
waved
his
arm
and
struck
up
a
drawnout
soldiers
song
that
began
it
was
dawn
the
sun
was
rising
and
ended
with
the
words
and
that
brothers
will
our
glory
be
with
old
man
kamensky
the
song
had
been
composed
in
turkey
and
was
now
being
sung
in
austria
only
with
one
change
that
instead
of
old
man
kamensky
they
put
in
old
man
kutuzov
having
snapped
out
these
last
words
in
soldierly
fashion
and
waved
his
arms
as
if
throwing
something
on
the
ground
the
drummer
a
lean
and
handsome
soldier
of
about
forty
sternly
looked
the
soldiersingers
over
and
narrowed
his
eyes
then
making
sure
that
all
eyes
were
aimed
at
him
he
raised
his
arms
as
if
carefully
lifting
some
invisible
precious
object
over
his
head
held
it
there
for
a
few
seconds
and
all
at
once
desperately
threw
it
down
ah
my
porch
my
new
porch
ah
my
new
porch
twenty
voices
picked
up
and
a
spoon
player
despite
the
weight
of
his
ammunition
nimbly
leaped
out
in
front
and
walked
backwards
facing
the
company
moving
his
shoulders
and
threatening
someone
with
his
spoons
the
soldiers
swung
their
arms
in
time
with
the
song
striding
freely
along
and
involuntarily
keeping
in
step
from
behind
the
company
came
the
sound
of
wheels
the
creaking
springs
and
the
tramping
of
horses
kutuzov
and
his
suite
were
returning
to
town
the
commander
in
chief
gave
a
sign
for
the
men
to
go
on
marching
freely
and
his
face
and
all
the
faces
of
his
suite
expressed
pleasure
at
the
sounds
of
the
song
at
the
sight
of
the
dancing
soldier
and
the
merrily
and
briskly
marching
soldiers
in
the
second
row
of
the
right
flank
where
the
coach
overtook
the
company
the
eye
was
involuntarily
struck
by
the
blueeyed
soldier
dolokhov
who
marched
especially
briskly
and
gracefully
in
time
with
the
song
and
looked
at
the
faces
of
people
passing
by
with
such
an
expression
as
if
he
pitied
all
those
who
were
not
then
marching
with
the
company
the
hussar
cornet
from
kutuzovs
suite
who
had
been
mimicking
the
regimental
commander
dropped
behind
the
coach
and
rode
over
to
dolokhov
the
hussar
cornet
zherkov
had
belonged
for
some
time
to
the
rowdy
company
headed
by
dolokhov
in
petersburg
abroad
zherkov
had
encountered
dolokhov
as
a
soldier
but
had
found
it
unnecessary
to
recognize
him
now
after
kutuzov
had
talked
with
the
demoted
man
he
addressed
him
with
the
joy
of
an
old
friend
friend
of
my
heart
how
are
you
he
said
to
the
sounds
of
the
song
adjusting
the
pace
of
his
horse
to
the
pace
of
the
company
how
am
i
dolokhov
replied
coldly
as
you
see
the
brisk
song
gave
a
special
meaning
to
the
tone
of
casual
merriment
with
which
zherkov
spoke
and
to
the
intentional
coldness
of
dolokhovs
replies
well
how
are
you
getting
along
with
your
superiors
asked
zherkov
well
enough
theyre
good
people
how
did
you
manage
to
turn
up
on
the
staff
by
appointment
im
on
duty
they
fell
silent
she
let
the
falcon
go
from
her
right
sleeve
let
it
go
said
the
song
involuntarily
arousing
a
cheerful
merry
feeling
their
conversation
would
probably
have
been
different
if
they
had
not
been
talking
to
the
sounds
of
the
song
so
is
it
true
the
austrians
have
been
beaten
asked
dolokhov
devil
knows
they
say
so
im
glad
dolokhov
replied
briefly
and
clearly
as
the
song
required
so
then
come
over
some
evening
well
set
up
a
game
of
faro
said
zherkov
what
have
you
got
a
lot
of
money
come
over
impossible
ive
sworn
off
it
no
drinking
and
no
gambling
until
ive
been
promoted
so
then
till
the
first
action
well
see
they
again
fell
silent
just
come
if
you
need
something
the
staff
can
always
be
helpful
said
zherkov
dolokhov
grinned
youd
best
not
worry
if
i
need
anything
i
wont
ask
ill
take
it
myself
so
then
i
just
well
and
i
too
just
goodbye
be
well
and
high
and
far
he
flew
to
his
own
native
land
zherkov
touched
his
horse
with
his
spurs
it
shifted
its
footing
three
times
excitedly
not
knowing
which
leg
to
start
with
worked
it
out
and
galloped
off
going
ahead
of
the
company
and
catching
up
with
the
coach
also
in
time
with
the
song
iii
on
returning
from
the
review
kutuzov
accompanied
by
the
austrian
general
went
to
his
office
and
calling
his
adjutant
told
him
to
bring
him
certain
papers
pertaining
to
the
condition
of
the
arriving
troops
and
letters
from
archduke
ferdinand
who
was
heading
the
army
of
the
vanguard
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
came
into
the
commander
in
chiefs
office
with
the
requested
papers
kutuzov
and
the
austrian
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
were
sitting
over
a
map
spread
out
on
the
table
ah
said
kutuzov
glancing
at
bolkonsky
as
if
with
this
word
he
was
inviting
the
adjutant
to
wait
and
went
on
with
the
conversation
begun
in
french
im
saying
only
one
thing
general
kutuzov
said
with
a
pleasant
graciousness
of
expression
and
intonation
which
made
one
listen
well
to
every
unhurriedly
uttered
word
it
could
be
seen
that
kutuzov
too
listened
to
himself
with
pleasure
im
only
saying
one
thing
general
that
if
the
matter
depended
on
my
own
personal
wish
the
will
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
franz
would
have
been
fulfilled
long
ago
i
would
long
ago
have
joined
the
archduke
and
believe
me
on
my
honor
for
me
personally
to
hand
over
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
to
a
more
knowledgeable
and
skillful
general
such
as
austria
abounds
in
and
to
lay
down
all
this
heavy
responsibility
for
me
personally
it
would
be
a
delight
but
circumstances
are
sometimes
stronger
than
we
are
general
and
kutuzov
smiled
with
such
an
expression
as
if
he
was
saying
you
have
every
right
not
to
believe
me
and
im
even
quite
indifferent
to
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
but
you
have
no
cause
for
telling
me
so
and
thats
the
whole
point
the
austrian
general
had
a
displeased
look
but
he
had
no
choice
but
to
answer
kutuzov
in
the
same
tone
on
the
contrary
he
said
in
a
peevish
and
angry
tone
quite
contradictory
to
the
flattering
meaning
of
the
words
he
spoke
on
the
contrary
your
excellencys
participation
in
the
common
cause
is
highly
appreciated
by
his
majesty
but
we
think
that
the
present
delay
is
depriving
the
valiant
russian
army
and
its
commanders
of
the
laurels
they
are
accustomed
to
reap
in
battle
he
finished
an
obviously
prepared
phrase
kutuzov
bowed
with
an
unchanging
smile
but
i
am
convinced
and
basing
myself
on
the
last
letter
with
which
his
highness
archduke
ferdinand
has
honored
me
i
suppose
that
the
austrian
troops
under
the
command
of
so
skillful
a
leader
as
general
mack
have
now
gained
a
decisive
victory
and
are
no
longer
in
need
of
our
help
said
kutuzov
the
general
frowned
though
there
was
no
positive
news
about
the
defeat
of
the
austrians
there
were
far
too
many
circumstances
confirming
the
general
unfavorable
rumors
and
therefore
kutuzovs
supposition
about
an
austrian
victory
looked
very
much
like
mockery
but
kutuzov
was
smiling
meekly
with
the
same
expression
which
said
that
he
had
the
right
to
suppose
so
in
fact
the
last
letter
he
had
had
from
macks
army
had
informed
him
of
the
victory
and
of
the
most
advantageous
strategic
position
of
the
army
give
me
that
letter
said
kutuzov
turning
to
prince
andrei
take
a
look
if
you
please
and
kutuzov
with
a
mocking
smile
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
read
in
german
for
the
austrian
general
the
following
passage
from
the
letter
of
archduke
ferdinand

sighed
deeply
as
he
finished
this
paragraph
and
looked
at
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
attentively
and
benignly
but
your
excellency
knows
the
wise
rule
which
prescribes
that
one
should
assume
the
worst
said
the
austrian
general
evidently
wishing
to
put
an
end
to
the
joking
and
get
down
to
business
he
glanced
with
displeasure
at
the
adjutant
excuse
me
general
kutuzov
interrupted
him
and
also
turned
to
prince
andrei
i
tell
you
what
my
gentle
you
get
all
the
reports
our
scouts
have
received
from
kozlovsky
here
are
two
letters
from
count
nostitz
here
is
the
letter
from
his
highness
archduke
ferdinand
here
are
some
others
he
said
handing
him
several
papers
and
from
all
this
compose
a
clear
memorandum
in
french
presenting
all
the
news
weve
had
about
the
actions
of
the
austrian
army
well
do
that
and
give
it
to
his
excellency
prince
andrei
inclined
his
head
to
indicate
that
he
had
understood
from
the
first
word
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
kutuzov
had
wished
to
tell
him
he
gathered
up
the
papers
and
making
a
general
bow
stepping
softly
over
the
carpet
went
out
to
the
waiting
room
though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
prince
andrei
left
russia
he
had
changed
much
during
that
time
in
the
expression
of
his
face
in
his
movements
in
his
gait
there
was
almost
no
trace
of
the
former
affectation
fatigue
and
laziness
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
impression
he
made
on
others
and
who
was
occupied
with
pleasant
and
interesting
things
his
face
expressed
more
satisfaction
with
himself
and
those
around
him
his
smile
and
glance
were
more
cheerful
and
attractive
kutuzov
whom
he
had
overtaken
still
in
poland
had
received
him
very
affectionately
promised
not
to
forget
him
distinguished
him
from
the
other
adjutants
taken
him
along
to
vienna
charged
him
with
more
serious
missions
from
vienna
kutuzov
wrote
to
his
old
comrade
prince
andreis
father
your
son
he
wrote
promises
to
become
an
outstanding
officer
by
his
knowledge
firmness
and
industry
i
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
such
a
subordinate
at
hand
on
kutuzovs
staff
among
his
comrades
and
colleagues
and
in
the
army
in
general
as
in
petersburg
society
prince
andrei
had
two
completely
opposite
reputations
some
the
smaller
part
considered
prince
andrei
to
be
something
distinct
from
themselves
and
from
all
others
expected
great
success
from
him
listened
to
him
admired
him
and
imitated
him
and
with
these
people
prince
andrei
was
simple
and
pleasant
others
the
majority
did
not
like
prince
andrei
considering
him
a
pompous
cold
and
unpleasant
man
but
with
these
people
prince
andrei
was
able
to
behave
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
respected
and
even
feared
coming
out
to
the
waiting
room
from
kutuzovs
office
prince
andrei
holding
the
papers
went
up
to
his
colleague
on
duty
the
adjutant
kozlovsky
who
was
sitting
by
the
window
with
a
book
well
what
is
it
prince
asked
kozlovsky
ive
been
ordered
to
compose
a
memorandum
explaining
why
we
are
not
moving
forward
and
why
is
it
prince
andrei
shrugged
his
shoulders
any
news
from
mack
asked
kozlovsky
no
if
it
were
true
that
hes
been
defeated
the
news
would
have
come
probably
said
prince
andrei
and
headed
for
the
front
door
but
just
then
the
door
slammed
and
a
tall
austrian
general
evidently
just
arrived
in
a
frock
coat
his
head
bound
in
a
black
bandage
and
the
order
of
maria
theresa
on
his
neck
quickly
entered
the
waiting
room
prince
andrei
stopped
general
in
chief
kutuzov
the
justarrived
general
spoke
quickly
with
a
strong
german
accent
glancing
to
both
sides
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
office
without
pausing
the
general
in
chief
is
busy
said
kozlovsky
hastily
going
up
to
the
unknown
general
and
barring
his
way
to
the
door
how
shall
i
announce
you
the
unknown
general
looked
down
scornfully
at
the
short
kozlovsky
as
if
surprised
that
there
could
be
people
who
did
not
know
him
the
general
in
chief
is
busy
kozlovsky
calmly
repeated
the
generals
face
frowned
his
lips
twitched
and
trembled
he
took
out
a
notebook
quickly
jotted
something
with
a
pencil
tore
out
the
page
handed
it
over
went
with
quick
steps
to
the
window
dropped
his
body
into
a
chair
and
looked
around
at
those
who
were
in
the
room
as
if
asking
why
they
were
looking
at
him
then
the
general
raised
his
head
stretched
his
neck
as
if
intending
to
say
something
but
at
once
as
if
casually
beginning
to
hum
to
himself
produced
a
strange
sound
which
at
once
broke
off
the
door
to
the
office
opened
and
kutuzov
appeared
on
the
threshold
the
general
with
the
bandaged
head
leaning
forward
as
if
fleeing
from
danger
went
up
to
kutuzov
with
long
rapid
strides
of
his
thin
legs
vous
voyez
le
malheureux
mack
he
uttered
in
a
breaking
voice
the
face
of
kutuzov
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
his
office
remained
perfectly
immobile
for
a
few
moments
then
a
wrinkle
passed
like
a
wave
over
his
face
his
brow
became
smooth
again
he
inclined
his
head
deferentially
closed
his
eyes
silently
allowed
mack
to
pass
followed
him
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
rumor
that
had
already
spread
earlier
about
the
defeat
of
the
austrians
and
the
surrender
of
the
entire
army
at
ulm
turned
out
to
be
true
within
half
an
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
out
in
various
directions
with
orders
demonstrating
that
the
russian
troops
so
far
inactive
would
soon
also
have
to
meet
the
enemy
prince
andrei
was
one
of
the
rare
officers
on
the
staff
who
placed
his
main
interest
in
the
general
course
of
military
operations
seeing
mack
and
hearing
the
details
of
his
ruin
he
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
lost
understood
all
the
difficulty
of
the
russian
troops
position
and
vividly
pictured
to
himself
what
awaited
the
army
and
the
role
he
was
to
play
in
it
involuntarily
he
experienced
an
excited
joyful
feeling
at
the
thought
of
the
disgrace
of
selfconfident
austria
and
of
the
fact
that
in
a
week
perhaps
he
would
have
to
see
and
take
the
encounter
of
the
russians
with
the
french
the
first
since
suvorov
but
he
feared
the
genius
of
bonaparte
which
might
prove
stronger
than
all
the
courage
of
the
russian
troops
and
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
allow
for
the
disgrace
of
his
hero
excited
and
irritated
by
these
thoughts
prince
andrei
went
to
his
room
to
write
to
his
father
to
whom
he
wrote
every
day
in
the
corridor
he
met
his
roommate
nesvitsky
and
the
joker
zherkov
they
were
laughing
at
something
as
usual
why
so
glum
asked
nesvitsky
noticing
prince
andreis
pale
face
with
its
glittering
eyes
theres
nothing
to
be
merry
about
replied
bolkonsky
just
as
prince
andrei
met
nesvitsky
and
zherkov
the
austrian
general
strauch
attached
to
kutuzovs
staff
to
oversee
the
supplying
of
the
russian
army
came
from
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
along
with
the
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
who
had
arrived
the
day
before
the
corridor
was
wide
enough
for
the
generals
to
pass
the
three
officers
unhindered
but
zherkov
pushing
nesvitsky
aside
with
his
hand
said
in
a
breathless
voice
theyre
comingtheyre
comingstep
aside
make
way
make
way
please
the
generals
came
on
looking
as
if
they
could
do
without
embarrassing
honors
the
face
of
the
joker
zherkov
suddenly
showed
a
stupid
smile
of
joy
which
he
seemed
unable
to
suppress
your
excellency
he
said
in
german
stepping
forward
and
addressing
the
austrian
general
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
he
bowed
his
head
and
began
scraping
with
one
foot
then
the
other
awkwardly
like
children
who
are
learning
to
dance
the
general
who
was
a
member
of
the
hofkriegsrath
looked
at
him
sternly
but
noticing
the
seriousness
of
the
stupid
smile
could
not
refuse
it
a
moments
attention
he
narrowed
his
eyes
showing
that
he
was
listening
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
general
mack
has
arrived
in
good
health
except
for
a
slight
wound
here
he
added
with
a
beaming
smile
pointing
to
his
head
the
general
frowned
turned
away
and
walked
on
gott
wie
naiv
he
said
angrily
after
going
a
few
steps
nesvitsky
guffawing
put
his
arm
around
prince
andrei
but
bolkonsky
turning
still
more
pale
with
an
angry
expression
on
his
face
pushed
him
away
and
turned
to
zherkov
the
nervous
irritation
he
had
felt
at
the
sight
of
mack
the
news
of
his
defeat
and
the
thought
of
what
awaited
the
russian
army
now
found
its
outlet
in
his
anger
at
zherkovs
inappropriate
joke
if
you
my
dear
sir
he
began
in
a
shrill
voice
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lower
jaw
wish
to
be
a
buffoon
i
cannot
prevent
you
from
being
one
but
i
announce
to
you
that
the
next
time
you
dare
to
clown
in
my
presence
i
will
teach
you
how
to
behave
nesvitsky
and
zherkov
were
so
astounded
by
this
outburst
that
they
silently
stared
wideeyed
at
bolkonsky
why
i
only
congratulated
him
said
zherkov
i
am
not
joking
with
you
kindly
keep
silent
shouted
bolkonsky
and
taking
nesvitsky
by
the
arm
he
walked
away
from
zherkov
who
was
at
a
loss
how
to
reply
well
whats
with
you
brother
nesvitsky
said
peaceably
whats
with
me
said
prince
andrei
stopping
in
agitation
understand
that
were
either
officers
serving
our
tsar
and
fatherland
and
rejoice
in
our
common
successes
and
grieve
over
our
common
failures
or
were
lackeys
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
masters
doings

le

he
said
as
if
clinching
his
opinion
by
this
french
phrase
cest
bien
pour
un
gar231on
de
rien
comme
cette
individu
dont
vous

only
schoolboys
can
have
fun
like
that
prince
andrei
added
in
russian
pronouncing
the
word
with
a
french
accent
noticing
that
zherkov
was
still
within
earshot
he
waited
for
the
cornet
to
make
some
reply
but
the
cornet
turned
and
left
the
corridor
iv
the
pavlogradsky
hussar
regiment
was
stationed
two
miles
from
braunau
the
squadron
in
which
nikolai
rostov
served
as
a
junker
had
settled
in
the
german
village
of
salzeneck
the
squadron
commander
captain
denisov
known
to
the
whole
cavalry
division
as
vaska
denisov
was
assigned
the
best
quarters
in
the
village
junker
rostov
had
been
living
with
the
squadron
commander
ever
since
he
caught
up
with
his
regiment
in
poland
on
october
8th
the
day
when
at
headquarters
all
were
brought
to
their
feet
by
the
news
of
macks
defeat
in
the
squadron
staff
life
quietly
went
on
as
before
denisov
who
had
spent
the
whole
night
playing
cards
was
still
not
home
when
rostov
on
horseback
came
back
from
foraging
early
in
the
morning
rostov
in
his
junkers
uniform
rode
up
to
the
porch
nudged
his
horse
around
swung
his
leg
over
him
in
a
supple
youthful
movement
stood
in
the
stirrup
as
if
not
wishing
to
his
horse
finally
jumped
down
and
shouted
for
the
orderly
ah
bondarenko
friend
of
my
heart
he
said
to
the
hussar
who
came
rushing
for
his
horse
give
him
a
cooling
down
my
friend
he
said
with
that
merry
brotherly
tenderness
with
which
all
fine
young
men
treat
everyone
when
they
are
happy
yes
your
excellency
the
ukrainian
replied
merrily
shaking
his
head
see
that
you
give
him
a
good
cooling
down
another
hussar
also
rushed
to
the
horse
but
bondarenko
had
already
thrown
the
reins
over
the
horses
head
one
could
see
that
the
junker
gave
good
tips
and
it
was
profitable
to
be
of
service
to
him
rostov
stroked
the
horses
neck
then
his
croup
and
stopped
on
the
porch
very
nice
what
a
horse
hell
be
he
said
to
himself
and
smiling
and
holding
his
saber
ran
up
the
steps
his
spurs
jingling
the
german
landlord
in
a
vest
and
a
cap
holding
the
fork
he
was
using
to
clear
away
dung
peeked
out
of
the
cowshed
as
soon
as
he
saw
rostov
the
germans
face
suddenly
brightened
he
smiled
merrily
and
winked
sch246n
gut
morgen
sch246n
gut
morgen
he
repeated
obviously
taking
pleasure
in
greeting
the
young
man
schon
fleissig
said
rostov
still
with
the
same
joyful
brotherly
smile
which
never
left
his
animated
face
hoch
oestreicher
hoch
russen
kaiser
alexander
hoch
he
addressed
the
german
repeating
words
often
spoken
by
the
landlord
the
german
laughed
came
all
the
way
out
of
the
cowshed
door
pulled
off
his
cap
and
waving
it
above
his
head
cried
und
die
ganze
welt
hoch
rostov
himself
like
the
german
waved
his
peaked
cap
above
his
head
and
laughing
shouted
und
vivat
die
ganze
welt
though
there
was
no
particular
reason
for
rejoicing
either
for
the
german
who
was
cleaning
his
cowshed
or
for
rostov
who
had
gone
for
hay
with
his
section
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
with
happy
delight
and
brotherly
love
shook
their
heads
as
a
sign
of
mutual
love
and
smiling
went
their
waythe
german
to
the
cowshed
and
rostov
to
the
cottage
he
occupied
with
denisov
hows

he
said
now
for
trouble
rostov
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
denisov
coming
home
denisov
was
a
small
man
with
a
red
face
shining
black
eyes
and
disheveled
black
mustaches
and
hair
he
was
wearing
an
unbuttoned
dolman
wide
pleated
trousers
ballooning
over
his
boots
and
a
crumpled
hussar
cap
perched
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
was
approaching
the
porch
gloomily
his
head
hanging
lavrushka
he
shouted
loudly
and
crossly
well

shouted
denisov
swallowing
his
rs
such
bad

bad
luckas
soon
as
you
left
it
started
hey
tea
denisov
wincing
as
if
he
was
smiling
and
baring
his
short
strong
teeth
began
tousling
his
forestthick
tangled
bushy
black
hair
with
both
shortfingered
hands
the
devil
prompted
me
to
go
to
that
rat

he
said
rubbing
his
forehead
and
face
with
both
hands
can
you
imagine
not
a
single
good
card
not
one
denisov
took
the
lighted
pipe
served
to
him
clutched
it
in
his
fist
banged
it
on
the
floor
spraying
sparks
and
went
on
shouting
he
gives
you
the
simple
and
beats
it
with
the
paroli
gives
you
the

with

he
spilled
the
fire
smashed
the
pipe
and
threw
it
away
then
he
paused
and
suddenly
glanced
merrily
at
rostov
with
his
shining
black
eyes
if
only
there
were
some
women
but
here
except
for
drinking
theres
nothing
to
do
if
only
wed
start
fighting
soonhey
whos
there
he
turned
to
the
door
hearing
the
tread
of
heavy
boots
with
jingling
spurs
come
to
a
stop
and
then
a
respectful
cough
the
sergeant
major
said
lavrushka
denisov
winced
still
more
rotten
luck
he
said
throwing
down
a
purse
with
a
few
gold
pieces
rostov
dear
heart
count
up
whats
left
and
put
it
under
the
pillow
he
said
and
went
out
to
the
sergeant
major
rostov
took
the
money
and
mechanically
sorting
the
old
and
new
coins
into
separate
piles
began
counting
it
ah
telyanin
greetings
i
blew
everything
last
night
denisovs
voice
came
from
the
other
room
where
at
bykovs
at
the
ratsi
knew
it
said
a
highpitched
voice
and
after
that
lieutenant
telyanin
a
small
officer
from
the
same
squadron
came
in
rostov
threw
the
purse
under
the
pillow
and
shook
the
small
moist
hand
that
was
held
out
to
him
telyanin
had
for
some
reason
been
transferred
from
the
guards
just
before
the
campaign
he
behaved
very
well
in
the
regiment
but
he
was
not
liked
and
rostov
especially
could
neither
overcome
nor
conceal
his
causeless
loathing
for
the
man
well
so
young
cavalryman
hows
my
little
rook
serving
you
he
asked
little
rook
was
a
saddle
horse
recently
broken
that
telyanin
had
sold
to
rostov
the
lieutenant
never
looked
the
person
he
was
talking
to
in
the
eye
his
eyes
constantly
shifted
from
one
object
to
another
i
saw
you
ride
by
today
hes
all
right
a
good
horse
replied
rostov
although
the
horse
which
he
had
bought
for
seven
hundred
rubles
was
not
worth
even
half
that
price
hes
begun
to
favor
the
left
foreleg
he
added
the
hoofs
cracked
its
nothing
ill
teach
you
ill
show
you
what
sort
of
clinch
nail
to
put
on
it
yes
please

me
said
rostov
i
will
i
will
its
no
secret
and
youll
be
thankful
for
the
horse
ill
have
the
horse
brought
then
said
rostov
wishing
to
be
rid
of
telyanin
and
he
went
to
give
orders
for
the
horse
to
be
brought
in
the
front
hall
denisov
crouching
on
the
threshold
with
his
pipe
sat
facing
the
sergeant
major
who
was
reporting
something
seeing
rostov
denisov
winced
and
pointed
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
to
the
room
where
telyanin
was
sitting
winced
again
and
shuddered
with
loathing
ach
i
dislike
the
fellow
he
said
unembarrassed
by
the
sergeant
majors
presence
rostov
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
to
say
so
do
i
but
what
to
do
and
having
given
orders
went
back
to
telyanin
telyanin
was
sitting
in
the
same
indolent
pose
in
which
rostov
had
left
him
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
there
are
such
repulsive
faces
in
the
world
thought
rostov
going
into
the
room
so
did
you
order
the
horse
brought
asked
telyanin
getting
up
and
glancing
around
casually
i
did
well
come
on
then
i
only
stopped
to
ask
denisov
about
yesterdays
orders
did
you
receive
them
denisov
not
yet
and
where
are
you
going
i
want
to
teach
the
young
man
how
to
shoe
a
horse
they
went
out
to
the
porch
and
to
the
stable
the
lieutenant
showed
him
how
to
do
a
clinch
nail
and
went
home
when
rostov
came
back
there
was
a
bottle
of
vodka
and
some
sausage
on
the
table
denisov
was
sitting
at
the
table
scratching
on
a
piece
of
paper
with
his
quill
he
glanced
darkly
at
rostovs
face
im
writing
to
her
he
said
he
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
the
quill
in
his
hand
and
obviously
glad
of
the
chance
to
quickly
speak
out
everything
he
wanted
to
write
began
reciting
his
letter
to
rostov
you
see
friend
he
said
were
asleep
until
we
love
were
children
of
dustbut
fall
in
loveand
youre

pure
as
on
the
first
day
of
creationwhos

he
shouted
to
lavrushka
who
came
up
to
him
without
the
slightest
timidity
who
is
it
you
gave
the
order
yourself
the
sergeant
majors
come
for
money
denisov
winced
was
about
to
shout
something
but
kept
silent
rotten
business
he
said
to
himself
how
much
money
was
left
in
the
purse
he
asked
rostov
seven
new
and
three
old
ah
rot
well
what
are
you
standing
there
for
scarecrow
off
to
the
sergeant
major
denisov
shouted
at
lavrushka

rostov
said
blushing
i
dont
like
getting
friends
involved

denisov
muttered
if
you
wont
take
money
from
me
as
a
friend
youll
offend
me
i
really

got
it
rostov
repeated
no
no
i

and
denisov
went
to
the
bed
to
take
his
purse
from
under
the
pillow
whered
you
put
it
rostov
under
the
bottom
pillow
its
not
there
denisov
threw
both
pillows
on
the
floor
the
purse
was
not
there
thats
odd
wait
maybe
you
dropped
it
said
rostov
picking
up
first
one
pillow
then
the
other
and
shaking
them
he
tore
off
the
blanket
and
shook
it
the
purse
was
not
there
maybe
i
forgot
no
i
thought
then
that
it
was
as
if
you
were
hiding
a
treasure
under
your
head
said
rostov
i
put
the
purse
there
where
is
it
he
turned
to
lavrushka
i
didnt
come
in
it
should
be
wherever
you
put
it
but
its
not
its
always
that
way
you
toss
something
somewhere
and
then
forget
look
in
your
pockets
no
maybe
if
i
hadnt
thought
about
the
treasure
said
rostov
but
i
remember
putting
it
there
lavrushka
rummaged
through
the
whole
bed
looked
under
it
looked
under
the
table
rummaged
about
everywhere
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
denisov
silently
followed
lavrushkas
movements
and
when
lavrushka
spread
his
arms
in
surprise
saying
it
was
not
to
be
found
anywhere
he
looked
at
rostov
rostov
youre
not
a
prankst
rostov
felt
denisovs
gaze
on
him
raised
his
eyes
and
instantly
lowered
them
all
the
blood
he
had
locked
up
somewhere
under
his
throat
rushed
to
his
face
and
eyes
he
could
scarcely
breathe
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
except
the
lieutenant
and
you
its
here
somewhere
said
lavrushka
ah
you
devils
puppet
stir
your
stumps

looking
denisov
shouted
suddenly
turning
purple
and
hurling
himself
at
the
lackey
with
a
menacing
gesture
therell
be
a
purse
or
ill
flog
you
to
death
ill
flog
you
all
to
death
rostov
avoiding
denisovs
eyes
began
to
button
his
jacket
buckled
on
his
saber
and
put
on
his
peaked
cap
i
tell
you
therell
be
a
purse
denisov
shouted
shaking
the
orderly
by
the
shoulder
and
pushing
him
against
the
wall
denisov
leave
him
alone
i
know
who
took
it
said
rostov
approaching
the
door
and
not
raising
his
eyes
denisov
paused
reflected
and
evidently
realizing
what
rostov
was
alluding
to
seized
his
arm
rubbish
he
shouted
so
that
the
veins
swelled
like
ropes
on
his
neck
and
forehead
youve
lost
your
mind
i
tell
you
i
wont
stand
for
it
the
purse
is
here
ill
skin
this
scoundrel
alive
and
it
will
be
here
i
know
who
took
it
rostov
repeated
in
a
trembling
voice
going
to
the
door
and
i
tell
you
dont
you
dare
do
that
cried
denisov
rushing
at
the
junker
to
hold
him
back
but
rostov
tore
his
arm
free
and
with
as
much
spite
as
if
denisov
was
his
greatest
enemy
directly
and
firmly
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
do
you
realize
what
youre
saying
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
besides
me
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
which
means
if
thats
not
it
then
he
was
unable
to
finish
and
ran
out
of
the
room
ah
the
devil
take
you
and
all
the
rest
of
them
were
the
last
words
rostov
heard
rostov
went
to
telyanins
quarters
the
masters
not
at
home
hes
gone
to
the
staff
telyanins
orderly
told
him
has
something
happened
the
orderly
added
surprised
to
see
the
junkers
upset
face
no
nothing
you
just
missed
him
said
the
orderly
the
staff
was
quartered
two
miles
from
salzeneck
without
stopping
at
home
rostov
took
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
staff
in
the
village
occupied
by
the
staff
there
was
a
tavern
frequented
by
the
officers
rostov
rode
to
the
tavern
near
the
porch
he
saw
telyanins
horse
the
lieutenant
was
sitting
in
the
second
room
of
the
tavern
over
a
plate
of
sausage
and
a
bottle
of
wine
ah
youve
come
too
young
man
he
said
smiling
and
raising
his
eyebrows
high
yes
said
rostov
as
if
it
cost
him
great
effort
to
utter
this
word
and
sat
at
the
next
table
both
were
silent
there
were
two
germans
in
the
room
and
a
russian
officer
everyone
was
silent
and
only
the
clank
of
knives
against
plates
was
heard
and
the
lieutenants
chomping
when
telyanin
finished
his
lunch
he
took
a
double
purse
from
his
pocket
opened
the
clasp
with
his
small
white
upturned
fingers
took
out
a
gold
coin
and
raising
his
eyebrows
gave
it
to
the
waiter
make
it
quick
please
he
said
the
coin
was
a
new
one
rostov
got
up
and
went
over
to
telyanin
may
i
look
at
your
purse
he
said
in
a
low
barely
audible
voice
with
shifty
eyes
but
still
raising
his
eyebrows
telyanin
handed
him
the
purse
yes
a
pretty
purseyesyes
he
said
and
suddenly
turned
pale
have
a
look
young
man
he
added
rostov
took
the
purse
in
his
hands
and
looked
at
it
and
at
the
money
that
was
in
it
and
at
telyanin
the
lieutenant
glanced
about
as
was
his
habit
and
suddenly
seemed
to
become
very
merry
if
we
get
to
vienna
ill
leave
it
all
there
but
theres
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
these
trashy
little
towns
he
said
well
young
man
give
it
to
me
im
leaving
rostov
was
silent
and
why
are
you
here
also
to
have
lunch
the
foods
quite
good
telyanin
went
on
give
it
to
me
he
reached
out
and
put
his
hand
on
the
purse
rostov
let
go
of
it
telyanin
took
the
purse
and
began
to
lower
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
riding
breeches
his
eyebrows
raised
casually
and
his
mouth
slightly
open
as
if
he
was
saying
yes
yes
im
putting
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
its
quite
simple
and
its
nobodys
business
well
then
young
man
he
said
sighing
and
looking
into
rostovs
eyes
from
under
his
raised
eyebrows
some
sort
of
light
quick
as
an
electric
spark
passed
from
telyanins
eyes
to
the
eyes
of
rostov
and
back
and
forth
and
back
again
all
in
an
instant
come
here
said
rostov
seizing
telyanin
by
the
arm
he
almost
dragged
him
to
the
window
thats
denisovs
money
you
took
it
he
whispered
in
his
ear
whatwhathow
dare
you
what
said
telyanin
but
these
words
sounded
like
a
pitiful
desperate
cry
and
a
plea
for
forgiveness
as
soon
as
rostov
heard
the
sound
of
that
voice
a
huge
burden
of
doubt
fell
from
his
soul
he
felt
joy
and
in
the
same
instant
also
pity
for
the
wretched
man
standing
before
him
but
he
had
to
bring
the
matter
he
had
begun
to
a
conclusion
god
knows
what
the
people
here
may
think
telyanin
murmured
seizing
his
peaked
cap
and
going
into
a
small
empty
room
we
must
have
a
talk
i
know
it
and
ill
prove
it
said
rostov
i
every
muscle
in
telyanins
frightened
pale
face
began
to
quiver
his
eyes
shifted
as
before
but
somewhere
low
down
not
rising
to
rostovs
face
and
there
was
a
sound
of
sobbing
countdont
ruina
young
manheres
this
wretchedmoney
take
it
he
threw
it
on
the
table
i
have
an
old
father
a
mother
rostov
took
the
money
avoiding
telyanins
eyes
and
not
saying
a
word
started
out
of
the
room
but
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
came
back
my
god
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
could
you
have
done
it
count
said
telyanin
going
up
to
the
junker
dont
touch
me
said
rostov
drawing
back
if
you
need
the
money
take
it
he
flung
the
purse
at
him
and
ran
out
of
the
tavern
v
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
an
animated
conversation
was
going
on
among
the
squadron
officers
in
denisovs
quarters
and
i
tell
you
rostov
that
youve
got
to
apologize
to
the
regimental
commander
said
a
tall
staff
captain
with
grizzled
hair
enormous
mustaches
and
a
largefeatured
wrinkled
face
to
the
crimsonfaced
excited
rostov
staff
captain
kirsten
had
twice
been
broken
to
the
ranks
for
affairs
of
honor
and
had
twice
won
back
his
commission
i
wont
allow
anyone
to
call
me
a
liar
cried
rostov
he
called
me
a
liar
and
i
called
him
a
liar
let
it
remain
at
that
he
can
assign
me
to
duty
every
day
or
put
me
under
arrest
but
no
one
will
make
me
apologize
because
if
he
as
the
regimental
commander
considers
it
beneath
him
to
give
me
satisfaction
then
wait
a
minute
my
dear
boy
listen
to
me
the
staff
captain
interrupted
in
his
bass
voice
calmly
stroking
his
long
mustache
you
tell
the
regimental
commander
in
front
of
other
officers
that
an
officer
has
stolen
its
not
my
fault
that
the
conversation
started
in
front
of
other
officers
maybe
i
shouldnt
have
spoken
in
front
of
them
but
im
no
diplomat
i
joined
the
hussars
because
i
thought
there
was
no
need
for
subtleties
here
but
he
calls
me
a
liarso
let
him
give
me
satisfaction
thats
all
well
and
good
nobody
thinks
youre
a
coward
but
thats
not
the
point
ask
denisov
what
it
looks
like
if
a
junker
demands
satisfaction
from
a
regimental
commander
denisov
chewing
his
mustache
was
listening
to
the
conversation
with
a
gloomy
air
apparently
unwilling
to
enter
into
it
to
the
staff
captains
question
he
shook
his
head
negatively
you
tell
the
regimental
commander
about
this
muck
in
front
of
officers
the
staff
captain
went
on
bogdanych
the
regimental
commander
was
known
as
bogdanych
brings
you
up
short
he
didnt
bring
me
up
short
he
said
i
wasnt
telling
the
truth
well
yes
and
you
said
a
heap
of
foolish
things
to
him
and
youve
got
to
apologize
not
for
anything
cried
rostov
i
wouldnt
have
thought
it
of
you
the
staff
captain
said
gravely
and
sternly
you
dont
want
to
apologize
but
you
my
dear
boy
are
to
blame
all
around
not
only
before
him
but
before
the
whole
regiment
before
us
all
and
heres
how
you
might
have
reflected
and
taken
advice
on
how
to
handle
this
matter
but
you
blurted
it
right
out
and
in
front
of
officers
whats
the
regimental
commander
to
do
now
should
he
prosecute
the
officer
and
besmirch
the
whole
regiment
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
because
of
one
scoundrel
is
that
your
view
of
it
well
its
not
ours
and
bogdanych
is
a
fine
fellow
for
saying
you
werent
telling
the
truth
its
unpleasant
but
whats
to
be
done
my
dear
boy
you
asked
for
it
and
now
when
the
affair
should
be
hushed
up
out
of
some
sort
of
cockiness
you
refuse
to
apologize
but
want
to
have
it
all
out
it
offends
you
that
you
have
to
go
on
duty
but
what
is
it
for
you
to
apologize
to
an
old
and
honorable
officer
whatever
bogdanych
may
have
done
he
is
after
all
an
honorable
and
brave
old
coloneland
yet
youre
offended
and
to
besmirch
the
whole
regiment
is
nothing
to
you
the
staff
captains
voice
began
to
tremble
you
my
dear
boy
have
been
with
the
regiment
next
to
no
time
here
today
tomorrow
somewhere
else
as
a
little
adjutant
you
couldnt
care
less
if
people
say
there
are
thieves
among
the
pavlogradsky
officers
but
its
not
all
the
same
to
us
isnt

kutuzov
fell
back
towards
vienna
destroying
behind
him
the
bridges
over
the
rivers
inn
in
braunau
and
traun
in
linz
on
the
twentythird
of
october
the
russian
troops
were
crossing
the
river
enns
at
midday
russian
transport
artillery
and
troop
columns
were
strung
out
through
the
town
of
enns
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
the
day
was
warm
autumnal
and
rainy
the
vast
prospect
that
opened
out
from
the
height
where
the
russian
batteries
stood
defending
the
bridge
was
now
suddenly
covered
by
a
muslin
curtain
of
slanting
rain
then
suddenly
widened
out
and
in
the
sunlight
objects
became
visible
and
clear
in
the
distance
as
if
freshly
varnished
at
ones
feet
one
could
see
the
little
town
with
its
white
houses
and
red
roofs
the
cathedral
and
the
bridge
on
both
sides
of
which
streamed
crowding
masses
of
russian
troops
at
the
bend
of
the
danube
one
could
see
boats
and
an
island
and
a
castle
with
a
park
surrounded
by
the
waters
of
the
enns
falling
into
the
danube
one
could
see
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
rocky
and
covered
with
pine
forest
with
a
mysterious
distance
of
green
treetops
and
bluish
gorges
one
could
see
the
towers
of
a
convent
looming
up
from
the
pine
forest
with
its
wild
and
untouched
look
and
far
away
on
a
hilltop
on
the
other
side
of
the
enns
one
could
see
the
mounted
patrols
of
the
enemy
amidst
the
cannons
on
the
height
the
general
in
charge
of
the
rear
guard
stood
out
in
front
with
an
officer
of
the
suite
examining
the
area
through
a
spyglass
slightly
behind
him
on
the
trail
of
a
cannon
sat
nesvitsky
sent
to
the
rear
guard
by
the
commander
in
chief
the
cossack
who
accompanied
nesvitsky
handed
him
a
bag
and
a
flask
and
nesvitsky
treated
the
officers
to
savory
little
pies
and
real
doppelk252mmel
the
officers
joyfully
surrounded
him
some
kneeling
some
sitting
turkish
fashion
on
the
wet
grass
yes
the
austrian
prince
who
built
a
castle
here
was
no
fool
a
fine
place
why
arent

gentlemen
said
nesvitsky
i
humbly

replied
one
of
the
officers
taking
pleasure
in
conversing
with
such
an
important
staff
official
an
excellent
place

passed
just
by
the
park

two
deer

a
wonderful
house

prince
said
another
who
very
much
wanted
to
take
one
more
little
pie
but
was
embarrassed
and
who
therefore
pretended
to
be
surveying
the
area
look
our
infantrymen
have
already
gotten
in
there
over
there
in
the
little
meadow
beyond
the
village

of
them

castle
he
said
with
obvious
approval
they

nesvitsky

but
what
id
like
he
added
chewing
a
little
pie
with
his
handsome
moist
mouth
is
to
climb
in
there
he
pointed
to
the
convent
with
its
towers
visible
on
the
hilltop
he
smiled
his
eyes
narrowed
and
lit
up
wouldnt
that
be
nice
gentlemen
the
officers
laughed
at
least
to
put
a
fright
into
those
little
nuns
there
are
some
italian
girls
young
ones
they
say
really
id
give
five
years
of
my
life
they
must
be
bored
too
an
officer
a
bolder
one
said
laughing
meanwhile
the
officer
of
the
suite
who
was
standing
in
front
was
pointing
something
out
to
the
general
the
general
was
looking
through
the
glass
well
thats
it
thats
it
the
general
said
angrily
taking
the
glass
from
his
eye
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
thats
it
theyre
going
to
fire
on
the
crossing
and
what
are
they
dawdling
for
on
the
other
side
the
naked
eye
could
make
out
the
enemy
and
his
battery
from
which
a
puff
of
milkwhite
smoke
appeared
the
smoke
was
followed
by
the
sound
of
a
distant
shot
and
it
could
be
seen
how
our
troops
speeded
up
at
the
crossing
nesvitsky
huffing
got
up
and
smiling
went
over
to
the
general
wouldnt
your
excellency
like
a
bite
to
eat
he
said
a
bad
business
said
the
general
not
answering
him
our
men
have
been
dawdling
shouldnt
i
ride
over
your
excellency
said
nesvitsky
yes
please
do
said
the
general
repeating
what
had
already
been
ordered
in
detail
and
tell
the
hussars
that
they
are
to
cross
last
and
set
fire
to
the
bridge
as
i
said
and
inspect
the
flammable
material
while
still
on
the
bridge
very
good
sir
replied
nesvitsky
he
called
the
cossack
with
the
horse
told
him
to
put
the
bag
and
flask
away
and
lightly
swung
his
heavy
body
into
the
saddle
ill
stop
by
those
nuns
really
he
said
to
the
officers
who
were
looking
at
him
smilingly
and
rode
down
the
hill
along
a
winding
path
well
lets
give
it
a
try
captain
see
how
far
it
will
carry
said
the
general
turning
to
the
artillerist
have
some
fun
out
of
boredom
crew
to
your
pieces
the
officer
commanded
and
in
a
minute
the
artillery
crew
ran
merrily
from
their
campfires
and
loaded
up
one
came
the
command
number
one
leaped
back
briskly
a
deafening
metallic
sound
rang
out
and
a
shell
flew
whistling
over
the
heads
of
all
our
men
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
falling
far
short
of
the
enemy
showed
by
a
puff
of
smoke
the
place
where
it
hit
and
burst
the
faces
of
the
soldiers
and
officers
cheered
up
at
this
sound
everybody
stood
up
and
began
watching
the
movements
of
our
troops
below
visible
as
on
the
palm
of
the
hand
and
further
away
the
movements
of
the
advancing
enemy
just
then
the
sun
came
all
the
way
out
from
behind
the
clouds
and
the
beautiful
sound
of
the
solitary
shot
and
the
shining
of
the
bright
sun
merged
into
one
cheerful
and
merry
impression
vii
two
enemy
cannonballs
had
already
gone
flying
over
the
bridge
and
there
was
a
crush
on
the
bridge
itself
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
dismounted
from
his
horse
his
fat
body
pressed
to
the
railing
stood
prince
nesvitsky
he
looked
back
laughingly
at
his
cossack
who
stood
a
few
paces
behind
him
holding
the
two
horses
by
the
bridle
the
moment
prince
nesvitsky
tried
to
move
on
soldiers
and
carts
pushed
him
back
and
pressed
him
to
the
railing
again
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
smile
you
there
brother
the
cossack
said
to
a
supply
soldier
with
a
cart
who
was
pushing
through
the
infantrymen
crowded
right
against
his
wheels
and
horses
you
there
as
if
you
cant
wait
look
the
general
needs
to
pass
but
the
supply
soldier
paying
no
heed
the
denomination
of
general
shouted
at
the
soldiers
who
blocked
his
way
hey
countrymen
keep
to
the
left
hold
up
but
the
countrymen
pressed
shoulder
to
shoulder
catching
on
their
bayonets
and
never
pausing
moved
across
the
bridge
in
a
solid
mass
looking
down
over
the
railing
prince
nesvitsky
saw
the
swift
noisy
low
waves
of
the
enns
which
merging
rippling
and
swirling
around
the
pilings
of
the
bridge
drove
on
one
after
the
other
looking
at
the
bridge
he
saw
the
same
monotonous
living
waves
of
soldiers
shoulder
braids
shakos
with
dustcovers
packs
bayonets
long
muskets
and
under
the
shakos
faces
with
wide
cheekbones
sunken
cheeks
and
carefree
weary
faces
and
feet
moving
over
the
sticky
mud
that
covered
the
planks
of
the
bridge
occasionally
amidst
the
monotonous
waves
of
soldiers
like
a
spray
of
white
foam
on
the
waves
of
the
enns
an
officer
pushed
his
way
through
in
a
cape
with
his
physiognomy
distinct
from
the
soldiers
occasionally
like
a
chip
of
wood
swirled
along
by
the
river
a
dismounted
hussar
an
orderly
or
a
local
inhabitant
was
borne
across
the
bridge
by
the
waves
of
infantry
occasionally
like
a
log
floating
down
the
river
a
companys
or
an
officers
cart
floated
across
the
bridge
surrounded
on
all
sides
loaded
to
the
top
and
covered
with
leather
look
at
em
its
like
a
dam
burst
the
cossack
said
stopping
hopelessly
are
there
many
of
you
there
one
shy
of
a
million
a
merry
soldier
in
a
torn
greatcoat
passing
close
by
said
with
a
wink
and
vanished
after
him
came
another
old
soldier
once
he
he
was
the
enemy
starts
peppering
the
bridge
the
old
soldier
said
gloomily
addressing
his
comrade
youll
forget
about
scratching
yourself
and
the
soldier
passed
by
after
him
came
another
soldier
on
a
cart
where
the
devil
did
you
stuff
those
foot
cloths
said
an
orderly
running
behind
the
cart
and
rummaging
in
the
back
and
this
one
passed
by
with
the
cart
after
him
came
some
merry
and
apparently
tipsy
soldiers
he
just
gave
it
to
him
the
dear
fellow
right
in
the
teeth
with
his
musket
butt
one
soldier
in
a
hightucked
greatcoat
said
joyfully
swinging
his
arm
widely
thats
it
the
sweet
taste
of
ham
replied
another
with
a
guffaw
and
they
passed
by
so
that
nesvitsky
never
learned
who
got
it
in
the
teeth
and
what
the
ham
referred
to
look
at
em
scurrying
he
fires
off
a
cold
one
and
youd
think
they
were
all
getting
killed
a
warrant
officer
said
angrily
and
reproachfully
when
that
cannonball
went
flying
by
me
uncle
a
young
soldier
with
a
huge
mouth
said
barely
holding
back
his
laughter
i
just
went
dead
by
god
i
got
scared
really
bad
the
soldier
said
as
if
boasting
that
he
was
scared
and
that
one
passed
by
after
him
came
a
cart
unlike
all
those
that
had
driven
by
so
far
it
was
a
german
vorspann
and
pair
loaded
with
what
seemed
like
a
whole
household
behind
the
vorspann
led
by
a
german
was
tied
a
beautiful
spotted
cow
with
a
huge
udder
a
woman
with
a
nursing
baby
an
old
woman
and
a
young
healthy
german
girl
with
purplered
cheeks
were
sitting
on
featherbeds
it
was
clear
that
these
were
local
people
who
had
been
allowed
to
move
by
special
permission
the
eyes
of
all
the
soldiers
turned
to
the
women
and
as
the
cart
went
by
moving
step
by
step
all
the
soldiers
remarks
were
addressed
only
to
these
two
women
all
the
soldiers
faces
bore
virtually
one
and
the
same
smile
of
indecent
thoughts
about
these
women
look
the
sausage
is
also
taking
off
sell
me
the
little
lady
another
soldier
said
with
a
stress
on
the
last
syllable
addressing
the
german
who
lowering
his
eyes
walked
on
with
big
strides
angry
and
frightened
look
how
dressed
up
she
is
the
devils
nice
to
get
billeted
on
them
fedotov
i
should
live
so
long
brother
where
are
you
going
asked
an
infantry
officer
eating
an
apple
also
with
a
half
smile
and
looking
at
the
beautiful
girl
the
german
shut
his
eyes
to
show
that
he
did
not
understand
if
you
want
it
take
it
said
the
officer
handing
the
apple
to
the
girl
the
girl
smiled
and
took
it
like
everyone
else
on
the
bridge
nesvitsky
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
women
until
they
had
passed
once
they
had
passed
there
again
came
the
same
soldiers
with
the
same
talk
and
finally
everybody
stopped
as
often
happens
the
horses
pulling
the
company
cart
balked
at
the
exit
from
the
bridge
and
the
whole
crowd
had
to
wait
what
did
they
stop
for
theres
no
order
said
the
soldiers
whats
this
shoving
ahead
devil
take
it
theres
such
a
thing
as
waiting
itll
be
worse
if
he
sets
fire
to
the
bridge
see
even
the
officer
got
shoved
aside
the
halted
crowds
were
saying
on
different
sides
looking
at
each
other
and
still
pressing
forward
towards
the
exit
having
looked
under
the
bridge
at
the
waters
of
the
enns
nesvitsky
suddenly
heard
a
sound
still
new
to
him
the
swift
approach
ofsomething
big
and
something
splashed
into
the
water
see
what
hes
fixing
on
a
soldier
standing
nearby
said
sternly
turning
towards
the
sound
hes
hustling
us
so
well
cross
quicker
another
said
uneasily
the
crowd
started
moving
again
nesvitsky
realized
that
it
was
a
cannonball
hey
cossack
my
horse
he
said
hey
you
aside
step
aside
make
way
with
great
effort
he
reached
his
horse
shouting
constantly
he
began
to
move
ahead
the
soldiers
pressed
back
to
let
him
pass
then
pressed
together
again
so
hard
that
his
leg
was
squashed
and
those
closest
to
him
were
not
to
blame
for
they
were
pressed
still
harder
nesvitsky
nesvitsky
you
rascal
a
hoarse
voice
came
from
behind
just
then
nesvitsky
turned
and
saw
fifteen
paces
away
separated
from
him
by
the
living
mass
of
moving
infantry
red
black
disheveled
his
peaked
cap
pushed
back
his
dolman
thrown
dashingly
over
his
shouldervaska
denisov
tell
these
damned
devils
to
clear
the
road
shouted
denisov
obviously
in
a
fit
of
temper
his
coalblack
eyes
with
bloodshot
whites
rolling
and
shining
and
waving
his
sheathed
saber
which
he
held
in
a
small
bare
hand
as
red
as
his
face
hey
vasya
nesvitsky
replied
joyfully
whats
the
matter
the
squadron
cant
pass
shouted
vaska
denisov
angrily
baring
his
white
teeth
spurring
his
handsome
ravenblack
bedouin
who
twitching
his
ears
from
running
into
bayonets
snorting
spraying
foam
around
him
from
his
bit
jingling
stamped
his
hooves
on
the
planks
of
the
bridge
and
seemed
ready
to
jump
over
the
railing
if
his
rider
would
let
him
what
is
this
like
sheep
just
like
sheep
awayclear
the
road
wait
you
there
you
with
the
cart
you
devil
ill
take
my
sword
to
you
he
shouted
actually
drawing
his
saber
and
beginning
to
wave
it
the
soldiers
pressed
close
together
with
frightened
faces
and
denisov
joined
nesvitsky
how
is
it
youre
not
drunk
today
nesvitsky
said
to
denisov
when
he
rode
up
to
him
they
dont
even
give
us
time
to
drink
replied
vaska
denisov
they
drag
the
regiment
here
and
there
all
day
if
its
fighting
its
fighting
or
else
devil
knows
what
it
is
what
a
dandy
you
are
today
said
nesvitsky
looking
over
his
new
dolman
and
saddlecloth
denisov
smiled
took
from
his
pouch
a
handkerchief
that
gave
off
a
smell
of
scent
and
put
it
to
nesvitskys
nose
have
to
be
im
going
into
action
shaved
brushed
my
teeth
and
doused
myself
with
scent
the
stately
figure
of
nesvitsky
accompanied
by
the
cossack
and
the
resoluteness
of
denisov
waving
his
saber
and
shouting
desperately
had
such
an
effect
that
they
pushed
through
to
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
and
stopped
the
infantry
at
the
exit
nesvitsky
found
the
colonel
to
whom
he
was
to
give
the
order
and
having
fulfilled
his
mission
rode
back
again
having
cleared
the
road
denisov
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
casually
holding
back
his
stallion
who
was
straining
towards
his
fellows
and
stamping
his
foot
he
looked
at
the
squadron
that
was
moving
towards
him
the
transparent
sounds
of
hooves
rang
out
on
the
planks
of
the
bridge
as
if
several
horses
were
galloping
and
the
squadron
with
officers
in
front
four
men
abreast
stretched
across
the
bridge
and
began
to
come
out
on
the
other
side
the
halted
infantry
soldiers
crowding
in
the
trampled
mud
by
the
bridge
gazed
at
the
clean
foppish
hussars
going
past
them
in
order
with
that
special
feeling
of
ill
will
alienation
and
mockery
with
which
different
branches
of
the
military
usually
meet
each
other
sprucedup
lads
fit
for
the
fairground
whats
the
good
of
them
theyre
only
led
around
for
show
said
another
dont
raise
dust
you
footsloggers
joked
a
hussar
whose
horse
prancing
splashed
mud
at
the
infantryman
make
a
couple
of
marches
with
a
pack
on
your
back
your
fancy
trim
will
turn
shabby
the
infantryman
said
wiping
the
mud
from
his
face
with
his
sleeve
or
maybe
its
not
a
man
but
a
bird
perched
up
there
wouldnt
you
be
a
nimble
one
zikin
if
they
set
you
on
a
horse
a
corporal
joked
to
a
thin
little
soldier
bent
under
a
heavy
pack
put
a
stick
between
your
legs
thatll
do
you
for
a
horse
rejoined
the
hussar
viii
the
rest
of
the
infantry
hurriedly
crossed
the
bridge
squeezing
into
a
funnel
at
the
entrance
finally
all
the
carts
passed
over
the
crush
eased
up
and
the
last
battalion
entered
the
bridge
only
the
hussars
of
denisovs
squadron
remained
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
facing
the
enemy
the
enemy
visible
in
the
distance
from
the
opposite
hill
were
not
yet
visible
from
the
bridge
below
because
from
the
bottom
where
the
river
flowed
the
horizon
was
bounded
by
the
opposite
heights
less
than
half
a
mile
away
ahead
was
a
deserted
space
over
which
clusters
of
our
cossack
patrols
moved
here
and
there
suddenly
on
the
road
going
up
the
opposite
heights
appeared
troops
in
blue
coats
and
artillery
it
was
the
french
a
cossack
patrol
moved
down
the
hill
at
a
trot
all
the
officers
and
men
of
denisovs
squadron
though
they
tried
to
talk
about
unrelated
things
and
look
elsewhere
constantly
thought
only
about
what
was
there
on
the
hill
and
kept
peering
at
the
spots
that
appeared
on
the
horizon
which
they
recognized
as
enemy
troops
after
midday
the
weather
cleared
again
the
sun
shone
brightly
going
down
over
the
danube
and
the
dark
hills
around
it
it
was
still
and
once
in
a
while
from
that
hill
floated
the
sounds
of
bugles
and
the
shouts
of
the
enemy
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
there
was
now
nothing
but
some
small
patrols
they
were
separated
by
an
empty
space
of
about
six
hundred
yards
the
enemy
stopped
shooting
and
that
strict
menacing
inaccessible
and
elusive
line
that
separates
two
enemy
armies
became
all
the
more
clearly
felt
one
step
beyond
that
line
reminiscent
of
the
line
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
and
its
the
unknown
suffering
and
death
and
what
is
there
who
is
there
there
beyond
this
field
and
the
tree
and
the
roof
lit
by
the
sun
no
one
knows
and
you
would
like
to
know
and
youre
afraid
to
cross
that
line
and
would
like
to
cross
it
and
you
know
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
have
to
cross
it
and
find
out
what
is
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
as
you
will
inevitably
find
out
what
is
there
on
the
other
side
of
death
and
youre
strong
healthy
cheerful
and
excited
and
surrounded
by
people
just
as
strong
and
excitedly
animated
so
if
he
does
not
think
it
every
man
feels
who
finds
himself
within
sight
of
an
enemy
and
this
feeling
gives
a
particular
brilliance
and
joyful
sharpness
of
impression
to
everything
that
happens
in
those
moments
on
a
knoll
occupied
by
the
enemy
the
smoke
of
a
shot
appeared
and
a
cannonball
flew
whistling
over
the
heads
of
the
hussar
squadron
the
officers
who
were
standing
together
rode
to
their
posts
the
hussars
assiduously
began
lining
up
their
horses
everything
became
hushed
in
the
squadron
everyone
kept
looking
ahead
at
the
enemy
and
at
the
squadron
commander
awaiting
a
command
another
cannonball
flew
over
then
a
third
obviously
the
shots
were
aimed
at
the
hussars
but
the
cannonballs
with
a
rapid
steady
whistling
kept
flying
over
the
hussars
heads
and
hitting
somewhere
behind
them
the
hussars
did
not
look
back
but
with
each
sound
of
a
flying
cannonball
the
whole
squadron
as
if
on
command
with
all
their
similarly
dissimilar
faces
holding
their
breath
while
the
cannonball
flew
over
rose
in
their
stirrups
then
lowered
themselves
again
without
turning
their
heads
the
soldiers
looked
sideways
at
each
other
curious
to
spy
out
a
comrades
impressions
on
each
face
from
denisovs
down
to
the
buglers
there
appeared
around
the
lips
and
chin
one
common
trait
of
a
struggle
between
irritation
and
excitement
the
sergeant
major
frowned
looking
the
soldiers
over
as
if
threatening
them
with
punishment
junker
mironov
ducked
down
each
time
a
cannonball
flew
by
rostov
standing
on
the
left
flank
on
his
slightly
lame
but
imposing
little
rook
had
the
happy
air
of
a
schoolboy
called
up
before
a
large
public
at
an
examination
in
which
he
is
sure
he
will
distinguish
himself
he
looked
around
at
them
all
serenely
and
brightly
as
if
asking
them
to
pay
attention
to
how
calmly
he
stood
under
fire
but
on
his
face
too
that
same
trait
of
something
new
and
stern
appeared
against
his
will
around
the
mouth
whos
that
bowing
there
junker
mironov
not
right
look
at
me
shouted
denisov
who
could
not
stay
still
and
fidgeted
on
his
horse
in
front
of
the
squadron
vaska
denisovs
pugnosed
and
blackhaired
face
and
his
whole
small
compact
figure
with
his
sinewy
hand
the
short
fingers
covered
with
hair
in
which
he
gripped
the
hilt
of
his
bared
saber
was
the
same
as
ever
especially
towards
evening
after
drinking
a
couple
of
bottles
only
he
was
more
red
than
usual
and
throwing
his
shaggy
head
back
the
way
birds
do
when
they
drink
and
mercilessly
digging
the
spurs
on
his
small
feet
into
the
sides
of
the
good
bedouin
he
galloped
off
as
if
falling
backwards
to
the
other
flank
of
the
squadron
and
shouted
in
a
hoarse
voice
that
they
should
inspect
their
pistols
he
rode
up
to
kirsten
the
staff
captain
on
his
broad
and
sedate
mare
rode
slowly
to
meet
denisov
the
staff
captain
with
his
long
mustaches
was
as
serious
as
ever
only
his
eyes
shone
more
than
usual
well
what
he
said
to
denisov
it
wont
come
to
a
fight
youll
see
well
withdraw
devil
knows
what
theyre
up
to
denisov
grumbled
ah
rostov
he
cried
to
the
junker
noticing
his
cheerful
face
well
youre
done
waiting
and
he
smiled
approvingly
obviously
glad
for
the
junker
rostov
felt
himself
perfectly
happy
just
then
the
commander
appeared
on
the
bridge
denisov
galloped
towards
him
your
excellency
allow
us
to
attack
ill
crush
them
attack
indeed
the
colonel
said
in
a
bored
voice
wincing
as
if
a
fly
was
pestering
him
and
why
are
you
standing
here
you
can
see
the
flanks
are
retreating
bring
the
squadron
back
across
the
squadron
crossed
the
bridge
and
moved
out
of
the
range
of
fire
without
losing
a
single
man
after
them
the
second
squadron
forming
a
line
also
crossed
and
the
last
cossacks
cleared
off
from
that
side
having
crossed
the
bridge
the
two
squadrons
of
the
pavlogradsky
hussars
went
back
up
the
hill
one
after
the
other
the
regimental
commander
karl
bogdanovich
schubert
rode
over
to
denisovs
squadron
and
fell
in
step
with
them
not
far
from
rostov
paying
no
attention
to
him
though
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
seen
each
other
since
their
confrontation
over
telyanin
rostov
feeling
himself
at
the
front
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
before
whom
he
now
considered
himself
guilty
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
athletic
back
blond
nape
and
red
neck
of
the
regimental
commander
at
first
it
seemed
to
rostov
that
bogdanych
was
only
pretending
to
be
inattentive
and
that
his
whole
goal
now
consisted
in
testing
the
junkers
courage
and
he
sat
up
straight
and
looked
around
cheerfully
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
bogdanych
was
deliberately
riding
close
to
him
in
order
to
show
rostov
his
own
courage
then
he
thought
that
his
enemy
would
now
deliberately
send
the
squadron
into
a
desperate
attack
in
order
to
punish
him
rostov
then
he
thought
that
after
the
attack
he
would
come
to
him
as
he
lay
wounded
and
magnanimously
offer
him
a
conciliatory
hand
zherkov
with
his
shoulders
raised
high
a
familiar
figure
to
the
pavlogradsky
hussars
he
had
recently
quit
their
regiment
rode
up
to
the
regimental
commander
after
his
expulsion
from
the
head
staff
zherkov
had
not
remained
with
the
regiment
saying
that
he
was
no
fool
to
drudge
away
at
the
front
when
he
could
get
more
decorations
while
doing
nothing
on
the
staff
and
he
had
managed
to
set
himself
up
as
an
orderly
officer
for
prince
bagration
he
came
to
his
former
superior
with
an
order
from
the
commander
of
the
rear
guard
colonel
he
said
with
his
gloomy
earnestness
addressing
rostovs
enemy
and
looking
around
at
his
comrades
there
is
an
order
to
stop
and
set
fire
to
the
bridge
an
order
of
who
the
colonel
asked
sullenly
i
dont
know
of
who
colonel
the
cornet
replied
earnestly
only
the
prince
told
me
go
and
tell
the
colonel
that
the
hussars
must
turn
back
quickly
and
set
fire
to
the
bridge
after
zherkov
an
officer
of
the
suite
rode
up
to
the
hussar
colonel
with
the
same
order
after
the
officer
of
the
suite
on
a
cossack
horse
that
was
barely
able
to
gallop
under
him
fat
nesvitsky
rode
up
what
is
this
colonel
he
cried
while
still
riding
i
told
you
to
set
fire
to
the
bridge
and
somebody
got
it
wrong
everybodys
going
crazy
there
they
cant
figure
it
out
the
colonel
unhurriedly
halted
his
regiment
and
turned
to
nesvitsky
you
spoke
to
me
about
flammable
material
he
said
but
you
said
nothing
to
me
about
setting
feuer
to
it
what
do
you
mean
my
dear
man
nesvitsky
said
stopping
taking
off
his
cap
and
smoothing
his
sweatdampened
hair
with
a
plump
hand
what
do
you
mean
i
didnt
tell
you
to
set
fire
to
the
bridge
since
you
put
flammable
material
there
i
am
not
dear
man
to
you
mister
staff
officer
and
you
did
not
tell
me
to
set
feuer
to
the
bridge
i
know
the
serfiss
and
i
am
habituated
to
strictly
fulfilling
orders
you
said
the
bridge
vas
to
be
set
on
feuer
but
who
vould
set
it
on
feuer
i
cannot
know
by
the
holy
spirit
its
always
like
that
nesvitsky
said
waving
his
hand
what
are
you
doing
here
he
turned
to
zherkov
the
same
as
you
youre
soaking
wet
though
let
me
wring
you
out
you
said
mister
staff
officer
the
colonel
went
on
in
an
offended
tone
colonel
the
officer
of
the
suite
interrupted
you
must
hurry
otherwise
the
enemy
will
move
up
his
canister
guns
the
colonel
looked
silently
at
the
officer
of
the
suite
at
the
fat
staff
officer
at
zherkov
and
frowned
i
vill
set
feuer
to
the
bridge
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
as
if
to
show
that
despite
all
the
unpleasantness
done
to
him
he
would
still
do
what
he
had
to
do
striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
as
if
it
was
all
the
horses
fault
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
commanded
the
second
squadron
the
one
in
which
rostov
served
under
denisov
to
go
back
to
the
bridge
well
thats
it
thought
rostov
he
wants
to
test
me
his
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
let
him
see
whether
im
a
coward
he
thought
again
there
appeared
on
all
the
cheerful
faces
of
the
men
of
the
squadron
that
serious
trait
that
had
been
there
when
they
were
under
fire
rostov
never
taking
his
eyes
away
kept
looking
at
his
enemy
the
regimental
commander
wishing
to
find
on
his
face
a
confirmation
of
his
surmises
but
the
colonel
never
once
glanced
at
rostov
but
as
always
at
the
front
looked
stern
and
solemn
the
command
was
heard
step
lively
step
lively
several
voices
said
near
him
their
sabers
catching
in
their
bridles
their
spurs
jingling
the
hussars
hurriedly
dismounted
not
knowing
themselves
what
they
were
going
to
do
the
hussars
crossed
themselves
rostov
no
longer
looked
at
the
regimental
commanderhe
had
no
time
he
was
afraid
with
a
sinking
heart
he
was
afraid
to
lag
behind
the
hussars
his
hand
shook
as
he
turned
his
horse
over
to
the
handler
and
he
felt
the
blood
throbbing
as
it
rose
to
his
heart
denisov
lurching
backwards
and
shouting
something
rode
past
him
rostov
saw
nothing
but
the
hussars
running
around
him
their
spurs
catching
and
their
sabers
clanking
stretcher
someones
voice
shouted
behind
rostov
did
not
think
of
what
the
call
for
a
stretcher
meant
he
ran
on
trying
only
to
be
ahead
of
everyone
else
but
just
by
the
bridge
not
looking
under
his
feet
he
got
into
the
slimy
trampled
mud
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
hands
others
ran
past
him
on
bote
sides
captain
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
regimental
commander
who
having
ridden
ahead
stood
mounted
near
the
bridge
with
a
triumphant
and
merry
face
rostov
wiping
his
muddy
hands
on
his
breeches
looked
at
his
enemy
and
wanted
to
run
further
supposing
that
the
further
ahead
he
got
the
better
it
would
be
but
bogdanych
though
he
neither
looked
at
nor
recognized
rostov
shouted
at
him
whos
that
running
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
keep
to
the
right
back
junker
he
cried
out
angrily
and
turned
to
denisov
who
flaunting
his
courage
rode
out
onto
the
planks
of
the
bridge
vy
riskiert
captain
better
dismount
said
the
colonel
eh
itll
find
the
one
its
meant
for
replied
denisov
turning
on
his
saddle
meanwhile
nesvitsky
zherkov
and
the
officer
of
the
suite
stood
together
out
of
the
range
of
fire
and
looking
at
this
small
bunch
of
men
in
yellow
shakos
dark
green
jackets
embroidered
with
cord
and
blue
breeches
pottering
about
by
the
bridge
and
on
the
other
side
at
blue
coats
and
groups
with
horses
which
could
easily
be
identified
as
artillery
approaching
in
the
distance
will
they
set
fire
to
it
or
wont
they
wholl
be
first
will
they
run
and
set
fire
to
the
bridge
or
will
the
french
come
within
canistershot
range
and
kill
them
all
these
questions
were
involuntarily
asked
with
sinking
heart
by
each
man
of
that
large
mass
of
troops
which
stood
above
the
bridge
and
in
the
bright
evening
light
looked
at
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
and
on
the
other
side
at
the
advancing
blue
coats
with
bayonets
and
guns
ah
the
hussars
are
going
to
get
it
said
nesvitsky
its
close
enough
for
canister
shot
now
he
shouldnt
have
taken
so
many
men
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
indeed
not
said
nesvitsky
if
hed
sent
two
brave
lads
it
would
be
the
same
ah
your
excellency
zherkov
mixed
in
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
hussars
but
still
with
his
na239ve
manner
which
made
it
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
was
speaking
seriously
or
not
ah
your
excellency
what
a
way
to
reason
send
two
men
and
whos
going
to
give
us
a
vladimir
with
a
bow
this
way
they
may
get
beaten
but
the
squadron
will
be
distinguished
and
hell
get
a
bow
our
bogdanych
knows
the
system
well
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
theres
the
canisters
he
pointed
to
the
french
guns
which
were
being
taken
from
their
limbers
and
hurriedly
deployed
on
the
french
side
among
those
groups
where
the
guns
were
a
puff
of
smoke
appeared
a
second
a
third
almost
simultaneously
and
just
as
the
sound
of
the
first
shot
reached
them
a
fourth
appeared
two
sounds
one
after
another
and
a
third
oh
oh
gasped
nesvitsky
as
if
from
burning
pain
seizing
the
officer
of
the
suite
by
the
arm
look
hes
fallen
one
of
them
has
fallen
fallen
two
of
them
i
believe
if
i
were
the
tsar
id
never
go
to
war
nesvitsky
said
turning
away
the
french
guns
were
being
hurriedly
reloaded
the
infantry
in
blue
coats
moved
towards
the
bridge
at
a
run
again
puffs
of
smoke
appeared
at
various
intervals
and
canister
shot
went
crackling
and
rattling
over
the
bridge
but
this
time
nesvitsky
could
not
see
what
was
happening
on
the
bridge
thick
smoke
rose
from
it
the
hussars
had
managed
to
set
fire
to
the
bridge
and
the
french
batteries
were
now
shooting
not
in
order
to
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
had
been
aimed
and
there
were
people
to
shoot
at
the
french
managed
to
fire
three
rounds
of
canister
shot
before
the
hussars
got
back
to
the
horsetenders
two
of
the
rounds
were
poorly
aimed
and
all
the
shot
went
overhead
but
the
last
round
landed
in
the
middle
of
a
bunch
of
hussars
and
brought
down
three
of
them
rostov
preoccupied
by
his
relations
with
bogdanych
stopped
on
the
bridge
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
himself
there
was
no
one
to
cut
down
as
he
had
always
pictured
battle
to
himself
nor
could
he
help
set
fire
to
the
bridge
because
unlike
the
other
soldiers
he
had
not
brought
a
plait
of
straw
with
him
he
was
standing
and
looking
about
when
suddenly
there
was
a
rattling
on
the
bridge
as
if
someone
had
spilled
nuts
and
one
of
the
hussars
the
one
nearest
him
fell
on
the
railing
with
a
groan
rostov
ran
to
him
with
the
others
again
someone
cried
stretcher
four
men
took
hold
of
the
hussar
and
began
to
lift
him
up
oooh
leave
me
alone
for
christs
sake
the
wounded
man
cried
but
all
the
same
they
lifted
him
up
and
laid
him
on
the
stretcher
nikolai
rostov
turned
away
and
as
if
searching
for
something
began
looking
at
the
distance
at
the
waters
of
the
danube
at
the
sky
at
the
sun
how
good
the
sky
seemed
how
blue
calm
and
deep
how
bright
and
solemn
the
setting
sun
how
tenderly
and
lustrously
glistened
the
waters
of
the
distant
danube
and
better
still
were
the
distant
blue
hills
beyond
the
danube
the
convent
the
mysterious
gorges
the
pine
forests
bathed
in
mist
to
their
topsthere
was
peace
happinesstheres
nothing
nothing
i
would
wish
for
theres
nothing
i
would
wish
for
if
only
i
were
there
thought
rostov
in
me
alone
and
in
this
sun
there
is
so
much
happiness
but
heregroans
suffering
fear
and
this
obscurity
this
hurryagain
theyre
shouting
something
and
again
everybodys
run
back
somewhere
and
im
running
with
them
and
here
it
is
here
it
is
death
above
me
around
mean
instant
and
ill
never
again
see
this
sun
this
water
this
gorge
just
then
the
sun
began
to
hide
itself
behind
the
clouds
ahead
of
rostov
another
stretcher
appeared
and
his
fear
of
death
and
the
stretcher
and
his
love
of
the
sun
and
lifeall
merged
into
one
painfully
disturbing
impression
lord
god
the
one
there
in
this
sky
save
forgive
and
protect
me
rostov
whispered
to
himself
the
hussars
ran
up
to
the
handlers
the
voices
became
louder
and
calmer
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
sight
what
brother
got
a
whiff
of
powder
denisovs
voice
shouted
by
his
ear
its
all
over
but
im
a
coward
yes
im
a
coward
thought
rostov
and
sighing
deeply
he
took
his
lame
little
rook
from
the
handler
and
began
to
mount
what
was
it
canister
shot
he
asked
denisov
and
then
some
shouted
denisov
good
work
lads
and
it
was
a
rotten
job
attackings
a
lovely
thing
cut
em
to
pieces
but
here
devil
knows
its
more
like
target
practice
and
denisov
rode
off
to
a
group
that
had
stopped
not
far
from
rostov
the
regimental
commander
nesvitsky
zherkov
and
the
officer
of
the
suite
however
it
seems
nobody
noticed
rostov
thought
to
himself
and
indeed
no
one
had
noticed
anything
because
they
were
all
familiar
with
the
feeling
a
junker
experiences
when
he
is
under
fire
for
the
first
time
therell
be
a
report
in
it
for
you
said
zherkov
just
see
if
i
dont
get
promoted
sublieutenant
inform
the
prince
that
i
haf
set
feuer
to
the
bridge
the
colonel
said
triumphantly
and
cheerfully
and
what
if
he
asks
about
the
losses
trifles
the
colonel
boomed
two
hussars
wounded
and
one
killed
on
the
spot
he
said
with
obvious
joy
unable
to
hold
back
a
happy
smile
sonorously
rapping
out
the
beautiful
phrase
killed
on
the
spot
ix
pursued
by
the
hundredthousandman
french
army
under
the
leadership
of
bonaparte
encountering
a
hostile
local
populace
no
longer
trusting
their
allies
suffering
from
a
shortness
of
supplies
and
forced
to
act
outside
all
foreseeable
conditions
of
war
the
thirtyfivethousandman
russian
army
under
the
leadership
of
kutuzov
hastily
retreated
down
the
danube
stopping
whenever
the
enemy
caught
up
with
it
and
fighting
rearguard
actions
only
insofar
as
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
retreat
without
loss
of
heavy
equipment
there
was
action
at
lambach
amstetten
and
m246lk
but
despite
the
courage
and
steadfastness
acknowledged
by
the
enemy
themselves
with
which
the
russians
fought
the
result
of
these
actions
was
only
a
still
speedier
retreat
the
austrian
troops
that
had
escaped
capture
at
ulm
and
joined
kutuzov
at
braunau
now
separated
from
the
russian
army
and
kutuzov
was
left
with
nothing
but
his
own
weak
exhausted
forces
to
defend
vienna
was
no
longer
thinkable
instead
of
the
offensive
war
profoundly
thought
out
according
to
the
laws
of
the
new
science
of
strategy
the
plan
of
which
had
been
given
to
kutuzov
while
in
vienna
by
the
austrian
hofkriegsrath
the
sole
almost
unattainable
goal
now
remaining
for
kutuzov
was
to
unite
with
the
troops
coming
from
russia
without
losing
his
own
army
as
mack
had
done
at
ulm
on
the
twentyeighth
of
october
kutuzov
crossed
with
his
army
to
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
and
halted
for
the
first
time
having
put
the
danube
between
himself
and
the
main
forces
of
the
french
on
the
thirtieth
he
attacked
mortiers
division
which
was
on
the
left
bank
of
the
danube
and
crushed
it
in
this
action
trophies
were
taken
for
the
first
time
a
banner
cannon
and
two
enemy
generals
for
the
first
time
after
a
twoweek
retreat
the
russian
troops
halted
and
after
the
fighting
not
only
held
the
field
of
battle
but
drove
the
french
away
despite
the
fact
that
the
troops
were
illclad
wornout
weakened
by
a
third
with
the
stragglers
the
wounded
the
dead
and
the
sick
despite
the
fact
that
the
sick
and
the
wounded
had
been
left
on
the
other
side
of
the
danube
with
a
letter
from
kutuzov
entrusting
them
to
the
humaneness
of
the
enemy
despite
the
fact
that
the
big
hospitals
and
the
houses
in
krems
that
had
been
turned
into
infirmaries
could
no
longer
accommodate
all
the
sick
and
woundeddespite
all
that
the
halt
at
krems
and
the
victory
over
mortier
raised
the
spirits
of
the
troops
significantly
throughout
the
army
and
in
headquarters
joyful
though
incorrect
rumors
were
rife
about
the
imaginary
approach
of
columns
from
russia
about
some
victory
won
by
the
austrians
and
about
the
retreat
of
the
frightened
bonaparte
at
the
time
of
the
battle
prince
andrei
was
attached
to
the
austrian
general
schmidt
killed
in
that
action
his
horse
had
been
shot
from
under
him
and
his
arm
had
been
slightly
grazed
by
a
bullet
as
a
sign
of
special
favor
the
commander
in
chief
had
sent
him
with
news
of
the
victory
to
the
austrian
court
no
longer
in
vienna
which
was
threatened
by
the
french
but
in
br252nn
on
the
night
of
the
battle
prince
andrei
agitated
but
not
tired
despite
his
apparently
slight
build
prince
andrei
could
endure
physical
fatigue
far
better
than
the
strongest
people
having
come
on
horseback
with
a
message
from
dokhturov
to
kutuzov
in
krems
was
sent
that
same
night
as
a
courier
to
br252nn
being
sent
as
a
courier
a
its
rewards
also
signified
an
important
step
towards
promotion
the
night
was
dark
starry
the
road
lay
black
amidst
the
white
snow
that
had
fallen
that
day
the
day
of
the
battle
now
going
over
his
impressions
of
the
past
battle
now
joyfully
imagining
the
impression
he
would
make
with
his
news
of
the
victory
recalling
his
leavetaking
from
the
commander
in
chief
and
his
comrades
prince
andrei
galloped
along
in
a
post
britzka
experiencing
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
has
long
been
awaiting
and
has
finally
achieved
the
beginning
of
the
happiness
he
desired
as
soon
as
he
closed
his
eyes
the
firing
of
muskets
and
cannon
resounded
in
his
ears
merging
with
the
rattle
of
the
carriage
and
the
impression
of
the
victory
now
he
would
begin
to
imagine
that
the
russians
were
fleeing
that
he
himself
had
been
killed
but
then
he
would
hurriedly
wake
up
and
happily
learn
as
if
for
the
first
time
that
none
of
it
had
happened
and
that
on
the
contrary
the
french
had
fled
he
would
recall
once
more
all
the
details
of
the
victory
his
calm
manliness
during
the
battle
and
reassured
would
doze
offafter
the
dark
starry
night
came
a
bright
cheerful
morning
the
snow
melted
in
the
sun
the
horses
galloped
swiftly
and
to
right
and
left
alike
passed
new
and
various
forests
fields
villages
at
one
of
the
posting
stations
he
overtook
a
convoy
carrying
russian
wounded
the
russian
officer
who
was
leading
the
transport
sprawled
in
the
front
cart
shouted
something
abusing
a
soldier
in
rude
terms
six
or
more
pale
bandaged
and
dirty
wounded
went
jolting
down
the
rocky
road
in
each
of
the
long
german
vorspanns
some
of
them
were
talking
he
heard
russian
speech
others
were
eating
bread
the
most
seriously
wounded
gazed
at
the
courier
galloping
past
them
silently
with
a
meek
and
sickly
childish
interest
prince
andrei
ordered
the
driver
to
stop
and
asked
the
soldiers
what
action
they
had
been
wounded
in
two
days
ago
on
the
danube
a
soldier
replied
prince
andrei
took
out
a
purse
and
gave
the
soldier
three
gold
pieces
for
all
of
you
he
added
addressing
the
approaching
officer
get
well
lads
he
said
to
the
soldiers
theres
still
a
lot
to
be
done
well
mister
adjutant
what
news
asked
the
officer
obviously
wishing
to
strike
up
a
conversation
good
newsdrive
on
he
cried
to
the
coachman
and
galloped
on
his
way
it
was
already
quite
dark
when
prince
andrei
drove
into
br252nn
and
saw
himself
surrounded
by
tall
buildings
lighted
shops
windows
street
lamps
fine
carriages
noisily
driving
over
the
pavement
and
all
the
atmosphere
of
a
big
lively
town
which
is
always
so
attractive
for
a
military
man
after
camp
life
prince
andrei
despite
the
quick
driving
and
the
sleepless
night
felt
himself
still
more
animated
than
the
day
before
as
he
pulled
up
to
the
palace
only
his
eyes
shone
with
a
feverish
gleam
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
speed
and
clarity
he
vividly
pictured
again
all
the
details
of
the
battle
not
vaguely
now
but
in
the
welldefined
concise
account
which
in
his
imagination
he
was
giving
to
the
emperor
franz
he
vividly
pictured
the
casual
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
and
the
answers
he
would
give
to
them
he
supposed
that
he
would
be
presented
to
the
emperor
at
once
but
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
palace
an
official
came
running
out
to
him
and
recognizing
that
he
was
a
courier
led
him
to
another
entrance
to
the
right
from
the
corridor
there
euer
hochgeboren
you
will
find
the
imperial
adjutant
on
duty
said
the
official
he
will
take
you
to
the
minister
of
war
the
imperial
adjutant
on
duty
meeting
prince
andrei
asked
him
to
wait
and
went
to
the
minister
of
war
five
minutes
later
the
imperial
adjutant
returned
and
inclining
with
particular
courtesy
and
letting
prince
andrei
go
ahead
of
him
led
him
down
the
corridor
to
the
office
where
the
minister
of
war
worked
the
imperial
adjutant
seemed
to
want
to
protect
himself
from
any
attempts
at
familiarity
from
the
russian
adjutant
prince
andreis
joyful
feeling
weakened
significantly
as
he
approached
the
doors
of
the
minister
of
wars
office
he
felt
offended
and
the
feeling
of
offense
turned
that
same
instant
without
his
noticing
it
into
a
feeling
of
totally
groundless
scorn
his
resourceful
mind
suggested
to
him
that
same
instant
the
point
of
view
from
which
he
had
the
right
to
scorn
both
the
adjutant
and
the
minister
of
war
to
him
it
must
seem
very
easy
to
win
a
victory
having
never
had
a
whiff
of
powder
he
thought
his
eyes
narrowed
scornfully
he
entered
the
minister
of
wars
office
especially
slowly
this
feeling
increased
still
more
when
he
saw
the
minister
of
war
sitting
at
the
big
desk
and
for
the
first
two
minutes
paying
no
attention
to
the
one
who
had
entered
the
minister
of
war
had
lowered
his
bald
head
with
gray
temples
between
two
wax
candles
and
was
reading
some
papers
making
notes
with
a
pencil
he
went
on
reading
to
the
end
without
raising
his
head
when
the
door
opened
and
footsteps
were
heard
take
this
and
deliver
it
the
minister
of
war
said
to
his
adjutant
handing
him
the
papers
and
still
paying
no
attention
to
the
courier
prince
andrei
felt
that
either
of
all
the
matters
that
occupied
the
minister
of
war
the
actions
of
kutuzovs
army
must
interest
him
the
least
or
that
he
had
to
give
the
russian
courier
that
feeling
but
its
all
quite
the
same
to
me
he
thought
the
minister
of
war
put
the
rest
of
the
papers
together
stacked
them
evenly
and
raised
his
head
he
had
an
intelligent
and
characteristic
head
but
the
moment
he
turned
to
prince
andrei
the
intelligent
and
firm
expression
on
the
minister
of
wars
face
changed
evidently
habitually
and
consciously
there
remained
on
his
face
the
stupid
feigned
smile
which
did
not
conceal
its
feigning
of
a
man
who
receives
many
petitioners
one
after
the
other
from
general
field
marshal
kutuzov
he
asked
with
good
news
i
hope
there
was
an
encounter
with
mortier
a
victory
about
time
he
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
to
him
and
began
reading
it
with
a
sorrowful
expression
ah
my
god
my
god
schmidt
he
said
in
german
what
a
misfortune
what
a
misfortune
having
looked
through
the
dispatch
he
put
it
on
the
table
and
glanced
at
prince
andrei
clearly
weighing
something
ah
what
a
misfortune
you
say
it
was
a
decisive
action
mortier
wasnt
taken
however
he
reflected
im
very
glad
youve
come
with
good
news
though
schmidts
death
is
a
high
price
for
a
victory
his
majesty
will
certainly
wish
to
see
you
but
not
today
thank
you
get
some
rest
be
at
the
levee
tomorrow
after
the
parade
ill
let
you
know
however
the
stupid
smile
that
had
disappeared
during
the
conversation
reappeared
on
the
minister
of
wars
face
goodbye
thank
you
very
much
the
sovereign
emperor
will
probably
wish
to
see
you
he
repeated
and
inclined
his
head
when
prince
andrei
left
the
palace
he
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
happiness
afforded
him
by
the
victory
had
now
left
him
and
been
given
over
into
the
indifferent
hands
of
the
minister
of
war
and
the
courteous
adjutant
his
whole
way
of
thinking
changed
instantly
the
battle
appeared
to
him
now
as
a
longpast
faroff
memory
x
prince
andrei
stayed
in
br252nn
with
his
acquaintance
the
russian
diplomat
bilibin
ah
dear
prince
theres
no
guest
more
welcome
said
bilibin
coming
out
to
meet
prince
andrei
franz
take
the
princes
things
to
my
bedroom
he
turned
to
the
servant
who
accompanied
bolkonsky
what
are
you
a
herald
of
victory
excellent
and
im
sitting
here
sick
as
you
see
prince
andrei
having
washed
and
dressed
came
out
to
the
diplomats
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
to
the
prepared
dinner
bilibin
settled
comfortably
by
the
fireplace
not
only
after
his
trip
but
after
the
whole
campaign
during
which
he
had
been
deprived
of
all
the
comforts
of
cleanliness
and
the
refinements
of
life
prince
andrei
experienced
the
pleasant
feeling
of
repose
amidst
the
luxurious
conditions
of
life
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
since
childhood
besides
it
was
pleasant
for
him
after
his
austrian
reception
to
speak
if
not
russian
they
spoke
french
at
least
with
a
russian
man
who
he
supposed
shared
the
general
russian
aversion
now
especially
sharply
felt
to
the
austrians
bilibin
was
a
man
of
about
thirtyfive
a
bachelor
of
the
same
society
as
prince
andrei
they
had
been
acquainted
back
in
petersburg
but
had
become
more
closely
acquainted
during
prince
andreis
visit
to
vienna
with
kutuzov
as
prince
andrei
was
a
young
man
who
promised
to
go
far
in
his
military
career
so
and
still
more
was
bilibin
promising
in
the
diplomacy
he
was
still
a
young
man
but
no
longer
a
young
diplomat
since
he
had
begun
to
serve
at
the
age
of
sixteen
had
been
in
paris
in
copenhagen
and
now
occupied
a
rather
important
post
in
vienna
both
the
chancellor
and
our
ambassador
in
vienna
knew
him
and
valued
him
he
did
not
belong
to
that
large
number
of
diplomats
whose
duty
it
is
to
have
only
negative
merits
to
not
do
certain
things
and
to
speak
french
so
as
to
be
very
good
diplomats
he
was
one
of
those
diplomats
who
like
and
know
how
to
work
and
despite
his
laziness
he
occasionally
spent
nights
at
his
desk
he
worked
equally
well
whatever
the
essence
of
the
work
consisted
of
he
was
interested
not
in
the
question
why
but
in
the
question
how
what
the
diplomatic
business
consisted
of
made
no
difference
to
him
but
to
compose
a
circular
a
memorandum
a
report
artfully
aptly
and
elegantlyin
that
he
took
great
pleasure
bilibins
merits
were
valued
a
his
written
work
also
for
his
skill
at
moving
and
speaking
in
higher
spheres
bilibin
liked
conversation
just
as
he
liked
work
only
when
the
conversation
could
be
elegantly
witty
in
society
he
constantly
waited
for
the
opportunity
to
say
something
remarkable
and
entered
into
conversation
not
otherwise
than
on
that
condition
bilibins
conversation
was
constantly
sprinkled
with
wittily
original
and
wellturned
phrases
of
general
interest
these
phrases
were
manufactured
in
bilibins
inner
laboratory
as
if
intentionally
of
a
portable
nature
so
that
society
nonentities
could
readily
remember
them
and
pass
them
on
from
drawing
room
to
drawing
room
and
indeed
les
mots
de
bilibine
se
colportaient
dans
les
salons
de
vienne
as
they
say
and
often
had
an
influence
on
socalled
important
affairs
his
thin
drawn
yellowish
face
was
all
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
which
always
looked
as
neatly
and
thoroughly
washed
as
ones
fingertips
after
a
bath
the
movements
of
these
wrinkles
constituted
the
main
play
of
his
physiognomy
now
his
forehead
would
wrinkle
into
wide
folds
as
his
eyebrows
rose
then
his
eyebrows
would
descend
and
deep
wrinkles
would
form
on
his
cheeks
his
small
deepset
eyes
always
looked
out
directly
and
merrily
well
now
tell
us
about
your
exploits
he
said
in
a
most
modest
way
not
once
mentioning
himself
bolkonsky
told
about
the
action
and
his
reception
by
the
minister
of
war
ils
mont
re231u
avec
ma
nouvelle
comme
un
chien
dans
un
jeu
de
quilles
he
concluded
bilibin
smiled
and
released
the
folds
of
his
skin
cependant
mon
cher
he
said
studying
his
fingernail
from
a
distance
and
gathering
up
the
skin
over
his
left
eye
malgr233
la
haute
estime
que
je
professe
pour
le
orthodox
russian
armed
forcesjavoue
que
votre
victoire
nest
pas
des
plus
victorieuses
he
went
on
in
the
same
way
in
french
pronouncing
in
russian
only
those
words
he
wanted
to
underscore
contemptuously
how
then
with
all
your
mass
you
fell
upon
the
unfortunate
mortier
with
his
one
division
and
this
mortier
slips
between
your
fingers
wheres
the
victory
all
the
same
seriously
speaking
replied
prince
andrei
we
can
still
say
without
boasting
that
this
is
a
bit
better
than
ulm
why
didnt
you
capture
us
at
least
one
at
least
one
marshal
because
not
everything
goes
as
its
supposed
to
and
with
such
regularity
as
on
parade
we
planned
as
i
told
you
to
attack
their
rear
by
seven
in
the
morning
but
we
didnt
even
get
there
by
five
in
the
afternoon
but
why
didnt
you
get
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
you
had
to
get
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
bilibin
said
smiling
you
had
to
get
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
why
didnt
you
convince
bonaparte
through
diplomatic
channels
that
hed
better
leave
genoa
prince
andrei
said
in
the
same
tone
i
know
bilibin
interrupted
you
think
its
very
easy
to
capture
marshals
while
sitting
on
a
sofa
in
front
of
a
fireplace
thats
true
but
even
so
why
didnt
you
capture
him
and
dont
be
surprised
if
not
only
the
minister
of
war
but
the
most
august
emperor
and
king
franz
is
not
made
very
happy
by
your
victory
nor
do
i
a
miserable
secretary
of
the
russian
embassy
feel
any
particular
joy
he
looked
straight
at
prince
andrei
and
suddenly
relaxed
all
the
skin
gathered
on
his
forehead
now
its
my
turn
to
ask
you
why
my
dear
said
bolkonsky
i
confess
to
you
that
i
dont
understand
maybe
there
are
diplomatic
subtleties
here
that
are
beyond
my
feeble
mind
but
i
dont
understand
mack
loses
a
whole
army
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
the
archduke
karl
give
no
signs
of
life
and
make
blunder
after
blunder
kutuzov
alone
finally
gains
a
real
victory
destroys
the
charme
of
the
french
and
the
minister
of
war
isnt
even
interested
in
learning
the
details
precisely
for
that
reason
my
dear
voyezvous
mon
cher
hurrah
for
the
tsar
for
rus
for
the
faith
tout
231a
est
bel
et
bon
but
what
do
wei
mean
the
austrian
courtcare
about
your
victories
bring
us
some
nice
little
news
about
a
victory
of
the
archduke
karl
or
ferdinandun
archiduc
vaut
lautre
as
you
knoweven
over
a
fire
brigade
of
bonapartes
and
that
will
be
a
different
story
well
shoot
off
all
our
cannons
whereas
this
as
if
on
purpose
can
only
exasperate
us
the
archduke
karl
does
nothing
the
archduke
ferdinand
covers
himself
in
shame
you
abandon
vienna
you
no
longer
protect
it
comme
si
vous
disiez
god
is
with
us
and
god
help
you
and
your
capital
there
was
one
general
we
all
loved
schmidt
you
put
him
in
the
path
of
a
bullet
and
congratulate
us
with
your
victoryyou
must
agree
that
to
think
up
more
exasperating
news
than
what
youve
brought
would
be
impossible
cest
comme
un
fait
expr233s
comme
un
fait
expr233s
besides
that
well
if
you
were
to
gain
a
truly
brilliant
victory
if
the
archduke
karl
were
even
to
gain
a
victory
what
would
it
change
in
the
general
course
of
affairs
its
too
late
now
since
viennas
occupied
by
french
troops
occupied
vienna
occupied
not
only
occupied
but
bonaparte
is
in
sch246nbrunn
and
the
count
our
dear
count
vrbna
is
going
to
him
for
orders
after
the
fatigues
and
impressions
of
the
journey
the
reception
and
especially
after
dinner
bolkonsky
felt
that
he
did
not
quite
understand
the
full
significance
of
the
words
he
had
heard
this
morning
count
lichtenfels
was
here
bilibin
went
on
and
he
showed
me
a
letter
which
described
in
detail
the
parade
of
the
french
in
vienna
le
prince
murat
et
tout
le
tremblement
you
see
that
your
victory
doesnt
bring
much
joy
and
that
you
cant
be
received
as
a
savior
really
its
all
the
same
to
me
all
quite
the
same
said
prince
andrei
beginning
to
realize
that
his
news
about
the
battle
at
krems
was
indeed
of
little
importance
in
view
of
such
events
as
the
occupation
of
the
capital
of
austria
how
is
it
that
viennas
been
taken
what
about
the
bridge
and
the
famous
t234te
de
pont
and
prince
auersperg
there
was
a
rumor
among
us
that
prince
auersperg
was
defending
vienna
he
said
prince
auersperg
is
standing
on
this
side
our
side
and
defending
us
i
suppose
hes
defending
us
very
poorly
but
still
hes
defending
us
but
vienna
is
on
the
other
side
no
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
i
hope
will
not
be
taken
because
its
mined
and
theres
an
order
to
blow
it
up
otherwise
wed
have
been
in
the
mountains
of
bohemia
long
ago
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
between
two
fires
that
still
doesnt
mean
the
campaign
is
over
said
prince
andrei
but
i
think
its
over
and
the
bigwigs
here
think
so
too
though
they
dont
dare
say
it
it
will
turn
out
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
that
the
matter
wont
be
decided
by
your
233chauffour233e
de
d252renstein
nor
by
gunpowder
but
by
those
who
invented
gunpowder
said
bilibin
repeating
one
of
his
mots
releasing
the
skin
on
his
forehead
and
pausing
the
only
question
is
what
the
meeting
in
berlin
between
the
emperor
alexander
and
the
king
of
prussia
will
tell
us
if
prussia
enters
the
alliance
on
forcera
la
main
224
lautriche
and
there
will
be
war
if
not
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
arranging
where
to
draw
up
the
preliminary
articles
for
a
new
campo
formio
but
what
an
extraordinary
genius
prince
andrei
cried
suddenly
clenching
his
small
fist
and
pounding
it
on
the
table
and
what
luck
the
man
has
buonaparte
bilibin
said
questioningly
wrinkling
his
forehead
and
with
that
letting
it
be
felt
that
a
mot
was
coming
buonaparte
he
said
with
special
emphasis
on
the
u
i
think
however
that
now
that
hes
prescribing
laws
for
austria
from
sch246nbrunn
il
faut
lui
faire
gr226ce
de
lu
i
decidedly
make
an
innovation
and
call
him
bonaparte
tout
court
no
joking
aside
said
prince
andrei
do
you
really
think
the
campaign
is
over
heres
what
i
think
austrias
been
played
for
a
fool
and
shes
not
used
to
it
and
shell
pay
it
back
shes
been
played
for
a
fool
because
first
the
provinces
are
devastated
on
dit
le
orthodox
army
est
terrible
pour
le
pillage
her
army
is
destroyed
her
capital
has
been
taken
and
all
that
pour
les
beaux
yeux
du
his
sardinian
majesty
and
thereforeentre
nous
mon
cher
i
feel
instinctively
that
were
being
deceived
i
feel
instinctively
that
communications
with
france
and
plans
for
peace
a
secret
peace
are
being
concluded
separately
that
cant
be
said
prince
andrei
it
would
be
too
vile
qui
vivra
verra
said
bilibin
again
releasing
his
skin
as
a
sign
that
the
conversation
was
over
when
prince
andrei
went
to
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
lay
down
on
the
featherbed
and
fragrant
warmedup
pillows
in
clean
linenhe
felt
that
the
battle
the
news
of
which
he
had
brought
was
far
far
away
from
him
the
prussian
alliance
the
treachery
of
austria
the
new
triumph
of
bonaparte
the
levee
and
the
parade
and
his
reception
by
the
emperor
franz
the
next
day
preoccupied
him
he
closed
his
eyes
but
at
that
same
instant
in
his
ears
there
crackled
a
cannonade
gunfire
the
rattle
of
carriage
wheels
and
now
again
the
stretchedout
line
of
musketeers
goes
down
the
hill
and
the
french
are
shooting
and
he
feels
his
heart
thrill
and
he
is
riding
in
front
next
to
schmidt
and
bullets
are
whistling
merrily
around
him
and
he
experiences
that
feeling
of
the
tenfold
joy
of
life
such
as
he
has
not
experienced
since
childhood
he
woke
up
yes
all
that
happened
he
said
smiling
happily
to
himself
like
a
child
and
he
fell
into
a
sound
youthful
sleep
xi
the
next
day
he
woke
up
late
going
over
his
recent
impressions
he
remembered
first
of
all
that
he
had
to
present
himself
to
the
emperor
franz
that
day
remembered
the
minister
of
war
the
courteous
austrian
imperial
adjutant
bilibin
and
the
conversation
yesterday
evening
putting
on
his
full
dress
uniform
which
he
had
not
worn
in
a
long
time
for
his
trip
to
the
palace
fresh
animated
and
handsome
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
he
went
into
bilibins
study
in
the
study
there
were
four
gentlemen
from
the
diplomatic
corps
bolkonsky
was
acquainted
with
prince
ippolit
kuragin
who
was
a
secretary
at
the
embassy
bilibin
introduced
him
to
the
others
the
gentlemen
who
frequented
bilibin
young
rich
and
merry
society
people
constituted
here
as
in
vienna
a
separate
circle
which
bilibin
who
was
the
head
of
it
called
oursles
n244tres
this
circle
made
up
almost
exclusively
of
diplomats
clearly
had
its
own
highsociety
interests
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
war
and
politics
interests
in
relations
with
certain
women
and
in
the
administrative
side
of
their
service
these
gentlemen
received
prince
andrei
into
their
circle
with
apparent
eagerness
as
theirs
an
honor
they
accorded
to
few
out
of
courtesy
and
as
a
subject
for
getting
into
conversation
he
was
asked
several
questions
about
the
army
and
the
battle
and
the
conversation
again
broke
up
into
inconsequentially
merry
jokes
and
gossip
but
it
was
especially
nice
one
said
telling
about
a
fellow
diplomats
failure
it
was
especially
nice
that
the
chancellor
told
him
straight
out
that
his
appointment
to
london
was
a
promotion
and
that
he
should
look
at
it
as
such
can
you
picture
his
face
when
he
heard
that
but
whats
worst
of
all
gentlemenim
betraying
kuragin
to
youis
that
the
man
is
in
misfortune
and
this
don
juan
this
terrible
fellow
is
taking
advantage
of
it
prince
ippolit
was
lying
in
a
voltaire
armchair
his
legs
thrown
over
the
armrest
he
laughed
parlezmoi
de
231a
he
said
oh
you
don
juan
oh
you
serpent
said
various
voices
you
dont
know
bolkonsky
bilibin
turned
to
prince
andrei
that
all
the
horrors
of
the
french
army
i
almost
said
the
russian
army
are
nothing
compared
to
what
this
man
has
been
doing
among
the
women
la
femme
est
la
compagne
de
lhomme
uttered
prince
ippolit
and
he
began
examining
his
raised
feet
through
his
lorgnette
bilibin
and
ours
burst
out
laughing
looking
ippolit
in
the
eye
prince
andrei
saw
that
this
ippolit
of
whom
he
it
had
to
be
admitted
had
almost
been
jealous
over
his
wife
was
the
buffoon
of
the
company
no
i
must
treat
you
to
kuragin
bilibin
said
softly
to
bolkonsky
hes
charming
when
he
argues
about
politics
you
should
see
such
gravity
he
sat
beside
ippolit
and
gathering
the
folds
of
his
forehead
began
a
conversation
about
politics
with
him
prince
andrei
and
the
others
stood
around
them
le

began
looking
around
significantly
at

seizing
him
by

and
he
let
go

bolkonskys
arm
thus
indicating
that
he
was
quite
finished

said
bilibin
whose
shock
of
hair
moved
on
his
head
with
pleasure
they
all
laughed
ippolit
laughed
more
than
anyone
else
he
obviously
suffered
choked
but
was
unable
to
hold
back
the
wild
laughter
that
distended
his
ever
immobile
face
well
i
tell
you
what
gentlemen
said
bilibin
bolkonsky
is
a
guest
in
my
house
and
here
in
br252nn
and
i
want
to
treat
him
as
far
as
i
can
to
all
the
joys
of
life
here
if
we
were
in
vienna
that
would
be
easy
but
here

its
harder
and
i
ask
you
all
to
help

youll
take
the
theater
upon
yourselves
ill
take
society
and
you
ippolit
naturally
the
women
we
must
show
him
am233liecharming
said
one
of
ours
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
generally
this
bloodthirsty
soldier
said
bilibin
needs
to
be
converted
to
more
humane
views
its
unlikely
that
ill
take
advantage
of
your
hospitality
gentlemen
and
its
now
time
for
me
to
go
bolkonsky
said
glancing
at
his
watch
where
to
the
emperor
oh
oh
oh
well
goodbye
bolkonsky
goodbye
prince
come
early
to
dinner
said
several
voices
well
take
good
care
of
you
try
to
praise
the
order
for
the
delivery
of
provisions
and
the
itineraries
as
much
as
possible
to
the
emperor
said
bilibin
seeing
bolkonsky
off
to
the
front
hall
i
wish
i
could
but
i
cant
as
far
as
i
know
bolkonsky
replied
smiling
well
generally
talk
as
much
as
possible
audiences
are
his
passion
but
he
neither
likes
nor
is
able
to
talk
himself
as
youll
see
xii
at
the
levee
the
emperor
franz
merely
looked
intently
into
the
face
of
prince
andrei
who
was
standing
in
the
place
assigned
to
him
among
the
austrian
officers
and
nodded
his
long
head
at
him
but
after
the
levee
yesterdays
imperial
adjutant
courteously
conveyed
to
bolkonsky
the
emperors
wish
to
grant
him
an
audience
the
emperor
franz
received
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
before
the
conversation
began
it
struck
prince
andrei
that
the
emperor
was
as
if
confused
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
blushed
tell
me
when
did
the
battle
begin
he
asked
hastily
prince
andrei
replied
after
that
question
other
equally
simple
questions
followed
was
kutuzov
in
good
health
how
long
ago
had
he
left
krems
and
so
on
the
emperor
spoke
with
such
an
expression
as
if
his
whole
goal
consisted
in
asking
a
certain
number
of
questions
the
replies
to
these
questions
as
was
only
too
clear
were
of
no
interest
to
him
at
what
time
did
the
battle
begin
asked
the
emperor
i
am
unable
to
tell
your
majesty
at
what
time
the
battle
at
the
front
began
but
in
d252renstein
where
i
was
the
troops
went
into
attack
between
five
and
six
oclock
in
the
evening
said
bolkonsky
livening
up
and
supposing
on
this
occasion
that
he
would
be
able
to
present
the
truthful
description
already
prepared
in
his
head
of
all
he
knew
and
had
seen
but
the
emperor
smiled
and
interrupted
him
how
many
miles
from
where
to
where
your
majesty
from
d252renstein
to
krems
three
and
a
half
miles
your
majesty
have
the
french
abandoned
the
left
bank
according
to
the
scouts
reports
the
last
of
them
crossed
at
night
on
rafts
is
there
enough
forage
in
krems
forage
was
not
delivered
in
the
quantities
the
emperor
interrupted
him
at
what
time
was
general
schmidt
killed
at
seven
oclock
i
believe
at
seven
oclock
very
sad
very
sad
the
emperor
said
that
he
thanked
him
and
inclined
his
head
prince
andrei
went
out
and
was
at
once
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
courtiers
on
all
sides
affectionate
eyes
looked
at
him
and
affectionate
words
came
to
him
yesterdays
imperial
adjutant
reproached
him
for
not
staying
in
the
palace
and
offered
him
his
own
house
the
minister
of
war
came
up
to
congratulate
him
on
the
order
of
maria
theresa
of
the
third
degree
which
the
emperor
was
to
bestow
on
him
the
empresss
chamberlain
invited
him
to
her
majesty
the
archduchess
also
wanted
to
see
him
he
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
and
needed
a
few
seconds
to
collect
his
wits
the
russian
ambassador
took
him
by
the
shoulder
led
him
to
the
window
and
started
talking
to
him
contrary
to
what
bilibin
had
said
the
news
he
brought
was
received
joyfully
a
thanksgiving
prayer
service
was
ordered
kutuzov
was
awarded
a
maria
theresa
with
large
cross
and
the
whole
army
received
rewards
bolkonsky
received
invitations
from
all
sides
and
had
to
spend
the
whole
morning
paying
visits
to
the
high
dignitaries
of
austria
having
finished
his
visits
past
four
in
the
afternoon
mentally
composing
a
letter
to
his
father
about
the
battle
and
his
journey
to
br252nn
prince
andrei
was
returning
home
to
bilibins
before
going
to
bilibins
prince
andrei
had
gone
to
a
bookstore
to
stock
up
on
books
for
the
campaign
and
had
spent
a
long
time
there
by
the
porch
of
the
house
occupied
by
bilibin
stood
a
britzka
half
filled
with
things
and
franz
bilibins
servant
dragging
a
trunk
with
difficulty
came
out
the
door
whats
this
asked
bolkonsky
ach
erlaucht
said
franz
loading
the
trunk
into
the
britzka
with
difficulty
wir

schon
wieder
hinter

her
what
is
it
what
prince
andrei
kept
asking
bilibin
came
out
to
meet
bolkonsky
the
usually
calm
face
of
bilibin
was
troubled
non
non
avouez
que
cest
charmant
he
was
saying
cette
histoire
du
pont
de

a
bridge
in
vienna
ils

pass233
sans

f233rir
prince
andrei
understood
nothing
but
where
are
you
coming
from
that
you
dont
know
what
every
coachman
in
town
already
knows
im
coming
from
the
archduchess
i
didnt
hear
anything
there
and
you
didnt
see
people
packing
up
everywhere
no
i
didntbut
whats
it
all
about
prince
andrei
asked
impatiently
whats
it
all
about
its
about
the
french
having
crossed
the
bridge
defended
by
auersperg
and
the
bridge
wasnt
blown
up
so
murat
is
now
racing
down
the
road
to
br252nn
and
theyll
be
here
today
or
tomorrow
what
do
you
mean
here
how
is
it
they
didnt
blow
up
the
bridge
since
its
mined
thats
what
im
asking
nobody
knows
not
even
bonaparte
himself
bolkonsky
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
if
the
bridge
has
been
crossed
that
means
the
army
is
lost
it
will
be
cut
off
he
said
thats
just
the
thing
answered
bilibin
listen
the
french
enter
vienna
as
i
said
everythings
fine
the
next
day
that
is
yesterday
the
gentlemen
marshals
murat
lannes
and
belliard
get
on
their
horses
and
set
out
for
the
bridge
note
that
all
three
are
gascons
gentlemen
says
one
you
know
that
the
bridge
of
thabor
has
been
mined
and
countermined
and
that
in
front
of
it
is
a
terrible
t234te
de
pont
and
fifteen
thousand
troops
who
have
been
ordered
to
blow
up
the
bridge
and
not
let
us
onto
it
but
it
will
be
pleasing
to
our
sovereign
emperor
napoleon
if
we
take
this
bridge
lets
go
the
three
of
us
and
take
the
bridge
lets
go
say
the
others
and
they
go
and
take
the
bridge
cross
it
and
are
now
on
this
side
of
the
danube
with
their
whole
army
coming
against
us
against
you
and
your
communications
enough
joking
prince
andrei
said
sadly
and
seriously
this
news
was
grievous
and
at
the
same
time
pleasant
for
prince
andrei
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
russian
army
was
in
such
a
hopeless
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
precisely
he
who
was
destined
to
lead
the
russian
army
out
of
that
situation
that
here
was
that
toulon
which
would
take
him
out
of
the
ranks
of
unknown
officers
and
open
for
him
the
first
path
to
glory
listening
to
bilibin
he
was
already
considering
how
on
coming
to
the
army
he
would
submit
an
opinion
at
the
military
council
which
alone
would
save
the
army
and
how
he
alone
would
be
charged
with
carrying
out
this
plan
enough
joking
he
said
im
not
joking
bilibin
went
on
nothing
is
more
true
or
sad
these
gentlemen
come
to
the
bridge
by
themselves
and
wave
white
handkerchiefs
assure
them
all
that
a
truce
has
been
called
and
that
they
the
marshals
are
coming
to
negotiate
with
prince
auersperg
the
officer
on
duty
lets
them
into
the
t234te
de
pont
they
tell
him
a
thousand
gascon
absurdities
that
the
war
is
over
that
the
emperor
franz
has
fixed
a
meeting
with
bonaparte
that
they
wish
to
see
prince
auersperg
and
so
on
the
officer
sends
for
auersperg
these
gentlemen
embrace
the
officers
joke
sit
on
the
cannons
and
meanwhile
a
french
battalion
gets
onto
the
bridge
unnoticed
throws
the
sacks
of
flammable
material
into
the
water
and
approaches
the
t234te
de
pont
finally
the
lieutenant
general
himself
comes
our
dear
prince
auersperg
von
mautern
our
dear
enemy
flower
of
the
austrian
military
hero
of
the
turkish
wars
the
hostilities
are
over
we
can
shake
hands
with
each
otherthe
emperor
napoleon
is
burning
with
desire
to
meet
prince
auersperg
in
short
these
men
arent
gascons
for
nothing
they
so
shower
auersperg
with
beautiful
words
hes
so
charmed
by
his
quickly
established
intimacy
with
the
french
marshals
so
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
murats
mantle
and
ostrich
feathers
quil
ny
voit
que
du
feu
et
oublie
celui
quil
devait
faire
faire
sur
lennemi
despite
the
animation
of
his
speech
bilibin
did
not
forget
to
pause
after
this
mot
to
allow
time
for
it
to
be
appreciated
the
french
battalion
rushes
into
the
t234te
de
pont
spikes
the
cannons
and
the
bridge
is
taken
no
but
the
best
thing
of
all
he
went
on
his
excitement
with
his
own
charming
story
subsiding
is
that
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
cannon
that
was
to
give
the
signal
to
ignite
the
mines
and
blow
up
the
bridge
this
sergeant
seeing
that
french
troops
were
running
onto
the
bridge
was
about
to
fire
but
lannes
pushed
his
hand
away
the
sergeant
who
was
clearly
smarter
than
his
general
goes
up
to
auersperg
and
says
prince
you
are
deceived
the
french
are
here
murat
sees
that
the
game
is
up
if
the
sergeant
is
allowed
to
speak
with
feigned
astonishment
a
real
gascon
he
turns
to
auersperg
where
is
that
austrian
discipline
the
world
praises
so
much
he
says
if
you
allow
the
lower
ranks
to
speak
to
you
like
that

vividly
imagining

the
sounds
of

and
the

that
awaited
him

cest

224
ulm
it
was
as
if
he
fell
to
pondering
searching
for
a
phrase
cestcest
du
mack
nous
somme
mack233s
he
concluded
feeling
that
he
had
uttered
a
mot
and
a
fresh
mot
a
mot
that
would
be
repeated
the
folds
on
his
forehead
gathered
till
then
quickly
released
themselves
as
a
sign
of
satisfaction
and
smiling
slightly
he
began
to
examine
his
nails
where
are
you
going
he
said
suddenly
turning
to
prince
andrei
who
got
up
and
made
for
his
room
im
leaving
for
where
the
army
why
didnt
you
want
to
stay
another
two
days
but
now
im
leaving
at
once
and
prince
andrei
having
given
orders
for
his
departure
left
for
his
room
you
know
what
my
dear
said
bilibin
coming
into
his
room
ive
been
thinking
about
you
why
should
you
go
and
in
proof
of
the
irrefutability
of
his
argument
all
the
folds
fled
his
face
prince
andrei
looked
at
his
interlocutor
questioningly
and
said
nothing
why
should
you
go
i
know
you
think
its
your
duty
to
gallop
off
to
the
army
now
that
the
army
is
in
danger
i
understand
that
mon
cher
cest
de
lh233roisme
not
in
the
least
said
prince
andrei
but
you
are
un
philosophe
so
be
one
fully
look
at
things
from
another
angle
and
youll
see
that
your
duty
is
on
the
contrary
to
protect
yourself
let
others
who
are
good
for
nothing
else
do
thatyou
werent
told
to
come
back
and
you
havent
been
dismissed
from
here
therefore
you
can
stay
and
come
with
us
wherever
our
sorry
fate
takes
us
they
say
theyre
going
to
olm252tz
now
olm252tz
is
a
very
nice
town
and
you
and
i
can
calmly
drive
there
together
in
my
carriage
stop
joking
bilibin
said
bolkonsky
im
saying
it
to
you
sincerely
as
a
friend
consider
where
will
you
go
now
and
what
for
when
you
can
stay
here
one
of
two
things
awaits
you
he
gathered
the
skin
over
his
left
temple
either
peace
will
be
concluded
before
you
reach
the
army
or
it
will
be
defeat
and
disgrace
along
with
the
whole
of
kutuzovs
army
and
bilibin
released

that
same
night
having
repectfully
taken
leave
of
the
minister
of

bolkonsky
rode
off
to
the
army
not
knowing
himself
where
he
would
find
it
and
fearing
to
be
intercepted
by
the
french
on
his
way
to
krems
in

all
the
court
population
was
packing
and
the
heavy
baggage
had
already
been
sent
to

near
etzelsdorf
prince
andrei
came
out
on
the
road
along
which
the
russian
army
was
moving
with
the
greatest
haste
and
in
the
greatest
disorder
the
road
was
so
choked
with
wagons
that
it
was
impossible
to
drive
in
a
carriage
having
taken
a
horse
and
a
cossack
from
the
chief
of
the
cossacks
prince
andrei
hungry
and
tired
got
ahead
of
the
baggage
train
going
in
search
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
his
own
wagon
the
most
sinister
rumors
about
the
armys
situation
had
reached
him
on
the
way
and
the
sight
of
the
feverishly
fleeing
army
confirmed
those
rumors

he
recalled
the
words
of
napoleons
order
to
his
army
before
the
start
of
the
campaign
and
these
words
aroused
in
him
at
once
an
astonishment
at
the
genius
of
the
hero
a
feeling
of
offended
pride
and
a
hope
of
glory
and
what
if
theres
nothing
left
but
to
die
he
thought
why
not
if
need
be
ill
do
it
no
worse
than
others
prince

looked
with
scorn
at
these
countless
mixedup
detachments
wagons
caissons
artillery
and
again
wagons
wagons
of
all
possible
sorts
trying
to
get
ahead
of
each

and
choking
the
muddy
road
three
or
four
abreast
on
all
sides
behind
and
before
as
far
as
hearing
could
reach
there
was
the
noise
of
wheels
the
rumbling
of
flatbeds
carts
and
gun
carriages
the
thud
of
hooves
the
crack
of
whips
the
shouts
of
drivers
the
cursing
of
soldiers
orderlies
and
officers
on
the
roadsides
one
constantly
saw
now

brokendown

near
which
solitary
soldiers
sat
waiting
for
something
now
soldiers
who
separated
from
their
detachments
and
went
in
groups
to
the
neighboring
villages
or
came
from
the
villages
dragging
chickens
sheep
hay
or
sacks
filled
with
something
on
the
ascents
and
descents
the
crowds
became
thicker
and
there
was
a
ceaseless
moan
of
cries
soldiers
sunk
in

up
to

down
among

trains
their
voices
were
faintly
heard
amidst
the
general
hubbub
and
one
could
see
from
their
faces
that
they
despaired
of
the
possibility
of
stopping
this

thought
bolkonsky
recalling
bilibins
words
wishing
to
ask
someone
among
these
people
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
he
rode
up
to
the
baggage
train
directly
in
front
of
him
rolled
a
strange
onehorse
vehicle
evidently
constructed
by
soldiers
using
homegrown
means
something
between
a
cart
a
cabriolet
and
a
carriage
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
was
a
soldier
and
in
it
under
a
leather
top
and
apron
sat
a
woman
all
wrapped
in
shawls
prince
andrei
rode
up
and
was
about
to
address
the
soldier
with
his
question
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
desperate
cries
of
the
woman
sitting
in
the
little
kibitka
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
baggage
train
was
beating
the
soldier
who
sat
on
the
box
of
this
little
carriage
for
trying
to
get
ahead
of
the
others
and
his
lash
struck
the
apron
of
the
vehicle
the
woman
cried
out
piercingly
seeing
prince
andrei
she
thrust
her
head
out
from
under
the
apron
and
waving
her
thin
arms
freed
from
the
ruglike
shawl
cried

repeated

the

obviously
liked
the
expression
he
told
that
little
adjutant
off
grandly
a
voice
came
from
behind
prince
andrei
could
see
that
the
officer
was
in
the
sort
of
drunken
fit
of
senseless
rage
when
people
do
not
know
what
they
are
saying
he
could
see
that
his
intercession
for
the
doctors
wife
in
the
kibitka
was
replete
with
what
he
feared
most
in
the
world
with
what
is
known
as
ridicule
but
his
instinct
told
him
otherwise
before
the
officer
had
time
to
finish
his
last
words
prince
andrei
his
face
disfigured
with
rage
rode
up
to
him
and
raised

the

waved
his

and
hastily
rode
off
its
all
from

these

officers
all
this
disorder
he
grumbled
do
it
your
way
prince
andrei
without
raising
his
eyes
hastily
rode
away
from
the
doctors
wife
who
was
calling
him
her
savior
and
recalling
with
disgust
the
minutest
details
of
this
humiliating
scene
rode
on
towards
the
village
where
he
had
been
told
the
commander
in
chief
was
on
entering
the
village
he
got
off
his
horse
and
went
to
the
first
house
intending
to
rest
for
at
least
a
moment
eat
something
and
bring
clarity
to
all
these
insulting
tormenting
thoughts
these
are
not
troops
theyre
a
mob
of
ruffians
he
was
thinking
as
he
went
to
the
window
of
the
first
house
when
a
familiar
voice
called
his
name
he
turned
around
nesvitskys
handsome
face
was
looking
out
of
a
small
window
nesvitsky
chewing
something
with
his
juicy
mouth
and
waving
his
arms
was
calling
to
him
bolkonsky
bolkonsky
are
you
deaf
or
what
come
quickly
he
shouted
going
into
the
house
prince
andrei
saw
nesvitsky
and
another
adjutant
having
something
to
eat
they
hastily
turned
to
bolkonsky
with
the
question
whether
he
had
any
fresh
news
on
their
familiar
faces
prince
andrei
read
the
expression
of
alarm
and
anxiety
this
expression
was
especially
noticeable
on
the
always
laughing
face
of
nesvitsky
wheres
the
commander
in
chief
asked
bolkonsky
here
in
that
house
the
adjutant
replied
well
so
is
it
true
theres
peace
and
capitulation
asked
nesvitsky
i
was
going
to
ask
you

hard
time

nesvitsky
and
i

excellent
packs

for
me
i
could
skip
off
over
the
bohemian
mountains
now
its
bad
brother
but

surely
unwell
the
way

shivering
asked
nesvitsky
noticing
how
prince
andrei
twitched
as
if
he
had
touched
a
leiden
jar
its
nothing
replied
prince
andrei
he
had
just
recalled
his
recent
encounter
with
the
doctors
wife
and
the
convoy
officer
what
is
the
commander
in
chief
doing
here
he
asked
i
understand
nothing
said
nesvitsky
i
understand
one
thing
that
its
all
vile
vile
vile
said
prince
andrei
and
he
went
to
the
house
where
the
commander
in
chief
was
staying
going
past
kutuzovs
carriage
the
winded
riding
horses
of
the
suite
and
the
cossacks
talking
loudly
among
themselves
prince
andrei
came
to
the
entryway
kutuzov
himself
as
prince
andrei
was
told
was
inside
the
cottage
with
prince
bagration
and
weyrother
weyrother
was
an
austrian
general
who
had
replaced
the
slain
schmidt
in
the
entryway
little
kozlovsky
was
crouching
in
front
of
a
scribe
the
scribe
the
cuffs
of
his
tunic
turned
up
was
writing
hurriedly
on
an
overturned
tub
kozlovskys
face
looked
exhaustedobviously
he
also
had
not
slept
that
night
he
glanced
at
prince
andrei
and
did
not
even
nod
to
him

you
written
that
he
went
on
dictating
to
the
scribe
the
kievsky
grenadiers
the
podolsky
dont
rush
your
honor
the
scribe
replied
disrespectfully
and
crossly
looking
up
at
kozlovsky
from
behind
the
door
just
then
came
the
animated
and
displeased
voice
of
kutuzov
interrupted
by
another
unknown
voice
from
the
sound
of
that
voice
from
the
inattention
with
which
kozlovsky
had
glanced
at
him
from
the
disrespectfulness
of
the
exhausted
scribe
from
the
fact
that
the
scribe
and
kozlovsky
were
sitting
so
close
to
the
commander
in
chief
on
the
floor
by
the
tub
and
from
the
fact
that
the
cossacks
who
tended
the
horses
were
laughing
loudly
outside
the
windowfrom
all
that
prince
andrei
could
feel
that
something
grave
and
unfortunate
must
be
happening
prince
andrei
plied
kozlovsky
with
insistent
questions
one
moment
prince
said
kozlovsky
a
disposition
for
bagration
and
capitulation
nothing
of
the
sort
orders
have
been
issued
for
battle
prince
andrei
went
to
the
door
behind
which
voices
could
be
heard
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
open
the
door
the
voices
in
the
room
fell
silent
the
door
opened
by
itself
and
kutuzov
with
his
eagles
beak
on
his
plump
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
prince
andrei
was
standing
directly
in
front
of
kutuzov
but
from
the
expression
in
the
commander
in
chiefs
one
good
eye
it
was
clear
that
his
thoughts
and
concerns
occupied
him
so
greatly
that
it
was
as
if
they
interfered
with
his
vision
he
looked
directly
at
his
adjutants
face
and
did
not
recognize
him
well
what
are
you
finished
he
addressed
kozlovsky
this
second
your
excellency
bagration
of
medium
height
with
a
firm
and
immobile
face
of
the
oriental
type
dry
not
yet
an
old
man
came
out
after
the
commander
in
chief
i
have
the
honor
of
reporting
to
you
prince
andrei
repeated
quite
loudly
handing
him
an
envelope
ah
from
vienna
very
well
later
later
kutuzov
and
bagration
stepped
out
to
the
porch
well
goodbye
prince
he
said
to
bagration
christ
be
with
you
i
bless
you
for
a
great
deed
kutuzovs
face
suddenly
softened
and
tears
welled
up
in
his
eyes
he
pulled
bagration
to
him
with
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
which
had
a
ring
on
it
making
an
obviously
habitual
gesture
crossed
him
and
offered
him
his
plump
cheek
instead
of
which
bagration
kissed
him
on
the
neck
christ
be
with
you
kutuzov
repeated
and
went
to
his
carriage
get
in
with
me
he
said
to
bolkonsky
your
excellency
i
should
like
to
be
of
use
here
allow
me
to
stay
in
prince
bagrations
detachment
get
in
said
kutuzov
and
noticing
that
bolkonsky
hung
back
said
i
need
good
officers
myself
they
got
into
the
carriage
and
rode
for
several
minutes
in
silence
there
is
still
much
before
us
much
of
everything
he
said
with
an
old
mans
perceptive
expression
as
though
he
understood
everything
that
was
going
on
in
bolkonskys
soul
if
one
tenth
of
his
detachment
comes
back
tomorrow
ill
thank
god
kutuzov
added
as
if
speaking
to
himself
prince
andrei
looked
at
kutuzov
and
his
eyes
were
involuntarily
struck
by
the
carefully
washed
creases
of
the
scar
on
kutuzovs
temple
a
foot
away
from
him
where
the
izmail
bullet
had
pierced
his
head
and
put
out
his
eye
yes
he
has
the
right
to
speak
so
calmly
about
the
deaths
of
these
people
thought
bolkonsky
that
is
why
i
am
asking
you
to
send
me
to
that
detachment
he
said
kutuzov
did
not
reply
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
he
had
said
and
sat
deep
in
thought
after
five
minutes
rocking
smoothly
on
the
soft
springs
of
the
carriage
kutuzov
turned
to
prince
andrei
there
was
no
trace
of
emotion
on
his
face
with
fine
irony
he
questioned
the
prince
about
the
details
of
his
meeting
with
the
emperor
about
the
opinions
he
had
heard
at
court
concerning
the
action
at
krems
and
about
several
women
of
their
mutual
acquaintance
xiv
on
the
first
of
november
kutuzov
received
information
through
one
of
his
scouts
that
placed
the
army
he
commanded
in
an
almost
hopeless
position
the
scout
had
reported
that
the
french
in
enormous
force
having
crossed
the
bridge
in
vienna
were
heading
towards
kutuzovs
line
of
communications
with
the
troops
coming
from
russia
if
kutuzov
decided
to
stay
in
krems
the
onehundredandfiftythousandman
army
of
napoleon
would
cut
him
off
from
all
communications
surround
his
exhausted
fortythousandman
army
and
he
would
find
himself
in
the
position
of
mack
at
ulm
if
kutuzov
decided
to
abandon
the
road
leading
to
communications
with
the
troops
from
russia
he
would
have
to
enter
with
no
road
into
the
unknown
territory
of
the
bohemian
mountains
defending
himself
from
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
and
abandoning
any
hope
of
communications
with
buxh246wden
if
kutuzov
decided
to
retreat
down
the
road
from
krems
to
olm252tz
to
unite
with
the
troops
from
russia
he
would
risk
being
forestalled
on
that
road
by
the
french
who
had
crossed
the
bridge
in
vienna
and
thus
being
forced
to
accept
battle
on
the
march
with
all
his
heavy
baggage
and
transport
and
to
deal
with
an
enemy
that
outnumbered
him
three
to
one
and
surrounded
him
on
both
sides
kutuzov
chose
this
last
course
the
french
as
the
scout
reported
had
crossed
the
bridge
in
vienna
and
by
forced
marches
were
making
for
znaim
which
lay
on
the
path
of
kutuzovs
retreat
more
than
sixty
miles
ahead
of
him
to
reach
znaim
before
the
french
meant
to
gain
great
hope
of
saving
the
army
to
let
the
french
forestall
them
in
znaim
meant
certainly
to
subject
the
whole
army
to
a
disgrace
similar
to
that
at
ulm
or
to
total
destruction
to
forestall
the
french
with
his
entire
army
was
impossible
the
road
from
vienna
to
znaim
was
shorter
and
better
than
the
russians
road
from
krems
to
znaim
the
night
he
received
this
information
kutuzov
sent
bagrations
fourthousandman
vanguard
to
the
right
over
the
hills
from
the
kremsznaim
to
the
viennaznaim
road
bagration
was
to
make
this
march
without
resting
to
stop
with
his
face
to
vienna
and
his
back
to
znaim
and
if
he
managed
to
forestall
the
french
to
detain
them
there
as
long
as
he
could
kutuzov
himself
started
out
for
znaim
with
all
the
heavy
baggage
having
gone
thirty
miles
across
the
hills
with
hungry
illshod
soldiers
with
no
road
on
a
stormy
night
losing
a
third
of
his
men
as
stragglers
bagration
came
out
in
hollabrunn
on
the
viennaznaim
road
several
hours
ahead
of
the
french
who
were
approaching
hollabrunn
from
vienna
kutuzov
still
needed
to
go
a
whole
twentyfour
hours
with
his
baggage
train
to
reach
znaim
and
therefore
to
save
the
army
bagration
with
four
thousand
hungry
exhausted
soldiers
had
to
hold
off
for
twentyfour
hours
the
entire
enemy
army
coming
to
meet
him
at
hollabrunn
which
was
obviously
impossible
but
a
freak
of
fate
made
the
impossible
possible
the
success
of
the
trick
which
gave
the
vienna
bridge
into
the
hands
of
the
french
without
a
fight
prompted
murat
to
try
to
trick
kutuzov
in
the
same
way
murat
meeting
bagrations
weak
detachment
on
the
znaim
road
thought
it
was
the
whole
of
kutuzovs
army
in
order
to
crush
this
army
indubitably
he
awaited
the
troops
that
lagged
behind
on
the
road
from
vienna
and
with
that
aim
suggested
a
threeday
truce
on
condition
that
neither
army
change
its
position
or
stir
from
its
place
murat
assured
them
that
peace
negotiations
were
already
under
way
and
that
therefore
to
avoid
useless
bloodshed
he
was
suggesting
a
truce
the
austrian
general
count
nostitz
who
occupied
the
advance
posts
believed
the
words
of
murats
envoy
and
fell
back
exposing
bagrations
detachment
another
envoy
rode
to
the
russian
line
to
announce
the
same
news
of
peace
negotiations
and
offer
the
russian
army
a
threeday
truce
bagration
replied
that
he
could
neither
accept
nor
reject
a
truce
and
sent
his
adjutant
to
kutuzov
with
a
report
of
the
offer
made
to
him
for
kutuzov
the
truce
was
the
sole
means
of
gaining
time
giving
bagrations
exhausted
detachment
some
rest
and
allowing
the
train
and
heavy
baggage
whose
movement
was
concealed
from
the
french
to
make
at
least
one
extra
march
towards
znaim
the
offer
of
a
truce
gave
the
sole
and
unexpected
possibility
of
saving
the
army
on
receiving
this
news
kutuzov
immediately
sent
the
adjutant
general
wintzingerode
who
was
attached
to
him
to
the
enemy
camp
wintzingerode
was
not
only
to
accept
the
truce
but
also
to
offer
conditions
for
capitulation
and
meanwhile
kutuzov
sent
his
adjutants
back
to
speed
up
as
much
as
possible
the
movement
of
the
whole
armys
baggage
trains
along
the
kremsznaim
road
bagrations
exhausted
hungry
detachment
covering
this
movement
of
the
baggage
trains
and
the
whole
army
had
alone
to
remain
unmoving
before
an
enemy
eight
times
its
strength
kutuzovs
expectations
came
true
both
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
offer
of
capitulation
without
committing
them
to
anything
might
gain
time
for
some
portion
of
the
baggage
train
to
pass
and
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
murats
mistake
was
bound
to
be
discovered
very
quickly
as
soon
as
bonaparte
who
was
in
sch246nbrunn
some
fifteen
miles
from
hollabrunn
received
murats
communication
with
the
project
of
a
truce
and
capitulation
he
saw
through
the
deception
and
wrote
the
following

galloped
off
at
full
speed
with
this
threatening
letter
to
murat
bonaparte
himself
not
trusting
his
generals
moved
with
all
his
guards
to
the
field
of

fearing
to
let
the
ready
victim
slip
while

cheerfully
lit

dried

cooked
kasha
for
the
first
time
in
three
days
and
not
one
man
in
the
division
knew
or
thought
about
what
lay
ahead
of
him
xv
it
was
past
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
when
prince
andrei
who
had
persuaded
kutuzov
to
grant
his
request
arrived
in
grunt
and
went
to
bagration
bonapartes
adjutant
had
not
yet
reached
murats
division
and
the
battle
had
not
yet
begun
in
bagrations
division
nothing
was
known
about
the
general
course
of
affairs
they
talked
of
peace
but
did
not
believe
in
its
possibility
they
talked
of
battle
and
also
did
not
believe
in
the
nearness
of

bagration
knowing
bolkonsky
to
be
a
favorite
and
trusted
adjutant
received
him
with
a
superior
officers
special
distinction
and
indulgence
explained
to
him
that
there
would
probably
be
a
battle
that
day
or
the
next
and
allowed
him
full
freedom
to
stay
by
him
during
the
battle
or
to
supervise
the
order
of
retreat
in
the
rear
guard
which
was
also
very
important
however
there
will
probably
be
no
action
today
said
bagration
as
if
to
soothe
prince
andrei
if
hes
one
of
those
ordinary
staff
dandies
sent
to
earn
himself
a
little
cross
he
can
earn
it
just
as
well
in
the
rear
guard
but
if
he
wants
to
be
with
me
let
himhell
be
useful
if
hes
a
brave
officer
thought
bagration
prince
andrei
having
said
nothing
asked
permission
to
go
around
the
lines
and
learn
the
disposition
of
the
forces
so
as
to
know
where
to
go
in
case
of
an
errand
the
officer
on
duty
in
the
detachment
a
handsome
man
foppishly
dressed
and
with
a
diamond
ring
on
his
index
finger
who
spoke
french
poorly
but
eagerly
volunteered
to
accompany
prince
andrei
on
all
sides
one
saw
wet
sadfaced
officers
who
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
and
soldiers
who
were
dragging
doors
benches
and
fences
from
the
village
you
see
prince
we
cant
rid
ourselves
of
these
folk
said
the
staff
officer
pointing
to
them
the
commanders
neglect
discipline
and
here
he
pointed
to
a
sutlers
tent
they
crowd
in
and
sit
this
morning
i
drove
them
all
out
look
its
full
again
we
must
ride
over
prince
and
scare
them
away
for
a
moment
lets
go
in
ill
have
some
bread
and
cheese
said
prince
andrei
who
had
not
yet
had
time
to
eat
why
didnt
you
tell
me
prince
id
have
offered
you
my
hospitality
they
dismounted
and
went
into
the
sutlers
tent
several
officers
with
flushed
and
languorous
faces
were
sitting
at
tables
eating
and
drinking
well
what
is
this
gentlemen
the
staff
officer
said
in
a
tone
of
reproach
like
a
man
who
has
already
repeated
the
same
thing
several
times
you
cant
absent
yourselves
like
this
the
prince
ordered
that
nobody
should
be
found
here
well
take
you
mister
staff
captain
he
addressed
a
small
dirty
thin
artillery
officer
who
was
standing
bootless
before
the
entering
men
he
had
given
his
boots
to
the
sutler
to
dry
just
in
his
stockings
smiling
not
quite
naturally
well
captain
tushin
arent
you
ashamed
the
staff
officer
went
on
it
would
seem
that
you
as
an
artillerist
ought
to
set
an
example
and
here
you
are
bootless
theyll
sound
the
alarm
and
a
fine
one
youll
be
with
no
boots
on
the
staff
officer
smiled
kindly
go
back
to
your
posts
gentlemenall
all
of
you
he
added
in
a
superiors
tone
prince
andrei
smiled
involuntarily
looking
at
captain
tushin
silent
and
smiling
tushin
shifted
from
one
bare
foot
to
the
other
and
looked
questioningly
with
his
large
intelligent
and
kindly
eyes
first
at
prince
andrei
then
at
the
staff
officer
soldiers
say
its
nimbler
barefoot
said
captain
tushin
with
a
timorous
smile
evidently
wishing
to
turn
his
awkward
position
into
a
joke
but
before
he
finished
he
felt
that
his
joke
was
unsuccessful
and
had
not
gone
over
he
became
embarrassed
kindly
go
said
the
staff
officer
trying
to
maintain
his
seriousness
prince
andrei
looked
once
more
at
the
little
figure
of
the
artillerist
there
was
something
special
in
it
totally
unmilitary
slightly
comical
but
extremely
attractive
the
staff
officer
and
prince
andrei
got
on
their
horses
and
rode
further
having
left
the
village
constantly
meeting
and
going
ahead
of
walking
soldiers
officers
of
various
detachments
they
saw
to
their
left
the
reddish
fresh
newly
dug
clay
of
the
fortification
under
construction
several
battalions
of
soldiers
in
nothing
but
their
shirts
despite
the
cold
wind
were
swarming
like
white
ants
over
this
fortification
someone
invisible
kept
shoveling
out
red
clay
from
behind
the
rampart
they
rode
up
to
the
fortification
examined
it
and
rode
on
just
behind
the
fortification
they
ran
into
several
dozen
soldiers
constantly
replacing
each
other
running
down
the
rampart
they
had
to
hold
their
noses
and
set
their
horses
at
a
trot
to
get
away
from
that
poisoned
atmosphere

said
the

officer
on
duty
they
rode
to
the
opposite
hill
from
this
hill
they
could
already
see
the
french
prince
andrei
stopped
and
began
to
examine
heres
where
our
battery
stands
said
the
staff
officer
indicating
the
highest
point
the
one
of
that
odd
bird
who
was
sitting
there
without
boots
you
can
see
everything
from
there
lets
go
prince
i
humbly
thank
you
ill
go
by
myself
now
said
prince
andrei
wishing
to
rid
himself
of
the
staff
officer
dont
trouble
yourself
please
the
staff
officer
stayed
behind
and
prince
andrei
rode
on
alone
the
further
ahead
he
moved
the
closer
to
the
enemy
the
more
orderly
and
cheerful
the
troops
looked
the
greatest
disorder
and
despondency
had
been
in
that
baggage
train
before
znaim
which
prince
andrei
had
circled
around
in
the
morning
and
which
was
some
seven
miles
away
from
the
french
in
grunt
there
was
also
a
feeling
of
a
certain
alarm
and
fear
of
something
but
the
closer
prince
andrei
rode
to
the
french
line
the
more
selfassured
our
troops
looked
lined
up
in
ranks
the
soldiers
stood
in
their
greatcoats
and
a
sergeant
major
and
a
company
commander
counted
heads
jabbing
a
finger
towards
the
last
soldier
in
the
row
and
ordering
him
to
raise
his
hand
scattered
all
over
the
area
soldiers
were
carrying
firewood
and
brushwood
and
building
little
leantos
laughing
merrily
and
talking
among
themselves
some
sat
by
the
campfires
dressed
or
naked
drying
their
shirts
and
foot
cloths
or
mending
boots
and
greatcoats
crowding
around
the
cauldrons
and
cooks
in
one
company
dinner
was
ready
and
the
soldiers
looked
greedily
at
the
steaming
cauldrons
waiting
until
an
officer
who
was
sitting
on
a
log
facing
his
leanto
had
tried
the
kasha
brought
to
him
in
a
wooden
bowl
by
a
quartermaster
sergeant
in
another
more
fortunate
company
since
not
all
of
them
had
vodka
soldiers
crowded
around
a
pockmarked
broadshouldered
sergeant
major
who
tipping
a
keg
poured
into
the
canteen
caps
that
the
soldiers
held
out
in
turn
the
soldiers
with
pious
faces
brought
the
caps
to
their
mouths
upended
them
and
rinsing
their
mouths
and
wiping
them
on
their
greatcoat
sleeves
walked
away
from
the
sergeant
major
with
cheered
faces
all
the
faces
were
as
calm
as
though
everything
was
happening
not
in
view
of
the
enemy
prior
to
an
action
in
which
at
least
half
the
division
would
be
left
on
the
field
but
somewhere
in
their
home
country
in
expectation
of
a
peaceful
stay
having
passed
the
regiment
of
chasseurs
and
through
the
lines
of
the
kievsky
grenadiersbrave
folk
occupied
with
the
same
peaceful
affairsprince
andrei
drew
near
the
tall
leanto
unlike
the
others
of
the
regimental
commander
and
came
out
to
a
linedup
platoon
of
grenadiers
before
whom
lay
a
stripped
man
two
soldiers
were
holding
him
and
two
swinging
supple
switches
were
beating
him
rhythmically
on
his
stripped
back
the
punished
man
was
crying
out
unnaturally
a
fat
major
walked
in
front
of
the
line
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
cries
ceaselessly
repeated
it
is
a
disgrace
for
a
soldier
to
steal
a
soldier
should
be
honest
noble
and
brave
and
if
one
steals
from
his
comrade
there
is
no
honor
in
him
he
is
a
scoundrel
more
more
again
there
came
the
supple
strokes
and
a
desperate
but
feigned
cry
more
more
repeated
the
major
a
young
officer
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
and
suffering
on
his
face
walked
away
from
the
punished
man
looking
questioningly
at
the
passing
adjutant
prince
andrei
having
reached
the
front
line
rode
along
it
our
line
and
the
enemys
stood
far
from
each
other
on
the
left
and
right
flanks
but
in
the
center
where
the
envoys
had
passed
that
morning
the
lines
came
so
close
that
the
men
could
see
each
others
faces
and
talk
to
each
other
besides
the
soldiers
who
occupied
the
line
at
that
place
many
of
the
curious
stood
on
both
sides
and
gazed
laughing
at
their
strange
and
foreignlooking
enemies
since
early
morning
though
it
was
forbidden
to
go
near
the
line
the
officers
had
been
unable
to
ward
off
the
curious
the
soldiers
stationed
on
the
line
like
people
displaying
something
rare
no
longer
looked
at
the
french
but
made
their
observations
to
those
who
came
and
languishing
waited
to
be
relieved
prince
andrei
stopped
to
examine
the
french
look
look
one
soldier
said
to
his
comrade
pointing
to
a
russian
musketeer
who
had
gone
up
to
the
line
along
with
an
officer
and
was
speaking
rapidly
and
heatedly
with
a
french
grenadier
see
how
clever
he
patters
away
even
the
khrenchman
cant
keep
up
with
him
now
you
sidorov
wait
listen
thats
really
clever
replied
sidorov
who
was
considered
an
expert
at
speaking
french
the
soldier
at
whom
the
laughing
men
were
pointing
was
dolokhov
prince
andrei
recognized
him
and
listened
to
what
he
was
saying
dolokhov
and
his
company
commander
had
come
to
the
line
from
the
left
flank
where
their
regiment
was
stationed
go
on
more
more
the
company
commander
egged
him
on
leaning
forward
and
trying
not
to
miss
a
single
incomprehensible
word
thicker
and
faster
whats
he
saying
dolokhov
did
not
answer
his
company
commander
he
was
involved
in
a
heated
argument
with
the
french
grenadier
they
were
talking
as
they
could
only
have
been
about
the
campaign
the
frenchman
confusing
the
austrians
with
the
russians
insisted
that
the
russians
had
surrendered
and
fled
all
the
way
from
ulm
dolokhov
insisted
that
the
russians
had
not
surrendered
but
had
beaten
the
french
we
have
orders
to
drive
you
away
and
thats
what
were
going
to
do
said
dolokhov
only
try
hard
not
to
get
captured
with
all
your
cossacks
said
the
french
grenadier
the
french
onlookers
and

came
from
among
the
soldiers
that
it
crossed
the
line
and
involuntarily
infected
the
french
after
which
it
seemed
they
ought
quickly
to
unload
their
guns
blow
up
their
munitions
and
all
quickly
go
back
home
but
the
guns
remained
loaded
the
loopholes
in
the
houses
and
fortifications
looked
out
just
as
menacingly
and
the
unlimbered
cannon
remained
turned
against
each
other
just
as
before
xvi
having
ridden
all
along
the
line
of
troops
from
the
right
flank
to
the
left
prince
andrei
went
up
to
the
battery
from
which
according
to
the
staff
officers
words
one
could
see
the
whole
field
here
he
got
off
his
horse
and
stopped
by
the
last
of
the
four
unlimbered
cannon
in
front
of
the
cannon
paced
an
artillery
sentry
who
snapped
to
attention
before
the
officer
but
at
a
sign
from
him
renewed
his
measured
tedious
pacing
behind
the
cannon
stood
their
limbers
further
behind
a
hitching
rail
and
the
campfires
of
the
artillerists
to
the
left
not
far
from
the
last
cannon
there
was
a
newly
plaited
leanto
from
which
came
the
animated
voices
of
the
officers
indeed
from
the
battery
a
view
opened
out
of
almost
the
entire
disposition
of
the
russian
troops
and
the
greater
the
enemys
directly
facing
the
battery
on
the
crest
of
the
knoll
opposite
one
could
see
the
village
of
sch246ngraben
to
left
and
right
it
was
possible
to
make
out
in
three
places
amidst
the
smoke
of
their
campfires
the
masses
of
the
french
troops
of
whom
the
greater
evidently
in
the
village
itself
and
behind
the
hill
to
the
left
of
the
village
in
the
smoke
appeared
something
resembling
a
battery
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
it
well
with
the
naked
eye
our
right
flank
was
disposed
on
a
rather
steep
elevation
which
dominated
the
positions
of
the
french
on
it
our
infantry
was
disposed
and
at
the
very
end
one
could
see
the
dragoons
in
the
center
where
tushins
battery
stood
from
where
prince
andrei
was
surveying
the
position
there
was
a
gently
sloping
and
direct
descent
and
ascent
to
the
stream
that
separated
us
from
sch246ngraben
to
the
left
our
troops
adjoined
a
woods
where
smoked
the
campfires
of
our
infantry
who
were
cutting
firewood
the
french
line
was
wider
than
ours
and
it
was
obvious
that
the
french
could
easily
encircle
us
from
both
sides
behind
our
position
was
a
steep
and
deep
ravine
through
which
it
would
be
hard
for
artillery
and
cavalry
to
retreat
prince
andrei
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
cannon
and
taking
out
his
notebook
drew
a
plan
of
the
disposition
of
the
troops
for
himself
in
two
places
he
penciled
some
notes
intending
to
tell
bagration
about
them
he
proposed
first
to
concentrate
all
the
artillery
in
the
center
second
to
transfer
the
cavalry
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
prince
andrei
had
been
constantly
at
the
commander
in
chiefs
side
had
followed
the
movements
of
masses
and
the
general
orders
and
had
constantly
been
taken
up
with
historical
descriptions
of
battles
and
in
this
forthcoming
action
involuntarily
considered
the
future
course
of
the
military
operations
only
in
general
terms
he
pictured
only
major
occurrences
of
the
following
kind
if
the
enemy
mounts
an
attack
on
the
right
flank
he
said
to
himself
the
kievsky
grenadiers
and
the
podolsky
chasseurs
will
have
to
hold
their
positions
until
reserves
from
the
center
reach
them
in
that
case
the
dragoons
can
strike
at
the
flank
and
overthrow
them
in
case
of
an
attack
on
the
center
we
can
deploy
the
central
battery
on
this
elevation
and
under
its
cover
pull
back
the
left
flank
and
retreat
into
the
ravine
by
echelons
he
reasoned
to
himself
all
the
while
he
was
in
the
battery
by
the
cannon
as
often
happens
he
had
never
stopped
hearing
the
sounds
of
the
officers
voices
talking
in
the
leanto
but
had
not
understood
a
single
word
of
what
they
were
saying
suddenly
the
sound
of
voices
from
the
leanto
struck
him
with
such
soulfelt
tones
that
he
involuntarily
began
to
listen
no
dear
heart
spoke
a
pleasant
voice
which
seemed
familiar
to
prince
andrei
i
say
that
if
it
were
possible
to
know
what
there
will
be
after
death
none
of
us
would
be
afraid
of
death
thats
so
dear
heart
another
younger
voice
interrupted
him
afraid
or
not
all
the
same
you
cant
avoid
it
but
youre
still
afraid
eh
you
learned
people
said
a
third
manly
voice
interrupting
the
two
others
thats
why
you
artillerists
are
so
learned
because
you
can
tote
everything
along
with
you
both
vodka
and
grub
and
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
probably
an
infantry
officer
laughed
but
youre
still
afraid
the
first
familiar
voice
went
on
afraid
of
the
unknown
thats
what
however
much
we
say
that
the
soul
will
go
to
heavenwe
know
that
there
is
no
heaven
but
only
atmosphere
again
the
manly
voice
interrupted
the
artillerist
well
lets
have
some
of
your
herb
liqueur
tushin
it
said
ah
its
that
same
captain
who
stood
without
boots
in
the
canteen
thought
prince
andrei
glad
to
have
identified
the
pleasant
philosophizing
voice
herb
liqueurs
possible
said
tushin
but
even
so
to
understand
the
future
life
he
did
not
finish
just
then
a
whistling
was
heard
in
the
air
closer
closer
faster
and
louder
louder
and
faster
and
a
cannonball
as
if
not
finishing
all
it
had
to
say
crashed
to
the
ground
with
inhuman
force
not
far
from
the
leanto
throwing
up
a
spray
of
dirt
the
earth
seemed
to
gasp
from
the
terrible
blow
at
that
same
moment
little
tushin
came
running
out
of
the
leanto
ahead
of
everyone
else
his
pipe
askew
in
his
teeth
his
kindly
intelligent
face
was
slightly
pale
after
him
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
came
out
a
dashing
infantry
officer
and
ran
to
his
company
buttoning
himself
up
as
he
ran
xvii
prince
andrei
mounted
up
stayed
at
the
battery
looking
at
the
smoke
of
the
cannon
from
which
the
cannonball
had
come
flying
his
eyes
ran
over
the
vast
space
he
saw
only
that
the
previously
immobile
masses
of
the
french
began
to
sway
and
that
there
was
indeed
a
battery
to
the
left
the
smoke
there
had
not
yet
dispersed
two
french
horsemen
probably
adjutants
were
galloping
over
the
hill
a
small
column
of
the
enemy
clearly
visible
was
moving
down
the
hillside
probably
to
reinforce
the
line
the
smoke
of
the
first
shot
had
not
scattered
when
another
puff
appeared
followed
by
a
report
the
battle
had
begun
prince
andrei
turned
his
horse
and
rode
back
to
grunt
to
look
for
prince
bagration
behind
him
he
heard
the
cannonade
growing
louder
and
heavier
evidently
ours
had
begun
to
respond
below
in
the
place
where
the
envoys
had
passed
musketfire
was
heard
lemarrois
had
just
come
galloping
to
murat
with
the
menacing
letter
from
bonaparte
and
the
shamed
murat
wishing
to
smooth
over
his
mistake
at
once
moved
his
troops
up
to
the
center
and
around
both
flanks
hoping
before
evening
and
the
emperors
arrival
to
crush
the
insignificant
detachment
that
stood
facing
him
its
begun
here
it
is
thought
prince
andrei
feeling
the
blood
beginning
to
rush
more
quickly
to
his
heart
but
where
then
how
will
my
toulon
declare
itself
he
thought
riding
among
the
same
companies
that
had
been
eating
kasha
and
drinking
vodka
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
he
saw
everywhere
the
same
quick
movements
of
soldiers
lining
up
and
taking
their
muskets
and
on
all
faces
he
recognized
the
feeling
of
animation
that
was
in
his
heart
its
begun
here
it
is
fearful
and
merry
spoke
the
face
of
every
soldier
and
officer
before
he
reached
the
stillunfinished
fortification
he
saw
horsemen
moving
towards
him
in
the
evening
light
of
the
gray
autumnal
day
the
foremost
in
a
felt
cloak
and
peaked
astrakhan
cap
was
riding
a
white
horse
it
was
prince
bagration
prince
andrei
stopped
to
wait
for
him
prince
bagration
reined
in
his
horse
and
recognizing
prince
andrei
nodded
to
him
he
went
on
looking
ahead
all
the
while
prince
andrei
was
telling
him
what
he
had
seen
the
expression
its
begun
here
it
is
was
even
on
the
firm
swarthy
face
of
prince
bagration
with
its
halfclosed
eyes
lackluster
as
if
from
want
of
sleep
prince
andrei
peered
into
that
immobile
face
with
anxious
curiosity
and
wished
to
know
whether
this
man
thought
and
felt
and
what
he
thought
and
felt
at
that
moment
is
there
anything
there
behind
that
immobile
face
prince
andrei
asked
himself
looking
at
him
prince
bagration
inclined
his
head
as
a
sign
of
assent
to
prince
andreis
words
and
said
very
good
with
such
an
expression
as
if
everything
that
was
taking
place
and
that
had
been
reported
to
him
was
precisely
what
he
had
already
foreseen
prince
andrei
breathless
from
fast
riding
spoke
quickly
prince
bagration
pronounced
words
especially
slowly
with
his
oriental
accent
as
if
to
suggest
that
they
were
not
hurrying
anywhere
nevertheless
he
started
his
horse
at
a
trot
towards
tushins
battery
prince
andrei
and
the
suite
followed
behind
him
behind
prince
bagration
rode
an
officer
of
the
suite
the
princes
personal
adjutant
zherkov
an
orderly
officer
the
staff
officer
on
duty
on
a
handsome
bobtailed
horse
and
a
state
councillor
an
auditor
who
had
asked
to
come
to
the
battle
out
of
curiosity
the
auditor
a
plump
man
with
a
plump
face
and
a
na239ve
smile
of
joy
looked
around
him
jolting
along
on
his
horse
and
made
a
strange
sight
in
his
camlet
coat
on
a
goverment
issue
saddle
among
the
hussars
cossacks
and
adjutants
see
he
wants
to
have
a
look
at
a
battle
zherkov
said
to
bolkonsky
pointing
to
the
auditor
but
hes
got
a
knot
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
well
enough
from
you
the
auditor
said
with
a
beaming
smile
na239ve
and
at
the
same
time
sly
as
if
he
was
flattered
to
be
the
butt
of
zherkovs
jokes
and
as
if
he
was
deliberately
trying
to
seem
stupider
than
he
really
was
tr232s
dr244le
mon
monsieur
prince
said
the
staff
officer
on
duty
he
remembered
that
there
was
some
special
way
of
addressing
a
prince
in
french
but
was
unable
to
get
it
right
just
then
they
were
all
approaching
tushins
battery
and
a
cannonball
landed
in
front
of
them
what
fell
the
auditor
asked
smiling
na239vely
french
pancakes
said
zherkov
so
thats
what
they
hit
you
with
asked
the
auditor
how
frightful
and
he
seemed
to
melt
all
over
with
satisfaction
he
had
barely
finished
speaking
when
there
again
came
an
unexpected
dreadful
whistle
suddenly
ending
in
a
thud
against
something
liquid
and
ffflopa
cossack
riding
a
little
to
the
right
and
behind
the
auditor
crashed
to
the
ground
with
his
horse
zherkov
and
the
staff
officer
on
duty
crouched
low
to
their
saddles
and
turned
their
horses
away
the
auditor
stopped
in
front
of
the
cossack
examining
him
with
attentive
curiosity
the
cossack
was
dead
the
horse
was
still
thrashing
prince
bagration
narrowing
his
eyes
turned
to
look
and
seeing
the
cause
of
the
confusion
looked
away
indifferently
as
if
saying
is
it
worth
bothering
with
such
stupidities
he
stopped
his
horse
the
way
a
good
rider
does
bent
over
a
little
and
straightened
his
sword
which
had
caught
in
his
felt
cloak
the
sword
was
an
old
one
not
the
kind
men
wore
now
prince
andrei
recalled
the
story
of
how
suvorov
had
made
a
gift
of
his
sword
to
bagration
in
italy
and
this
recollection
was
especially
pleasing
to
him
at
that
moment
they
rode
up
to
the
battery
near
which
bolkonsky
had
stood
when
he
examined
the
battlefield
whose
company
prince
bagration
asked
a
fireworker
standing
by
the
caissons
he
asked
whose
company
but
essentially
he
was
asking
youre
not
scared
here
are
you
and
the
fireworker
understood
that
captain
tushins
your
excellency
the
redhaired
frecklefaced
fireworker
cried
out
in
a
merry
voice
snapping
to
attention
so
so
said
bagration
calculating
something
and
he
rode
past
the
limbers
to
the
end
cannon
while
he
was
on
his
way
there
a
shot
rang
out
from
that
cannon
deafening
him
and
his
suite
and
in
the
smoke
that
suddenly
surrounded
the
cannon
one
could
see
the
artillerists
seize
hold
of
it
and
straining
hurriedly
pull
it
back
to
its
former
place
the
broadshouldered
enormous
soldier
number
one
with
a
swab
in
his
hand
his
legs
spread
wide
jumped
over
to
the
wheel
number
two
was
loading
a
charge
into
the
muzzle
with
a
trembling
hand
a
small
stooping
man
the
officer
tushin
stumbling
over
the
trail
ran
forward
not
noticing
the
general
and
peering
from
under
his
small
hand
add
two
more
notches
and
itll
be
just
right
he
shouted
in
a
highpitched
voice
trying
to
give
it
a
dashing
sound
which
did
not
go
with
his
little
figure
number
two
he
squeaked
smash
em
medvedev
bagration
called
to
the
officer
and
tushin
went
over
to
the
general
putting
three
fingers
to
his
visor
in
a
timid
and
awkward
movement
not
as
military
men
salute
but
as
priests
bless
though
tushins
guns
were
meant
to
be
shooting
into
the
hollow
he
was
sending
fireballs
at
the
village
of
sch246ngraben
visible
straight
ahead
before
which
large
masses
of
french
were
moving
forward
no
one
had
given
tushin
any
orders
about
where
to
shoot
or
with
what
and
having
consulted
his
sergeant
major
zakharchenko
for
whom
he
had
great
respect
he
had
decided
that
it
would
be
good
to
set
fire
to
the
village
very
good
bagration
said
to
the
officers
report
and
he
began
to
survey
the
whole
battlefield
opened
out
before
him
as
if
calculating
something
on
the
right
side
the
french
had
come
nearest
of
all
below
the
elevation
on
which
the
kievsky
regiment
stood
in
the
river
hollow
the
soulwrenching
roll
and
crackle
of
musketfire
could
be
heard
and
much
further
to
the
right
beyond
the
dragoons
the
officer
of
the
suite
pointed
out
to
the
prince
a
column
of
the
french
turning
our
flank
to
the
left
the
horizon
was
limited
by
the
neighboring
woods
prince
bagration
ordered
two
battalions
from
the
center
to
go
as
reinforcements
to
the
right
the
officer
of
the
suite
ventured
to
observe
to
the
prince
that
with
those
two
battalions
gone
the
cannon
would
remain
exposed
prince
bagration
turned
to
the
officer
of
the
suite
and
looked
at
him
silently
with
his
lackluster
eyes
it
seemed
to
prince
andrei
that
the
officer
of
the
suites
observation
was
correct
and
there
was
indeed
nothing
to
say
but
just
then
an
adjutant
came
galloping
from
the
regimental
commander
who
was
in
the
hollow
with
a
report
that
huge
masses
of
the
french
were
coming
from
below
that
the
regiment
was
in
disarray
and
was
falling
back
towards
the
kievsky
grenadiers
prince
bagration
inclined
his
head
as
a
sign
of
assent
and
approval
he
rode
to
the
right
at
a
walk
and
sent
an
adjutant
to
the
dragoons
with
an
order
to
attack
the
french
but
the
adjutant
sent
there
came
back
half
an
hour
later
with
the
report
that
the
regimental
commander
of
the
dragoons
had
already
pulled
back
beyond
the
ravine
because
heavy
fire
had
been
directed
at
him
and
he
had
been
losing
men
uselessly
and
therefore
he
had
dismounted
his
riflemen
in
the
woods
very
good
said
bagration
as
he
was
riding
away
from
the
battery
shots
were
also
heard
to
the
left
in
the
woods
and
as
it
was
too
far
from
the
left
flank
for
him
to
get
there
in
time
himself
prince
bagration
sent
zherkov
there
to
tell
the
senior
general
the
one
who
had
presented
the
regiment
to
kutuzov
in
braunau
to
pull
back
beyond
the
ravine
as
quickly
as
possible
because
the
right
flank
would
probably
be
unable
to
hold
the
enemy
for
long
tushin
and
the
battalion
covering
him
were
forgotten
prince
andrei
listened
carefully
to
prince
bagrations
exchanges
with
the
commanders
and
to
the
orders
he
gave
and
noticed
to
his
surprise
that
no
orders
were
given
and
that
prince
bagration
only
tried
to
pretend
that
all
that
was
done
by
necessity
chance
or
the
will
of
a
particular
commander
that
it
was
all
done
if
not
on
his
orders
then
in
accord
with
his
intentions
owing
to
the
tact
shown
by
prince
bagration
prince
andrei
noticed
that
in
spite
of
the
chance
character
of
events
and
their
independence
of
the
commanders
will
his
presence
accomplished
a
very
great
deal
commanders
who
rode
up
to
prince
bagration
with
troubled
faces
became
calm
soldiers
and
officers
greeted
him
merrily
and
became
more
animated
in
his
presence
and
obviously
showed
off
their
courage
before
him
xviii
prince
bagration
having
ridden
to
the
highest
point
on
our
right
flank
started
down
to
where
rolling
gunfire
could
be
heard
and
nothing
could
be
seen
through
the
powder
smoke
the
further
they
descended
into
the
hollow
the
less
they
could
see
but
the
more
they
could
sense
the
nearness
of
the
actual
battlefield
they
began
to
meet
the
wounded
one
with
a
bloodied
head
hatless
was
being
dragged
under
the
arms
by
two
soldiers
he
gurgled
and
spat
the
bullet
seemed
to
have
hit
him
in
the
mouth
or
the
throat
another
came
towards
them
walking
briskly
by
himself
without
his
musket
groaning
loudly
and
waving
his
arm
from
the
fresh
pain
while
blood
poured
over
his
greatcoat
as
if
from
a
flask
his
face
showed
more
fear
than
suffering
he
had
been
wounded
a
moment
before
crossing
the
road
they
began
a
steep
descent
and
on
the
slope
saw
several
men
who
were
lying
down
they
met
a
crowd
of
soldiers
some
of
whom
were
not
wounded
the
soldiers
were
walking
up
the
hill
breathing
heavily
and
though
they
saw
the
general
were
talking
loudly
and
waving
their
arms
ahead
in
the
smoke
lines
of
gray
greatcoats
could
now
be
seen
and
an
officer
catching
sight
of
bagration
ran
shouting
after
the
soldiers
walking
in
a
crowd
demanding
that
they
turn
back
bagration
rode
up
to
the
lines
along
which
there
was
here
and
there
a
rapid
crackle
of
gunfire
drowning
out
talk
and
shouts
of
command
the
air
was
completely
saturated
with
powder
smoke
the
soldiers
faces
were
all
smudged
with
powder
and
animated
some
tamped
down
with
ramrods
others
primed
the
pans
and
took
shot
from
their
pouches
still
others
fired
but
who
they
were
firing
at
could
not
be
seen
owing
to
the
smoke
which
there
was
no
wind
to
scatter
pleasant
buzzing
and
whistling
noises
were
heard
rather
often
whats
that
thought
prince
andrei
riding
up
to
the
crowd
of
soldiers
it
cant
be
a
line
because
theyre
in
a
bunch
it
cant
be
an
attack
because
theyre
not
moving
it
cant
be
a
square
theyre
not
standing
right
a
lean
weaklooking
old
man
a
regimental
commander
with
a
pleasant
smile
with
eyelids
that
more
than
half
covered
his
old
mans
eyes
giving
him
a
meek
look
rode
up
to
prince
bagration
and
received
him
as
a
host
receives
a
welcome
guest
he
reported
to
prince
bagration
that
the
french
had
mounted
a
cavalry
attack
against
his
regiment
and
that
while
the
attack
had
been
beaten
off
the
regiment
had
lost
more
than
half
its
men
the
regimental
commander
said
that
the
attack
had
been
beaten
off
coming
up
with
this
military
term
to
describe
what
had
happened
in
his
regiment
but
in
reality
he
did
not
know
himself
what
had
happened
in
that
half
hour
among
the
troops
entrusted
to
him
and
he
could
not
say
for
certain
whether
the
attack
had
been
beaten
off
or
his
regiment
had
been
crushed
by
the
attack
at
the
start
of
the
action
he
knew
only
that
cannonballs
and
shells
began
flying
all
over
his
regiment
and
hitting
people
that
someone
then
shouted
cavalry
and
our
men
began
to
fire
and
they
were
still
firing
no
longer
at
the
cavalry
who
had
disappeared
but
at
the
french
infantry
who
had
appeared
in
the
hollow
and
were
shooting
at
our
men
prince
bagration
inclined
his
head
as
a
sign
that
this
was
all
exactly
as
he
had
wished
and
supposed
turning
to
the
adjutant
he
ordered
him
to
bring
down
from
the
hill
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
which
they
had
just
ridden
past
prince
andrei
was
struck
at
that
moment
by
the
change
that
came
over
prince
bagrations
face
his
face
expressed
that
concentrated
and
happy
resolve
which
occurs
in
a
man
who
is
about
to
throw
himself
into
the
water
on
a
hot
day
and
is
making
a
running
start
neither
the
sleepy
lackluster
eyes
nor
the
falsely
profound
look
was
there
his
round
firm
hawks
eyes
looked
straight
ahead
with
rapture
and
a
certain
disdain
apparently
not
resting
on
anything
though
his
movements
were
as
slow
and
measured
as
before
the
regimental
commander
turned
to
prince
bagration
entreating
him
to
ride
back
because
here
it
was
too
dangerous
please
your
excellency
for
gods
sake
he
repeated
glancing
for
confirmation
at
the
officer
of
the
suite
who
turned
away
from
him
there
kindly
see
he
drew
attention
to
the
bullets
that
constantly
shrieked
sang
and
whistled
around
them
he
spoke
in
the
same
tone
of
entreaty
and
reproach
in
which
a
carpenter
speaks
to
a
gentleman
who
has
picked
up
an
ax
were
used
to
it
but
youll
get
blisters
on
your
hands
he
spoke
as
if
he
himself
could
not
be
killed
by
these
bullets
and
his
halfclosed
eyes
gave
his
words
a
still
more
persuasive
expression
the
staff
officer
joined
in
the
regimental
commanders
admonitions
but
prince
bagration
did
not
respond
to
them
and
merely
ordered
the
men
to
stop
shooting
and
line
up
so
as
to
make
room
for
the
two
expected
battalions
while
he
was
speaking
the
rising
wind
as
with
an
invisible
hand
drew
from
right
to
left
the
curtain
of
smoke
that
had
concealed
the
hollow
and
the
hill
opposite
with
the
french
moving
over
it
opened
out
before
them
all
eyes
were
involuntarily
turned
to
this
french
column
that
was
moving
towards
them
winding
down
the
terraces
of
the
slope
the
soldiers
shaggy
hats
were
already
visible
one
could
already
distinguish
the
officers
from
the
men
one
could
see
their
standard
fluttering
against
its
staff
nice
marching
said
someone
in
bagrations
suite
the
head
of
the
column
was
already
down
in
the
hollow
the
confrontation
was
to
take
place
on
this
side
of
the
slope
the
remnants
of
our
regiment
which
had
been
in
action
lining
up
hastily
moved
to
the
right
from
behind
them
scattering
the
stragglers
came
the
two
battalions
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
in
good
order
they
had
not
yet
reached
bagration
but
one
could
already
hear
the
heavy
weighty
tread
of
a
whole
mass
of
men
marching
in
step
on
the
left
flank
closest
of
all
to
bagration
marched
a
company
commander
a
roundfaced
stately
man
with
a
stupid
happy
expression
on
his
face
the
same
one
who
had
come
running
from
the
leanto
he
was
obviously
thinking
of
nothing
at
that
moment
but
the
fine
figure
he
would
cut
as
he
marched
past
his
superior
with
a
paradelike
selfsatisfaction
he
marched
lightly
on
his
muscular
legs
as
if
floating
holding
himself
straight
without
the
least
effort
and
distinguishing
himself
by
this
lightness
from
the
heavy
tread
of
the
soldiers
who
marched
in
step
with
him
he
carried
by
his
leg
an
unsheathed
thin
and
narrow
sword
a
curved
little
sword
not
resembling
a
weapon
and
he
lithely
turned
his
whole
strong
body
looking
now
at
his
superior
now
behind
him
without
losing
step
it
seemed
that
all
the
forces
of
his
soul
were
aimed
at
marching
past
his
superior
in
the
best
possible
way
and
feeling
that
he
was
doing
it
well
he
was
happy
leftleftleft
he
seemed
to
be
saying
to
himself
at
every
other
step
and
the
wall
of
soldiers
figures
burdened
by
packs
and
muskets
with
variously
stern
faces
moved
to
this
rhythm
as
if
each
of
those
hundreds
of
soldiers
was
mentally
saying
leftleftleft
at
every
other
step
a
fat
major
puffing
and
breaking
the
step
turned
around
a
bush
that
was
in
his
way
a
lagging
soldier
breathless
with
a
frightened
face
because
of
his
negligence
trotted
to
catch
up
with
his
company
a
cannonball
pushing
through
the
air
flew
over
the
heads
of
prince
bagration
and
his
suite
and
to
the
rhythm
of
leftleftleft
struck
the
column
close
ranks
came
the
dashing
voice
of
the
company
commander
the
soldiers
curved
around
something
at
the
spot
where
the
cannonball
had
landed
and
a
decorated
old
soldier
a
sergeant
on
the
flank
after
lingering
by
the
dead
men
caught
up
with
his
line
skipped
to
change
feet
fell
into
step
and
looked
back
angrily
leftleftleft
seemed
to
be
heard
through
the
ominous
silence
and
the
monotonous
sound
of
feet
simultaneously
tramping
the
ground
bravo
lads
said
prince
bagration
glad
to
be
ofyour
exexexexex
rolled
through
the
ranks
a
sullen
soldier
marching
on
the
left
turned
his
eyes
to
bagration
as
he
shouted
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
we
know
it
ourselves
another
without
looking
and
as
if
fearing
to
be
distracted
opened
his
mouth
wide
shouted
and
passed
by
they
were
ordered
to
stop
and
remove
their
packs
bagration
rode
around
the
ranks
that
had
gone
past
him
and
dismounted
he
handed
the
reins
to
a
cossack
removed
and
handed
over
his
felt
cloak
stretched
his
legs
and
straightened
his
peaked
cap
the
head
of
the
french
column
with
officers
in
the
fore
appeared
from
the
bottom
of
the
hill
god
be
with
us
bagration
said
in
a
firm
audible
voice
turned
for
a
moment
to
the
front
line
and
swinging
his
arms
slightly
with
the
awkward
gait
of
a
cavalryman
as
if
working
at
it
he
went
forward
over
the
uneven
field
prince
andrei
felt
that
some
invincible
force
was
drawing
him
forward
and
he
experienced
great
happiness
the
french
were
already
close
walking
beside
bagration
prince
andrei
could
already
make
out
clearly
the
bandoliers
the
red
epaulettes
even
the
faces
of
the
french
he
clearly
saw
one
old
french
officer
walking
uphill
with
difficulty
on
splayed
feet
in
gaiters
holding
on
to
bushes
prince
bagration
gave
no
new
order
and
went
on
walking
silently
in
front
of
the
ranks
suddenly
from
among
the
french
came
the
crack
of
a
shot
a
second
a
thirdand
all
across
the
disordered
enemy
ranks
spread
smoke
and
the
crackle
of
gunfire
several
of
our
men
fell
among
them
the
roundfaced
officer
who
had
marched
so
cheerfully
and
diligently
but
just
as
the
first
shot
rang
out
bagration
turned
around
and
shouted
hurrah
hurraaah
the
prolonged
cry
spread
throughout
our
line
and
outstripping
prince
bagration
and
each
other
in
a
disorderly
but
cheerful
and
lively
crowd
our
men
ran
down
the
hill
after
the
disordered
french
xix
the
attack
of
the
sixth
chasseurs
secured
the
retreat
of
the
right
flank
in
the
center
the
action
of
tushins
forgotten
battery
which
managed
to
set
fire
to
sch246ngraben
stayed
the
movement
of
the
french
the
french
were
putting
out
the
fire
which
was
spread
by
the
wind
and
allowing
time
for
retreat
the
retreat
of
the
center
across
the
ravine
was
hasty
and
noisy
however
the
troops
in
retreating
did
not
mix
up
their
detachments
but
the
left
flank
which
was
simultaneously
being
attacked
and
encircled
by
the
superior
forces
of
the
french
under
lannes
and
which
consisted
of
the
azovsky
and
podolsky
infantry
regiments
and
the
pavlogradsky
hussar
regiment
was
in
disorder
bagration
sent
zherkov
to
the
general
of
the
left
flank
with
an
order
to
retreat
immediately
zherkov
not
taking
his
hand
from
his
cap
briskly
started
his
horse
and
galloped
off
but
as
soon
as
he
left
bagration
his
strength
failed
him
an
insurmountable
fear
came
over
him
and
he
was
unable
to
go
where
there
was
danger
having
reached
the
troops
of
the
left
flank
he
did
not
ride
forward
where
the
shooting
was
but
went
looking
for
the
general
and
the
officers
where
they
could
not
be
and
therefore
did
not
deliver
the
order
the
command
of
the
left
flank
belonged
in
order
of
superiority
to
the
commander
of
the
same
regiment
that
had
been
presented
to
kutuzov
at
braunau
and
in
which
dolokhov
served
as
a
private
but
the
command
of
the
extreme
left
flank
was
given
to
the
commander
of
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
in
which
rostov
served
owing
to
which
a
misunderstanding
arose
the
two
officers
were
greatly
vexed
with
each
other
and
at
a
time
when
action
had
long
since
started
on
the
right
flank
and
the
french
had
already
begun
their
offensive
the
two
officers
were
taken
up
with
an
exchange
which
had
the
aim
of
insulting
each
other
the
regiments
cavalry
as
well
as
infantry
were
very
little
prepared
for
the
forthcoming
action
the
men
of
the
regiments
from
private
to
general
were
not
expecting
a
battle
and
were
calmly
occupied
with
peaceful
matters
feeding
horses
in
the
cavalry
gathering
firewood
in
the
infantry
if
he
however
is
senior
to
mine
in
the
ranking
the
german
hussar
colonel
said
turning
red
and
addressing
an
adjutant
who
had
ridden
up
leave
him
to
do
as
he
wants
i
my
hussars
cannot
sacrifice
bugler
sound
the
retreat
but
things
were
becoming
urgent
cannonades
and
gunfire
blending
rumbled
on
the
right
and
in
the
center
and
the
french
greatcoats
of
lanness
riflemen
were
already
passing
the
mill
dam
and
forming
up
on
this
side
two
musket
shots
away
the
infantry
general
went
up
to
a
horse
with
his
bouncing
gait
mounted
it
becoming
very
straight
and
tall
and
rode
to
the
pavlogradsky
commander
the
regimental
commanders
came
together
with
polite
bows
and
with
concealed
spite
in
their
hearts
once
again
colonel
the
general
said
i
cannot
in
any
case
leave
half
my
men
in
the
woods
i
beg
you
i
beg
you
he
repeated
to
take
up
your
position
and
prepare
for
the
attack
and
i
beg
you
not
to
interfieren
in
vat
is
not
your
business
the
colonel
replied
hotly
if
you
vere
a
cavalryman
i
am
not
a
cavalryman
colonel
but
i
am
a
russian
general
and
if
that
is
not
known
to
you
very
much
known
your
excellency
the
colonel
suddenly
cried
starting
his
horse
and
turning
a
reddish
purple
be
so
kind
please
to
go
to
the
front
and
you
vill
see
that
this
position
is
good
f252r
nothing
i
do
not
vant
to
destroy
my
regiment
f252r
your
pleasure
you
forget
yourself
colonel
i
am
not
concerned
with
my
own
pleasure
and
i
will
not
allow
you
to
say
so
the
general
accepting
the
colonels
invitation
to
a
tournament
of
courage
drew
himself
up
and
frowning
rode
with
him
in
the
direction
of
the
front
as
if
all
their
differences
had
to
be
resolved
there
at
the
front
amidst
the
bullets
they
reached
the
front
several
bullets
flew
over
them
and
they
stopped
in
silence
there
was
nothing
to
look
at
there
because
even
from
the
place
where
they
had
been
standing
before
it
had
been
clear
that
cavalry
could
not
operate
in
the
bushes
and
ravines
and
that
the
french
were
turning
their
left
wing
the
general
and
the
colonel
stared
sternly
and
significantly
at
each
other
like
two
cocks
preparing
to
fight
vainly
waiting
for
signs
of
cowardice
both
passed
the
examination
since
there
was
nothing
to
say
and
neither
of
them
wanted
to
give
the
other
a
pretext
for
claiming
he
had
been
the
first
to
run
away
from
the
bullets
they
would
have
stood
there
for
a
long
time
testing
each
others
courage
if
at
that
moment
in
the
woods
almost
behind
them
there
had
not
come
a
crackle
of
musket
fire
and
a
muffled
merging
cry
the
french
had
attacked
the
soldiers
who
had
gone
there
for
firewood
the
hussars
could
no
longer
retreat
together
with
the
infantry
they
were
cut
off
from
the
path
of
retreat
to
the
left
by
the
french
line
now
however
inconvenient
the
terrain
was
it
was
necessary
to
attack
in
order
to
cut
a
path
for
themselves
the
squadron
in
which
rostov
served
had
just
had
time
to
mount
its
horses
when
it
was
halted
facing
the
enemy
again
as
on
the
enns
bridge
there
was
no
one
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
and
there
lay
between
them
separating
them
that
same
terrible
line
of
the
unknown
and
of
fear
like
the
line
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
all
the
men
sensed
that
line
and
the
question
of
whether
they
would
or
would
not
cross
that
line
and
how
they
would
cross
it
troubled
them
the
colonel
rode
up
to
the
front
angrily
gave
some
answer
to
the
officers
questions
and
like
a
man
desperately
insisting
on
having
his
own
way
gave
some
order
no
one
said
anything
definite
but
the
rumor
of
an
attack
swept
through
the
squadron
the
command
to
form
up
was
heard
then
sabers
shrieked
as
they
were
drawn
from
their
scabbards
but
still
no
one
moved
the
troops
of
the
left
flank
both
infantry
and
hussars
sensed
that
their
superiors
themselves
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
the
indecisiveness
of
the
superiors
communicated
itself
to
the
troops
hurry
up
hurry
up
thought
rostov
sensing
that
the
time
had
come
at
last
to
experience
the
delight
of
an
attack
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
from
his
hussar
comrades
god
be
with
us
lads
denisovs
voice
rang
out
at
a
trot
march
the
croups
of
the
horses
in
the
front
row
moved
little
rook
pulled
at
the
reins
and
started
off
himself
to
the
right
rostov
saw
the
first
rows
of
his
hussars
and
still
further
ahead
he
could
see
a
dark
strip
which
he
could
not
make
out
but
thought
to
be
the
enemy
shots
were
fired
but
in
the
distance
quicken
the
trot
came
the
command
and
rostov
felt
his
little
rook
kick
up
his
rump
switching
to
a
canter
he
guessed
his
movements
ahead
of
time
and
felt
merrier
and
merrier
he
noticed
a
solitary
tree
ahead
this
tree
was
first
ahead
of
him
in
the
middle
of
the
line
that
seemed
so
terrible
but
then
they
crossed
that
line
and
not
only
was
there
nothing
frightening
but
everything
became
merrier
and
livelier
oh
how
im
going
to
slash
at
him
thought
rostov
gripping
the
hilt
of
his
saber
hurrraaah
voices
droned
well
now
let
anybody
at
all
come
along
thought
rostov
spurring
little
rook
and
outstripping
the
others
sending
him
into
a
full
gallop
the
enemy
could
already
be
seen
ahead
suddenly
something
lashed
at
the
squadron
as
if
with
a
broad
besom
rostov
raised
his
sword
preparing
to
strike
but
just
then
the
soldier
nikitenko
galloped
past
leaving
him
behind
and
rostov
felt
as
in
a
dream
that
he
was
still
racing
on
with
unnatural
speed
and
at
the
same
time
was
staying
in
place
the
familiar
hussar
bandarchuk
galloped
towards
him
from
behind
and
looked
at
him
angrily
bandarchuks
horse
shied
and
he
swerved
around
him
what
is
it
im
not
moving
ahead
ive
fallen
ive
been
killed
rostov
asked
and
answered
in
the
same
instant
he
was
alone
now
in
the
middle
of
the
field
instead
of
moving
horses
and
hussar
backs
he
saw
the
immobile
earth
and
stubble
around
him
there
was
warm
blood
under
him
no
im
wounded
and
my
horse
has
been
killed
little
rook
tried
to
get
up
on
his
forelegs
but
fell
back
pinning
his
riders
leg
blood
flowed
from
the
horses
head
the
horse
thrashed
and
could
not
get
up
rostov
went
to
get
up
and
also
fell
his
pouch
caught
on
the
saddle
where
ours
were
where
the
french
werehe
did
not
know
there
was
no
one
around
having
freed
his
leg
he
got
up
where
on
which
side
now
was
that
line
which
had
so
sharply
separated
the
two
armies
he
asked
himself
and
could
not
answer
has
something
bad
happened
to
me
there
are
such
cases
and
what
must
be
done
in
such
cases
he
asked
himself
standing
up
and
just
then
he
felt
that
something
superfluous
was
hanging
from
his
numb
left
arm
his
hand
was
like
someone
elses
he
examined
the
hand
vainly
looking
for
blood
on
it
well
here
are
some
people
he
thought
joyfully
seeing
several
men
running
towards
him
theyll
help
me
in
front
of
these
people
ran
one
in
a
strange
shako
and
a
blue
greatcoat
dark
tanned
with
a
hooked
nose
two
more
and
then
many
came
running
behind
him
one
of
them
said
something
strange
nonrussian
among
the
men
in
the
back
wearing
the
same
shakos
stood
a
russian
hussar
he
was
being
held
by
the
arms
behind
him
they
were
holding
his
horse
he
must
be
one
of
ours
taken
prisoneryes
can
it
be
theyll
take
me
too
what
men
are
these
rostov
kept
thinking
not
believing
his
eyes
can
they
be
frenchmen
he
looked
at
the
approaching
frenchmen
and
though
a
moment
before
he
had
been
galloping
only
in
order
to
meet
these
frenchmen
and
cut
them
to
pieces
their
closeness
now
seemed
so
terrible
to
him
that
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
who
are
they
why
are
they
running
can
it
be
theyre
running
to
me
can
it
be
and
why
to
kill
me
me
whom
everybody
loves
so
he
remembered
his
mothers
love
for
him
his
familys
his
friends
and
the
enemys
intention
to
kill
him
seemed
impossible
but
maybe
evento
kill
me
he
stood
for
more
than
ten
seconds
without
moving
from
the
spot
or
understanding
his
situation
the
first
frenchman
with
the
hooked
nose
came
so
close
that
the
expression
on
his
face
could
already
be
seen
and
the
flushed
alien
physiognomy
of
this
man
who
with
lowered
bayonet
holding
his
breath
was
running
lightly
towards
him
frightened
rostov
he
seized
his
pistol
and
instead
of
firing
it
threw
it
at
the
frenchman
and
ran
for
the
bushes
as
fast
as
he
could
he
ran
not
with
the
feeling
of
doubt
and
conflict
with
which
he
had
gone
to
the
enns
bridge
but
with
the
feeling
of
a
hare
escaping
from
hounds
one
undivided
feeling
of
fear
for
his
young
happy
life
possessed
his
entire
being
quickly
leaping
over
the
hedges
with
that
swiftness
with
which
he
had
run
playing
tag
he
flew
across
the
field
turning
his
pale
kind
young
face
back
from
time
to
time
and
a
chill
of
terror
ran
down
his
spine
no
its
better
not
to
look
he
thought
but
running
up
to
the
bushes
he
turned
once
more
the
frenchmen
lagged
behind
and
even
as
he
looked
back
the
front
one
had
just
changed
his
trot
to
a
walk
and
turning
around
shouted
something
loudly
to
his
comrade
behind
him
rostov
stopped
something
must
be
wrong
he
thought
its
impossible
that
they
should
want
to
kill
me
and
meanwhile
his
left
arm
was
as
heavy
as
though
a
twentypound
weight
was
hanging
from
it
he
could
not
run
any
further
the
frenchman
also
stopped
and
took
aim
rostov
closed
his
eyes
and
crouched
down
one
two
bullets
flew
whistling
past
him
he
gathered
his
last
strength
held
on
to
his
left
arm
with
his
right
hand
and
ran
to
the
bushes
in
the
bushes
there
were
russian
riflemen
xx
the
infantry
regiments
caught
unawares
in
the
woods
ran
out
of
the
woods
and
companies
mixing
with
other
companies
retreated
in
disordered
crowds
one
soldier
uttered
in
fear
the
words
cut
offsenseless
and
terrible
in
time
of
warand
the
words
together
with
the
fear
communicated
themselves
to
the
whole
mass
were
surrounded
cut
off
lost
cried
the
voices
of
running
men
the
regimental
commander
the
moment
he
heard
shooting
and
cries
behind
him
knew
that
something
terrible
had
happened
to
his
regiment
and
the
thought
that
he
an
exemplary
officer
with
many
years
of
service
to
blame
for
nothing
might
be
blamed
before
his
superiors
for
negligence
or
inefficiency
struck
him
so
much
that
at
that
same
moment
forgetting
both
the
disobedient
cavalry
colonel
and
his
own
dignity
as
a
general
and
above
all
totally
forgetting
danger
and
the
sense
of
selfpreservation
he
gripped
the
pommel
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
off
to
his
regiment
under
a
hail
of
bullets
that
poured
down
on
but
luckily
missed
him
he
wanted
one
thing
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
and
help
to
rectify
at
all
costs
any
error
if
there
was
one
on
his
part
so
that
he
an
exemplary
officer
with
twentytwo
years
of
service
and
never
reprimanded
for
anything
would
not
be
blamed
for
it
having
galloped
luckily
through
the
french
he
came
to
the
field
beyond
the
woods
through
which
our
men
were
running
and
disobeying
commands
heading
down
the
hill
that
moment
of
moral
hesitation
came
which
decides
the
fate
of
battles
would
these
disorderly
crowds
of
soldiers
heed
the
voice
of
their
commander
or
look
at
him
and
go
on
running
despite
the
desperate
shouts
of
the
regimental
commander
formerly
so
terrible
for
the
soldiers
despite
the
furious
crimson
face
of
the
regimental
commander
who
no
longer
resembled
himself
and
the
waving
of
his
sword
the
soldiers
went
on
running
talking
firing
into
the
air
and
not
listening
to
his
commands
the
moral
hesitation
that
decides
the
fate
of
battles
was
obviously
being
resolved
in
favor
of
fear
the
general
began
to
choke
from
shouting
and
powder
smoke
and
stopped
in
despair
all
seemed
lost
but
at
that
moment
the
french
who
had
been
advancing
upon
our
men
suddenly
for
no
visible
reason
ran
back
disappeared
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
in
the
woods
russian
riflemen
appeared
this
was
timokhins
company
which
alone
had
kept
its
order
in
the
woods
and
having
hidden
in
a
ditch
nearby
had
unexpectedly
attacked
the
french
timokhin
had
fallen
upon
the
french
with
such
a
desperate
cry
and
such
insane
and
drunken
determination
running
at
the
enemy
with
nothing
but
a
little
sword
that
the
french
having
no
time
to
recover
threw
down
their
arms
and
fled
dolokhov
who
was
running
beside
timokhin
killed
one
frenchman
pointblank
and
was
the
first
to
take
a
surrendering
officer
by
the
collar
the
fleeing
men
returned
the
battalions
formed
up
and
the
french
who
had
divided
the
troops
of
the
left
flank
in
two
were
momentarily
pressed
back
the
reserve
units
had
time
to
join
in
and
the
fleeing
soldiers
stopped
the
regimental
commander
was
standing
by
the
bridge
with
major
ekonomov
letting
the
retreating
companies
pass
by
him
when
a
soldier
came
up
to
him
took
hold
of
his
stirrup
and
almost
leaned
against
him
the
soldier
was
wearing
a
greatcoat
of
bluish
factory
broadcloth
he
had
no
pack
or
shako
his
head
was
bandaged
and
there
was
a
french
ammunition
pouch
slung
over
his
shoulder
in
his
hand
he
was
holding
an
officers
sword
the
soldier
was
pale
his
blue
eyes
looked
insolently
into
the
regimental
commanders
face
and
his
mouth
smiled
though
the
regimental
commander
was
busy
giving
orders
to
major
ekonomov
he
could
not
help
paying
attention
to
this
soldier
your
excellency
here
are
two
trophies
said
dolokhov
pointing
to
the
french
sword
and
pouch
i
captured
an
officer
i
stopped
the
company
dolokhov
was
breathing
heavily
from
fatigue
he
spoke
with
pauses
the
whole
company
can
testify
i
ask
you
to
remember
your
excellency
very
well
very
well
said
the
regimental
commander
and
he
turned
to
major
ekonomov
but
dolokhov
did
not
go
away
he
untied
the
handkerchief
pulled
it
off
and
showed
the
clotted
blood
on
his
head
a
bayonet
wound
i
stayed
at
the
front
remember
your
excellency
tushins
battery
was
forgotten
and
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
action
did
prince
bagration
still
hearing
cannon
fire
from
the
center
send
the
staff
officer
on
duty
there
and
then
prince
andrei
to
order
the
battery
to
retreat
as
quickly
as
possible
the
covering
troops
stationed
next
to
tushins
cannon
had
left
on
somebodys
order
in
the
middle
of
the
action
but
the
battery
went
on
firing
and
was
not
taken
by
the
french
only
because
the
enemy
could
not
suppose
that
such
bold
firing
was
coming
from
four
unprotected
cannon
on
the
contrary
from
the
energetic
operation
of
the
battery
they
supposed
that
the
main
russian
forces
were
concentrated
there
in
the
center
and
they
tried
twice
to
attack
that
point
and
were
driven
off
both
times
by
the
canister
fire
of
the
four
cannon
standing
solitarily
on
the
elevation
soon
after
prince
bagrations
departure
tushin
managed
to
set
fire
to
sch246ngraben
look
theyre
scurrying
around
its
burning
look
at
the
smoke
fine
work
grand
what
smoke
what
smoke
said
the
crews
growing
animated
without
any
order
all
the
cannon
were
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
as
if
egging
it
on
the
soldiers
kept
crying
at
each
shot
fine
work
thats
the
way
just
lookgrand
the
fire
borne
by
the
wind
spread
quickly
the
french
columns
that
had
moved
out
of
the
village
went
back
but
as
if
in
punishment
for
this
failure
the
enemy
set
up
ten
guns
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
began
firing
them
at
tushin
owing
to
the
childlike
joy
aroused
by
the
fire
and
the
excitement
of
their
successful
shooting
at
the
french
our
artillerists
noticed
this
battery
only
when
two
cannonballs
and
then
four
more
landed
among
the
guns
and
one
brought
down
two
horses
and
another
tore
the
leg
off
a
caisson
master
the
animation
once
established
did
not
weaken
however
but
only
changed
in
mood
the
horses
were
replaced
by
others
from
spare
carriages
the
wounded
were
removed
and
the
four
guns
were
turned
against
the
tencannon
battery
an
officer
tushins
comrade
had
been
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
seventeen
out
of
the
forty
men
of
the
gun
crews
had
been
eliminated
yet
the
artillerists
were
still
just
as
merry
and
animated
twice
they
noticed
that
the
french
had
appeared
below
close
to
them
and
then
they
fired
on
them
with
canister
shot
the
small
man
with
weak
awkward
movements
constantly
asked
his
orderly
to
give
him
another
little
pipeful
for
that
as
he
put
it
and
spilling
fire
from
it
ran
forward
and
looked
at
the
french
from
under
his
small
hand
smash
em
lads
he
kept
saying
and
would
seize
the
guns
by
the
wheel
and
unscrew
the
screws
himself
amidst
the
smoke
deafened
by
the
ceaseless
firing
which
made
him
jump
each
time
tushin
without
relinquishing
his
nosewarmer
ran
from
one
gun
to
the
other
now
taking
aim
now
counting
the
charges
now
ordering
the
dead
and
wounded
horses
to
be
changed
and
reharnessed
and
shouting
all
the
while
in
his
weak
high
irresolute
voice
his
face
was
growing
more
and
more
animated
only
when
people
were
killed
or
wounded
he
winced
and
turning
away
from
the
dead
man
shouted
angrily
at
his
crew
who
as
always
were
slow
to
pick
up
a
wounded
man
or
a
body
his
soldiers
for
the
most
handsome
fellows
two
heads
taller
and
twice
as
broad
as
their
officer
as
always
in
a
battery
company
all
looked
to
their
commander
like
children
in
a
difficult
situation
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
inevitably
mirrored
on
theirs
as
a
result
of
the
dreadful
rumbling
the
noise
the
necessity
for
attention
and
activity
tushin
did
not
experience
the
slightest
unpleasant
feeling
of
fear
and
the
thought
that
he
could
be
killed
or
painfully
wounded
did
not
occur
to
him
on
the
contrary
he
felt
ever
merrier
and
merrier
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
moment
when
he
saw
the
enemy
and
fired
the
first
shot
was
already
very
long
ago
maybe
even
yesterday
and
that
the
spot
on
the
field
where
he
stood
was
a
longfamiliar
and
dear
place
to
him
though
he
remembered
everything
considered
everything
did
everything
the
best
officer
could
do
in
his
position
he
was
in
a
state
similar
to
feverish
delirium
or
to
that
of
a
drunken
man
from
the
deafening
noise
of
his
guns
on
all
sides
from
the
whistling
and
thud
of
the
enemys
shells
from
the
sight
of
the
sweaty
flushed
crews
hustling
about
the
guns
from
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
men
and
horses
from
the
sight
of
the
little
puffs
of
smoke
on
the
enemys
side
after
each
of
which
a
cannonball
came
flying
and
hit
the
ground
a
man
a
cannon
or
a
horseowing
to
the
sight
of
all
these
things
there
was
established
in
his
head
a
fantastic
world
of
his
own
which
made
up
his
pleasure
at
that
moment
in
his
imagination
the
enemys
cannon
were
not
cannon
but
pipes
from
which
an
invisible
smoker
released
an
occasional
puff
of
smoke
look
hes
puffing
away
again
tushin
said
to
himself
in
a
whisper
as
a
puff
of
smoke
leaped
from
the
hillside
and
was
borne
leftwards
in
a
strip
by
the
wind
now
wait
for
the
balland
send
it
back
what
orders
your
honor
asked
the
fireworker
who
was
standing
close
to
him
and
heard
him
mutter
something
nothinga
shell
he
replied
now
for
our
matvevna
he
said
to
himself
in
his
imagination
matvevna
was
the
big
cannon
at
the
end
of
ancient
casting
the
french
looked
like
ants
around
their
guns
a
handsome
man
and
a
drunkard
the
number
one
at
the
second
gun
was
known
in
his
world
as
uncle
tushin
looked
at
him
more
often
than
at
the
others
and
rejoiced
at
his
every
movement
the
sound
of
musket
fire
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
now
dying
down
now
intensifying
again
seemed
to
him
like
someones
breathing
he
listened
to
the
fading
and
flaring
up
of
these
sounds
hah
breathing
again
breathing
he
said
to
himself
he
pictured
himself
as
of
enormous
size
a
mighty
man
flinging
cannonballs
at
the
french
with
both
hands
well
matvevna
old
girl
dont
let
us
down
he
said
moving
away
from
the
gun
when
a
strange
unfamiliar
voice
rang
out
over
his
head
captain
tushin
captain
tushin
turned
around
frightened
it
was
the
same
staff
officer
who
had
driven
him
out
of
grunt
he
was
shouting
at
him
in
a
breathless
voice
what
have
you
lost
your
mind
youve
been
ordered
twice
to
retreat
but
you
well
what
are
they
getting
at
me
for
tushin
thought
to
himself
looking
fearfully
at
his
superior
inothing
he
said
putting
two
fingers
to
his
visor
i
but
the
colonel
did
not
finish
everything
he
wanted
to
say
a
cannonball
flew
close
to
him
and
made
him
duck
and
crouch
down
on
his
horse
he
fell
silent
and
was
about
to
say
something
more
when
another
cannonball
stopped
him
he
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
away
retreat
everybody
retreat
he
called
from
the
distance
the
soldiers
laughed
a
moment
later
an
adjutant
arrived
with
the
same
order
this
was
prince
andrei
the
first
thing
he
saw
on
riding
out
into
the
space
occupied
by
tushins
cannon
was
an
unharnessed
horse
with
a
shattered
leg
that
was
whinnying
near
the
harnessed
horses
blood
was
pouring
from
its
leg
as
from
a
spout
among
the
limbers
several
men
lay
dead
one
cannonball
after
another
flew
over
him
as
he
rode
on
and
he
felt
a
nervous
shiver
run
down
his
spine
but
the
thought
alone
that
he
was
afraid
picked
him
up
again
i
cant
be
afraid
he
thought
and
slowly
dismounted
among
the
cannon
he
delivered
the
order
and
did
not
leave
the
battlefield
he
decided
that
the
guns
would
leave
the
position
and
be
taken
away
in
his
presence
together
with
tushin
stepping
over
the
bodies
and
under
the
dreadful
fire
of
the
french
he
got
busy
with
removing
the
guns
another
superior
just
came
and
he
turned
tail
quickly
the
fireworker
said
to
prince
andrei
not
like
your
honor
prince
andrei
said
nothing
to
tushin
the
two
men
were
so
busy
that
they
seemed
not
even
to
see
each
other
having
limbered
up
the
two
remaining
guns
of
the
four
one
smashed
cannon
and
a
unicorn
were
abandoned
prince
andrei
rode
up
to
tushin
well
goodbye
said
prince
andrei
offering
his
hand
to
tushin
goodbye
dear
heart
said
tushin
you
good
soul
goodbye
dear
heart
tushin
said
with
tears
which
for
some
reason
suddenly
came
to
his
eyes
xxi
the
wind
grew
still
black
clouds
hung
low
over
the
place
of
battle
merging
on
the
horizon
with
powder
smoke
it
was
getting
dark
and
the
glow
of
the
fire
showed
more
clearly
in
two
places
the
cannonade
became
weaker
but
the
crackle
of
gunfire
behind
and
to
the
right
was
heard
more
often
and
close
as
soon
as
tushin
with
his
guns
driving
around
or
over
the
wounded
came
out
from
under
fire
and
descended
into
the
ravine
he
met
the
superiors
and
adjutants
among
whom
were
the
staff
officer
and
zherkov
who
had
been
sent
twice
and
had
twice
failed
to
reach
tushins
battery
all
of
them
interrupting
each
other
gave
and
conveyed
orders
of
how
and
where
to
go
and
reproached
and
reprimanded
him
tushin
had
no
orders
to
give
and
rode
silently
behind
them
on
his
artillery
nag
fearing
to
speak
because
he
was
ready
at
every
word
to
burst
into
tears
not
knowing
why
himself
though
the
order
was
to
abandon
the
wounded
many
of
them
dragged
after
the
troops
asking
to
be
put
on
the
guns
the
dashing
infantry
officer
who
had
run
out
of
tushins
leanto
before
the
battle
was
put
on
matvevnas
carriage
a
bullet
in
his
stomach
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
a
pale
hussar
junker
holding
one
arm
with
his
other
hand
came
up
to
tushin
and
asked
for
a
seat
captain
for
gods
sake
ive
bruised
my
arm
he
said
timidly
for
gods
sake
i
cant
walk
for
gods
sake
it
was
clear
that
this
junker
had
already
asked
for
a
seat
more
than
once
elsewhere
and
everywhere
had
been
refused
he
asked
in
an
irresolute
and
pitiful
voice
tell
them
to
give
me
a
seat
for
gods
sake
give
him
a
seat
give
him
a
seat
said
tushin
you
uncle
spread
a
greatcoat
under
him
he
turned
to
his
favorite
soldier
and
wheres
the
wounded
officer
we
unloaded
him
he
died
someone
answered
give
this
one
a
seat
sit
down
my
dear
sit
down
spread
the
greatcoat
under
him
antonov
the
junker
was
rostov
he
was
holding
one
arm
with
the
other
hand
was
pale
and
his
lower
jaw
was
trembling
feverishly
he
was
seated
on
matvevna
the
same
cannon
from
which
they
had
unloaded
the
dead
officer
the
greatcoat
spread
under
him
had
blood
on
it
which
stained
rostovs
breeches
and
hands
what
are
you
wounded
dear
heart
asked
tushin
coming
to
the
cannon
on
which
rostov
was
sitting
no
bruised
why
is
there
blood
on
the
side
plate
asked
tushin
that
officer
bloodied
it
your
honor
the
artillerist
replied
wiping
the
blood
with
the
sleeve
of
his
greatcoat
and
as
if
apologizing
for
the
unclean
state
the
gun
was
in
they
were
barely
able
with
the
help
of
the
infantry
to
get
the
guns
up
the
hill
and
having
reached
the
village
of
guntersdorf
they
halted
it
grew
so
dark
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
the
soldiers
uniforms
from
ten
paces
away
and
the
crossfire
began
to
die
down
suddenly
close
by
on
the
righthand
side
shouts
and
gunfire
were
heard
again
shots
flashed
in
the
darkness
this
was
the
last
attack
of
the
french
which
was
being
fought
off
by
soldiers
sheltering
in
the
village
houses
all
rushed
out
of
the
village
again
but
tushins
guns
could
not
move
and
the
artillerists
tushin
and
the
junker
silently
looked
at
each
other
awaiting
their
fate
the
crossfire
began
to
die
down
and
soldiers
talking
animatedly
poured
out
of
a
side
street
unhurt
petrov
asked
one
we
roasted
em
brother
they
wont
try
that
again
said
another
couldnt
see
a
thing
what
a
roasting
they
gave
their
own
couldnt
see
its
so
dark
brother
got
anything
to
drink
the
french
had
been
beaten
off
for
the
last
time
and
again
in
total
darkness
tushins
guns
as
if
framed
by
the
humming
infantry
moved
on
somewhere
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
gloomy
river
were
flowing
in
the
darkness
all
in
one
direction
with
a
hum
of
whispers
talk
and
the
sounds
of
hooves
and
wheels
in
the
general
hum
the
groans
and
voices
of
the
wounded
sounded
most
clearly
of
all
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
their
groans
seemed
to
fill
all
the
gloom
surrounding
the
troops
their
groans
and
the
gloom
of
that
night
were
one
and
the
same
after
some
time
there
was
a
stir
in
the
moving
crowd
someone
with
a
suite
rode
by
on
a
white
horse
and
said
something
as
he
rode
by
what
did
he
say
where
to
now
a
halt
or
what
did
he
thank
us
or
what
eager
questions
came
from
all
sides
and
the
entire
moving
mass
began
to
push
upon
itself
evidently
those
in
front
had
stopped
and
a
rumor
spread
that
there
was
an
order
to
halt
they
all
halted
where
they
were
in
the
middle
of
the
muddy
road
fires
were
lit
and
the
talk
became
more
audible
captain
tushin
having
given
orders
to
his
company
sent
one
of
the
soldiers
to
look
for
a
dressing
station
or
a
doctor
for
the
junker
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
the
soldiers
had
started
on
the
road
rostov
also
dragged
himself
to
the
fire
a
feverish
trembling
from
pain
cold
and
dampness
shook
his
whole
body
sleep
was
coming
over
him
irresistibly
yet
he
could
not
fall
asleep
from
the
tormenting
pain
in
his
arm
which
ached
and
found
no
comfortable
position
now
he
closed
his
eyes
then
he
gazed
at
the
fire
which
seemed
a
hot
red
to
him
then
at
the
stooping
weak
little
figure
of
tushin
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
turkish
fashion
tushins
large
kind
and
intelligent
eyes
were
directed
at
him
with
compassion
and
commiseration
he
saw
that
tushin
wanted
with
all
his
heart
to
help
him
in
some
way
and
could
not
on
all
sides
one
could
hear
the
footsteps
and
talk
of
the
infantry
walking
driving
and
settling
themselves
around
the
sounds
of
voices
footsteps
and
horses
hooves
treading
in
the
mud
the
crackling
of
firewood
far
and
near
merged
into
one
rippling
hum
now
it
was
not
as
before
an
invisible
river
flowing
in
the
darkness
but
like
a
gloomy
sea
subsiding
and
quivering
after
a
storm
rostov
mindlessly
watched
and
listened
to
what
was
happening
before
him
and
around
him
an
infantryman
came
up
to
the
fire
squatted
down
put
his
hands
to
the
fire
and
turned
his
face
away
you
dont
mind
your
honor
he
said
turning
questioningly
to
tushin
ive
strayed
from
my
company
your
honor
i
dont
know
where
myself
worse
luck
along
with
the
soldier
an
infantry
officer
with
a
bound
cheek
came
up
to
the
campfire
and
addressed
tushin
asking
him
to
move
the
guns
a
little
bit
to
let
his
wagon
pass
after
the
company
commander
two
soldiers
ran
to
the
campfire
they
fought
and
cursed
terribly
pulling
some
boot
from
each
other
sure
you
picked
it
up
what
a
quickfingers
one
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
then
came
a
thin
pale
soldier
his
neck
bandaged
with
a
bloody
footcloth
and
in
an
angry
voice
demanded
water
from
the
artillerists
what
is
a
man
to
die
like
a
dog
he
said
tushin
ordered
them
to
give
him
water
then
a
merry
soldier
ran
up
asking
for
a
little
fire
for
the
infantry
some
hot
little
fire
for
the
infantry
keep
well
dear
countrymen
thanks
for
the
fire
well
pay
it
back
with
interest
he
said
carrying
the
burning
brand
somewhere
into
the
darkness
after
this
soldier
four
soldiers
carrying
something
heavy
on
a
greatcoat
passed
by
the
campfire
one
of
them
tripped
the
devils
left
firewood
on
the
road
he
growled
hes
dead
why
carry
him
around
asked
one
of
them
eh
you
and
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
burden
what
it
hurts
tushin
asked
rostov
in
a
whisper
yes
the
general
wants
you
your
honor
hes
staying
in
a
cottage
here
said
the
fireworker
coming
up
to
tushin
at
once
dear
heart
tushin
got
up
and
buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
smoothing
himself
out
left
the
campfire
not
far
from
the
artillerists
campfire
in
a
cottage
prepared
for
him
prince
bagration
was
sitting
over
dinner
talking
with
some
commanders
of
branches
who
had
gathered
with
him
there
was
the
little
old
man
with
halfclosed
eyes
greedily
gnawing
on
a
lamb
bone
and
the
twentytwoyear
irreproachable
general
flushed
from
a
glass
of
vodka
and
dinner
and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
ring
and
zherkov
looking
around
uneasily
at
them
all
and
prince
andrei
pale
with
compressed
lips
and
feverishly
shining
eyes
in
the
corner
of
the
cottage
stood
a
captured
french
standard
and
the
auditor
with
the
na239ve
face
fingered
the
fabric
of
the
standard
and
shook
his
head
in
perplexity
perhaps
because
he
was
indeed
interested
in
the
look
of
the
standard
or
perhaps
because
it
was
hard
for
him
hungry
as
he
was
to
look
at
the
table
where
there
was
no
place
set
for
him
in
the
cottage
next
door
was
a
french
colonel
taken
prisoner
by
the
dragoons
our
officers
clustered
around
him
studying
him
prince
bagration
thanked
particular
superiors
and
asked
for
details
about
the
action
and
the
losses
the
regimental
commander
who
had
been
reviewed
at
braunau
reported
to
the
prince
that
as
soon
as
the
action
began
he
withdrew
from
the
woods
gathered
the
woodcutters
and
letting
them
pass
by
him
started
a
bayonet
attack
with
two
battalions
and
overwhelmed
the
french
as
soon
as
i
saw
that
the
first
battalion
was
in
disorder
your
excellency
i
stood
there
on
the
road
and
thought
ill
let
them
pass
and
then
meet
them
with
ranged
fire
and
thats
what
i
did
the
regimental
commander
had
so
wanted
to
do
that
he
had
been
so
sorry
that
he
had
had
no
time
to
do
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
this
was
exactly
so
and
perhaps
it
really
was
so
as
if
one
could
make
out
in
that
confusion
what
was
and
was
not
so
with
that
i
must
observe
your
excellency
he
went
on
remembering
dolokhovs
conversation
with
kutuzov
and
his
own
last
encounter
with
the
demoted
soldier
that
the
demoted
private
dolokhov
before
my
eyes
took
a
french
officer
prisoner
and
particularly
distinguished
himself
and
i
also
saw
the
attack
of
the
pavlogradsky
hussars
your
excellency
interrupted
zherkov
looking
around
uneasily
though
he
had
not
seen
any
hussars
that
day
but
had
only
heard
about
them
from
an
infantry
officer
they
broke
two
squares
your
excellency
some
smiled
at
zherkovs
words
expecting
a
joke
from
him
as
usual
but
noticing
that
what
he
said
also
contributed
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
of
that
day
they
assumed
serious
expressions
though
many
knew
very
well
that
what
zherkov
had
said
was
a
lie
with
no
foundation
at
all
prince
bagration
turned
to
the
little
old
colonel
i
thank
you
all
gentlemen
all
the
branches
acted
heroically
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
how
is
it
that
two
guns
in
the
center
were
abandoned
he
asked
seeking
someone
with
his
eyes
prince
bagration
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
of
the
left
flank
he
already
knew
that
all
the
cannon
there
had
been
abandoned
at
the
very
beginning
i
asked
you
to
go
i
believe
he
turned
to
the
staff
officer
on
duty
one
was
knocked
out
the
staff
officer
replied
but
i
cannot
understand
about
the
other
i
was
there
myself
all
the
while
and
giving
orders
and
i
had
only
just
leftit
was
hot
to
tell
the
truth
he
added
modestly
someone
said
that
captain
tushin
was
there
near
the
village
and
had
already
been
sent
for
you
were
there
too
said
prince
bagration
turning
to
prince
andrei
of
course
we
nearly
ran
into
each
other
said
the
staff
officer
on
duty
smiling
pleasantly
at
bolkonsky
i
did
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
prince
andrei
said
coldly
and
abruptly
they
all
fell
silent
tushin
appeared
in
the
doorway
timidly
making
his
way
from
behind
the
generals
backs
going
around
the
generals
in
the
crowded
cottage
embarrassed
as
usual
at
the
sight
of
his
superiors
tushin
did
not
see
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
stumbled
over
it
several
voices
laughed
how
is
it
that
a
gun
was
abandoned
asked
bagration
frowning
not
so
much
at
the
captain
as
at
those
who
laughed
among
whom
zherkovs
voice
sounded
louder
than
the
others
only
now
at
the
sight
of
his
dread
superiors
did
tushin
realize
in
all
its
horror
his
guilt
and
disgrace
at
having
remained
alive
while
losing
two
guns
he
had
been
so
agitated
that
until
that
moment
he
had
not
managed
to
think
of
it
the
laughter
of
the
officers
threw
him
off
still
more
he
stood
before
bagration
with
a
trembling
lower
jaw
and
was
barely
able
to
say
i
dont
knowyour
excellencyi
had
no
men
your
excellency
you
could
have
taken
some
of
the
covering
troops
tushin
did
not
tell
him
that
there
were
no
covering
troops
though
that
was
the
plain
truth
he
was
afraid
to
let
down
another
officer
that
way
and
silently
with
fixed
eyes
looked
straight
into
bagrations
face
as
a
confused
student
looks
into
his
examiners
eyes
the
silence
was
rather
prolonged
prince
bagration
probably
unwilling
to
be
severe
could
not
find
what
to
say
the
rest
did
not
dare
mix
into
the
conversation
prince
andrei
looked
at
tushin
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
his
fingers
twitched
nervously
your
excellency
prince
andrei
broke
the
silence
with
his
sharp
voice
you
were
pleased
to
send
me
to
captain
tushins
battery
i
was
there
and
found
twothirds
of
the
men
and
horses
killed
two
guns
crippled
and
no
cover
at
all
prince
bagration
and
tushin
now
looked
with
the
same
intentness
at
bolkonsky
who
was
speaking
with
restraint
and
agitation
and
if
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
voice
my
opinion
he
went
on
we
owe
the
success
of
the
day
most
of
all
to
the
operation
of
this
battery
and
the
heroic
endurance
of
captain
tushin
and
his
company
said
prince
andrei
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
got
up
at
once
and
stepped
away
from
the
table
prince
bagration
looked
at
tushin
and
obviously
not
wishing
to
show
any
mistrust
of
bolkonskys
sharp
judgment
and
at
the
same
time
feeling
himself
unable
to
believe
him
fully
inclined
his
head
and
told
tushin
he
could
go
prince
andrei
went
out
after
him
thank
you
dear
heart
you
rescued
me
tushin
said
to
him
prince
andrei
looked
at
tushin
and
saying
nothing
walked
away
prince
andrei
felt
sad
and
downhearted
all
this
was
so
strange
so
unlike
what
he
had
hoped
for
who
are
they
why
are
they
here
what
do
they
want
and
when
will
it
all
end
thought
rostov
looking
at
the
shifting
shadows
before
him
the
pain
in
his
arm
was
becoming
more
and
more
tormenting
sleep
drew
him
irresistibly
red
circles
danced
before
his
eyes
and
the
impressions
of
those
voices
and
those
faces
and
a
feeling
of
loneliness
merged
with
the
feeling
of
pain
it
was
they
these
soldiers
wounded
and
not
woundedit
was
they
who
crushed
and
weighed
down
and
twisted
the
sinews
and
burned
the
flesh
of
his
racked
arm
and
shoulder
to
get
rid
of
them
he
closed
his
eyes
he
became
oblivious
for
a
moment
but
in
that
brief
interval
of
oblivion
he
saw
a
numberless
multitude
of
things
in
a
dream
he
saw
his
mother
and
her
large
white
hand
saw
sonyas
thin
little
shoulders
natashas
eyes
and
laughter
and
denisov
with
his
voice
and
mustache
and
telyanin
and
his
whole
story
with
telyanin
and
bogdanych
that
whole
story
was
the
same
as
this
soldier
with
the
sharp
voice
and
that
whole
story
and
this
soldier
were
what
held
crushed
and
pulled
his
arm
to
one
side
so
painfully
and
relentlessly
he
tried
to
get
away
from
them
but
they
would
not
let
go
of
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
for
a
split
second
it
would
not
hurt
it
would
be
well
if
they
were
not
pulling
on
it
but
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
them
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
the
black
canopy
of
the
night
hung
three
feet
above
the
light
from
the
coals
a
dust
of
falling
snow
flew
through
that
light
tushin
did
not
return
the
doctor
did
not
come
he
was
alone
only
some
little
soldier
now
sat
naked
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
warming
his
thin
yellow
body
nobody
needs
me
thought
rostov
theres
nobody
to
help
me
or
pity
me
and
once
i
was
at
home
strong
cheerful
loved
he
sighed
and
involuntarily
groaned
as
he
sighed
ouch
it
hurts
eh
the
little
soldier
asked
waving
his
shirt
over
the
fire
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
grunted
and
said
quite
a
few
folk
got
damaged
todayawful
rostov
was
not
listening
to
the
soldier
he
looked
at
the
snowflakes
dancing
above
the
fire
and
remembered
the
russian
winter
with
a
warm
bright
house
a
fluffy
fur
coat
swift
sleighs
a
healthy
body
and
all
the
love
and
care
of
a
family
and
why
did
i
come
here
he
wondered
the
next
day
the
french
did
not
renew
the
attack
and
the
remnant
of
bagrations
detachment
joined
kutuzovs
army
i
prince
vassily
did
not
think
out
his
plans
still
less
did
he
think
of
doing
people
harm
in
order
to
profit
from
it
he
was
simply
a
man
of
the
world
who
succeeded
in
the
world
and
made
a
habit
of
that
success
according
to
his
circumstances
and
his
intimacy
with
people
he
constantly
formed
various
plans
and
schemes
which
he
himself
was
not
quite
aware
of
but
which
constituted
all
the
interest
of
his
life
he
would
have
not
one
or
two
of
these
plans
and
schemes
going
but
dozens
of
which
some
were
only
beginning
to
take
shape
for
him
while
others
were
coming
to
completion
and
still
others
were
abolished
he
did
not
say
to
himself
for
instance
here
is
a
man
who
is
now
in
power
i
must
gain
his
trust
and
friendship
and
through
him
arrange
for
myself
the
payment
of
a
onetime
subsidy
nor
did
he
say
to
himself
here
pierre
is
rich
i
must
entice
him
to
marry
my
daughter
and
borrow
the
forty
thousand
that
i
need
from
him
but
let
him
meet
a
man
in
power
and
in
the
same
moment
his
instinct
would
tell
him
that
the
man
might
be
useful
and
prince
vassily
would
become
intimate
with
him
and
at
the
first
opportunity
without
any
preparation
instinctively
would
flatter
him
behave
familiarly
talk
about
what
was
needed
he
had
pierre
at
hand
in
moscow
and
prince
vassily
arranged
for
him
an
appointment
as
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
which
was
then
equal
to
the
rank
of
state
councillor
and
insisted
that
the
young
man
should
go
with
him
to
petersburg
and
stay
in
his
house
as
if
absentmindedly
and
at
the
same
time
with
an
indubitable
assurance
that
it
had
to
be
so
prince
vassily
did
everything
necessary
to
have
pierre
marry
his
daughter
if
prince
vassily
had
thought
out
his
plans
beforehand
he
would
not
have
had
such
naturalness
in
his
dealings
and
such
simplicity
and
familiarity
in
his
relations
with
all
people
whether
of
higher
or
lower
station
than
himself
something
constantly
drew
him
to
people
more
powerful
or
richer
than
he
and
he
was
endowed
with
the
rare
art
of
seizing
the
precise
moment
when
he
should
and
could
make
use
of
people
pierre
on
unexpectedly
becoming
a
rich
man
and
count
bezukhov
felt
himself
after
his
recent
solitary
and
carefree
life
so
surrounded
so
taken
up
that
it
was
only
in
bed
that
he
managed
to
remain
alone
with
himself
he
had
to
sign
papers
communicate
with
government
offices
of
whose
significance
he
had
no
clear
notion
ask
his
chief
steward
about
something
go
to
his
estate
near
moscow
and
receive
a
host
of
persons
who
formerly
did
not
even
care
to
know
of
his
existence
but
who
now
would
be
hurt
and
chagrined
if
he
did
not
wish
to
see
them
all
these
various
personsbusiness
connections
relations
acquaintanceswere
equally
well
and
benignly
disposed
towards
the
young
heir
they
were
all
obviously
and
indubitably
convinced
of
pierres
high
merits
he
so
constantly
heard
the
words
with
your
extraordinary
kindness
or
with
your
excellent
heart
or
you
yourself
count
are
so
pure
or
if
he
were
as
intelligent
as
you
are
and
so
on
that
he
was
sincerely
beginning
to
believe
in
his
extraordinary
kindness
and
his
extraordinary
intelligence
the
more
so
because
deep
in
his
heart
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
was
very
kind
and
very
intelligent
even
people
who
had
formerly
been
wicked
and
obviously
hostile
became
affectionate
and
loving
with
him
the
angry
older
princess
with
the
long
waist
and
hair
slicked
down
like
a
dolls
came
to
pierres
room
after
the
funeral
lowering
her
eyes
and
blushing
constantly
she
told
him
that
she
was
very
sorry
about
the
past
misunderstandings
between
them
and
that
she
now
felt
she
had
no
right
to
ask
for
anything
except
permission
after
the
blow
she
had
suffered
to
stay
on
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
house
in
which
she
had
loved
so
much
and
sacrificed
so
much
she
could
not
help
herself
and
wept
at
these
words
touched
to
see
that
this
statuelike
princess
could
change
so
much
pierre
took
her
by
the
hand
and
apologized
not
knowing
for
what
himself
since
that
day
the
princess
had
begun
to
knit
a
striped
scarf
for
pierre
and
was
totally
changed
towards
him
do
it
for
her
mon
cher
after
all
she
suffered
much
from
the
deceased
prince
vassily
said
to
him
handing
him
some
paper
to
sign
for
the
princesss
benefit
prince
vassily
had
decided
that
they
had
to
throw
this
bone
a
promissory
note
for
thirty
thousand
to
the
poor
princess
so
that
she
would
not
take
it
into
her
head
to
talk
about
prince
vassilys
the
affair
of
the
inlaid
portfolio
pierre
had
signed
the
promissory
note
and
since
then
the
princess
had
become
still
kinder
the
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
with
him
especially
the
youngest
the
pretty
one
with
the
little
mole
who
often
confused
pierre
with
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
on
seeing
him
it
seemed
so
natural
to
pierre
that
everyone
should
love
him
it
would
have
seemed
so
unnatural
if
someone
did
not
love
him
that
he
could
not
help
believing
in
the
sincerity
of
the
people
around
him
besides
he
had
no
time
to
ask
himself
about
the
sincerity
or
insincerity
of
these
people
he
was
constantly
busy
he
constantly
felt
himself
in
a
state
of
mild
and
merry
intoxication
he
felt
himself
the
center
of
some
important
general
movement
felt
that
something
was
constantly
expected
of
him
that
if
he
were
to
fail
to
do
this
or
that
he
would
upset
many
people
and
deprive
them
of
what
they
expected
but
if
he
were
to
do
this
or
that
all
would
be
welland
he
did
what
was
demanded
of
him
but
this
well
always
remained
ahead
of
him
more
than
anyone
else
during
this
first
time
it
was
prince
vassily
who
took
possession
both
of
pierres
affairs
and
of
pierre
himself
since
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
he
never
let
pierre
out
of
his
hands
prince
vassily
had
the
look
of
a
man
burdened
by
affairs
weary
exhausted
but
finally
unable
out
of
compassion
to
leave
to
the
mercies
of
fate
and
of
swindlers
this
helpless
youth
his
friends
son
apr232s
tout
and
with
such
an
immense
fortune
in
those
few
days
he
spent
in
moscow
after
count
bezukhovs
death
he
summoned
pierre
to
him
or
went
to
him
himself
and
prescribed
for
him
what
was
to
be
done
in
such
a
tone
of
weariness
and
assurance
as
if
he
were
adding
each
time
vous

que
je

et
que

que
ce
que
je
vous
propose
est
la
seule

faisable
well
my
friend
tomorrow
were
off
at
last
he
said
to
him
one
day
closing
his
eyes
fingering
pierres
elbow
and
in
such
a
tone
as
if
what
he
said
had
been
decided
between
them
long
long
ago
and
could
not
have
been
decided
otherwise
tomorrow
were
off
im
giving
you
a
place
in
my
carriage
im
very
glad
weve
finished
everything
that
matters
here
i
should
have
left
long
ago
i
have
received
this
from
the
chancellor
i
solicited
him
on
your
behalf
and
youve
been
enrolled
in
the
diplomatic
corps
and
made
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
now
the
diplomatic
path
is
open
to
you
despite
all
the
force
of
the
weary
and
assured
tone
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
pierre
who
had
been
thinking
for
so
long
about
his
career
was
about
to
object
but
prince
vassily
interrupted
him
in
that
cooing
bassvoiced
tone
which
precluded
the
possibility
of
interrupting
his
speech
and
which
he
made
use
of
in
cases
requiring
extreme
persuasiveness
mais
mon
cher
i
did
it
for
myself
for
my
conscience
and
theres
nothing
to
thank
me
for
no
one
ever
complained
about
being
loved
too
much
and
besides
youre
free
you
can
drop
it
tomorrow
youll
see
everything
for
yourself
in
petersburg
and
its
long
since
time
that
you
distanced
yourself
from
these
terrible
memories
prince
vassily
sighed
yes
yes
dear
heart
and
let
my
valet
ride
in
your
carriage
ah
i
nearly
forgot
prince
vassily
added
you
know
mon
cher
i
had
some
accounts
with
the
deceased
so
ill
keep
what
i
received
from
ryazan
you
dont
need
it
well
work
it
out
later
what
prince
vassily
referred
to
as
received
from
ryazan
was
several
thousand
in
quitrent
which
prince
vassily
kept
for
himself
in
petersburg
just
as
in
moscow
an
atmosphere
of
affectionate
loving
people
surrounded
pierre
he
could
not
refuse
the
post
or
rather
the
rank
because
he
did
nothing
that
prince
vassily
had
provided
him
with
and
the
acquaintances
invitations
social
occupations
were
so
many
that
pierre
experienced
even
more
than
in
moscow
a
feeling
of
fogginess
hurriedness
and
some
ever
approaching
but
never
attained
good
of
his
former
bachelor
company
many
were
not
in
petersburg
the
guards
had
left
on
campaign
dolokhov
had
been
demoted
anatole
was
in
the
army
in
the
provinces
prince
andrei
was
abroad
and
therefore
pierre
had
no
chance
either
to
spend
the
nights
as
he
had
liked
to
spend
them
before
or
to
ease
his
heart
in
a
friendly
conversation
with
an
older
respected
friend
all
his
time
was
spent
on
dinners
balls
and
mostly
at
prince
vassilysin
the
company
of
the
old
fat
princess
his
wife
and
the
beautiful
h233l232ne
anna
pavlovna
scherer
like
the
others
manifested
to
pierre
the
change
that
had
occurred
in
societys
view
of
him
formerly
in
anna
pavlovnas
presence
pierre
had
constantly
felt
that
what
he
said
was
improper
tactless
out
of
place
that
his
remarks
which
seemed
clever
to
him
while
he
was
preparing
them
in
his
imagination
became
stupid
as
soon
as
he
spoke
them
aloud
and
that
on
the
contrary
the
dullest
remarks
of
ippolit
came
out
as
clever
and
pleasing
now
everything
he
said
came
out
as
charmant
even
if
anna
pavlovna
did
not
say
it
he
could
see
that
she
wanted
to
say
it
and
only
restrained
herself
out
of
respect
for
his
modesty
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
18051806
pierre
received
the
customary
pink
note
from
anna
pavlovna
with
an
invitation
to
which
was
added
vous
trouverez
chez
moi
la
belle
h233l232ne
quon
ne
se
lasse
jamais
voir
reading
this
passage
pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
between
him
and
h233l232ne
some
sort
of
connection
had
been
formed
recognized
by
other
people
and
this
thought
at
the
same
time
frightened
him
as
if
an
obligation
had
been
laid
upon
him
which
he
could
not
fulfill
and
also
pleased
him
as
an
amusing
supposition
the
soir233e
at
anna
pavlovnas
was
the
same
as
the
first
only
the
novelty
that
anna
pavlovna
was
now
treating
her
guests
to
was
not
mortemart
but
a
diplomat
who
had
come
from
berlin
and
brought
the
freshest
details
about
the
emperor
alexanders
visit
to
potsdam
and
the
two
august
friends
swearing
an
indissoluble
union
in
defending
the
right
cause
against
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
pierre
was
received
by
anna
pavlovna
with
a
tinge
of
sorrow
which
obviously
referred
to
the
fresh
loss
that
had
befallen
the
young
man
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
everyone
constantly
considered
it
their
duty
to
convince
pierre
that
he
was
very
grieved
by
the
death
of
a
father
he
had
hardly
knownand
the
sorrow
was
of
the
same
sort
as
that
supreme
sorrow
which
was
expressed
at
the
mention
of
the
august
empress
maria
feodorovna
pierre
felt
flattered
by
it
anna
pavlovna
arranged
the
circles
in
her
drawing
room
with
her
usual
artfulness
the
large
circle
where
prince
vassily
and
the
generals
were
had
use
of
the
diplomat
another
circle
was
formed
by
the
tea
table
pierre
wanted
to
join
the
first
but
anna
pavlovna
who
was
in
the
excited
state
of
a
commander
on
the
battlefield
when
thousands
of
brilliant
new
thoughts
come
along
which
one
scarcely
has
time
to
bring
to
fulfullmentanna
pavlovna
seeing
pierre
touched
his
sleeve
with
her
finger
attendez
jai
des
vues
sur
vous
pour
ce
soir
she
glanced
at
h233l232ne
and
smiled
at
her
ma
bonne
h233l232ne
il
faut
que
vous
soyez
charitable
pour
ma
pauvre
tante
qui
a
une
adoration
pour
vous
allez
lui
tenir
companie
pour
dix
minutes
and
so
that
it
wont
be
too
boring
for
you
here
you
have
the
dear
count
who
will
not
refuse
to
follow
you
the
beauty
went
to
the
aunt
but
anna
pavlovna
kept
pierre
by
her
making
it
look
as
though
she
had
to
give
some
last
necessary
instructions
shes
ravishing
isnt
she
she
said
to
pierre
pointing
to
the
majestic
beauty
as
she
sailed
off
et
quelle
tenue
what
tact
for
such
a
young
girl
and
what
a
masterly
ability
to
behave
it
comes
from
the
heart
happy
the
one
to
whom
she
will
belong
with
her
even
the
most
unworldly
husband
will
involuntarily
and
effortlessly
occupy
a
brilliant
place
in
society
isnt
that
so
i
only
wanted
to
know
your
opinion
and
anna
pavlovna
let
pierre
go
pierre
was
sincere
in
answering
affirmatively
anna
pavlovnas
question
about
the
artfulness
of
h233l232nes
behavior
if
he
ever
thought
about
h233l232ne
he
thought
precisely
about
her
beauty
and
that
extraordinary
calm
ability
of
hers
to
be
silently
dignified
in
society
the
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
in
her
corner
but
it
seemed
wished
to
hide
her
adoration
of
h233l232ne
and
rather
wished
to
show
her
fear
before
anna
pavlovna
she
glanced
at
her
niece
as
if
asking
what
she
was
to
do
with
these
people
as
she
was
leaving
them
anna
pavlovna
again
touched
pierres
sleeve
with
her
finger
and
said
jesp232re
que
vous
ne
direz
plus
quon
sennui
chez
moi
and
she
glanced
at
h233l232ne
h233l232ne
smiled
with
an
air
that
said
she
did
not
allow
the
possibility
that
anyone
could
see
her
and
not
feel
admiration
the
aunt
cleared
her
throat
swallowed
her
saliva
and
said
in
french
that
she
was
very
glad
to
see
h233l232ne
then
she
turned
to
pierre
with
the
same
greeting
and
the
same
mien
in
the
middle
of
the
boring
and
faltering
conversation
h233l232ne
glanced
at
pierre
and
smiled
at
him
that
serene
beautiful
smile
which
she
smiled
at
everyone
pierre
was
so
used
to
that
smile
it
said
so
little
to
him
that
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
the
aunt
was
talking
just
then
about
a
collection
of
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
to
pierres
late
father
count
bezukhov
and
she
showed
her
own
snuffbox
princess
h233l232ne
asked
to
see
the
portrait
of
the
aunts
husband
which
was
painted
on
this
snuffbox
it
must
be
the
work
of
vinesse
said
pierre
naming
a
famous
miniaturist
leaning
towards
the
table
in
order
to
take
the
snuffbox
in
his
hands
and
listening
to
the
conversation
at
the
other
table
he
got
up
wishing
to
go
around
but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
snuffbox
right
over
h233l232ne
behind
her
back
h233l232ne
leaned
forward
so
as
to
make
room
and
smiling
glanced
around
as
always
at
soir233es
she
was
wearing
a
gown
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
quite
open
in
front
and
back
her
bust
which
had
always
looked
like
marble
to
pierre
was
now
such
a
short
distance
from
him
that
he
could
involuntarily
make
out
with
his
nearsighted
eyes
the
living
loveliness
of
her
shoulders
and
neck
and
so
close
to
his
lips
that
he
had
only
to
lean
forward
a
little
to
touch
her
he
sensed
the
warmth
of
her
body
the
smell
of
her
perfume
and
the
creaking
of
her
corset
as
she
breathed
he
saw
not
her
marble
beauty
which
made
one
with
her
gown
he
saw
and
sensed
all
the
loveliness
of
her
body
which
was
merely
covered
by
clothes
and
once
he
had
seen
it
he
could
not
see
otherwise
as
we
cannot
return
to
a
onceexposed
deception
she
turned
looked
straight
at
him
with
her
shining
dark
eyes
and
smiled
so
you
never
noticed
before
how
beautiful
i
am
h233l232ne
seemed
to
say
you
never
noticed
that
i
am
a
woman
yes
i
am
a
woman
who
could
belong
to
anyone
even
you
said
her
gaze
and
at
that
moment
pierre
felt
that
h233l232ne
not
only
could
but
must
be
his
wife
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
he
knew
it
at
that
moment
as
certainly
as
he
would
have
known
it
standing
at
the
altar
with
her
how
it
would
be
and
when
he
did
not
know
he
did
not
even
know
whether
it
would
be
good
he
even
felt
that
it
was
not
good
for
some
reason
but
he
knew
that
it
would
be
pierre
lowered
his
eyes
raised
them
again
and
wanted
to
see
her
once
more
as
a
distant
alien
beauty
the
way
he
had
seen
her
every
day
before
then
but
he
could
no
longer
do
that
could
not
just
as
a
man
who
once
looked
at
a
stalk
of
tall
grass
in
the
mist
and
saw
it
as
a
tree
can
look
at
the
stalk
of
grass
itself
and
once
more
see
it
as
a
tree
she
was
terribly
close
to
him
she
already
had
power
over
him
and
there
were
no
longer
any
obstructions
between
them
except
for
the
obstruction
of
his
own
will
bon
je
vous
laisse
dans
votre
petit
coin
je
vois
que
vous
y
234tes
tr232s
bien
said
the
voice
of
anna
pavlovna
and
pierre
trying
fearfully
to
recall
whether
he
had
done
anything
reprehensible
blushed
and
looked
around
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
as
well
as
he
did
a
short
time
later
when
he
went
up
to
the
large
circle
anna
pavlovna
said
to
him
on
dit
que
vous
embellisez
votre
maison
de
p233tersbourg
that
was
true
the
architect
had
said
it
was
needed
and
pierre
not
knowing
why
himself
was
redecorating
his
enormous
house
in
petersburg
cest
bien
mais
ne
d233m233nagez
pas
de
chez
le
prince
basile
il
est
bon
davoir
un
ami
comme
le
prince
she
said
smiling
at
prince
vassily
jen
sais
quelque
chose
nestce
pas
and
youre
still
so
young
you
need
advice
youre
not
angry
with
me
for
exercising
an
old
womans
rights
she
paused
as
women
always
pause
and
wait
for
something
after
referring
to
their
age
if
you
get
married
thats
another
matter
and
she
united
them
in
a
single
glance
pierre
did
not
look
at
h233l232ne
nor
she
at
him
but
she
was
still
just
as
terribly
close
to
him
he
mumbled
something
and
blushed
on
returning
home
pierre
could
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
time
thinking
about
what
had
happened
to
him
and
what
had
happened
to
him
nothing
he
had
simply
realized
that
a
woman
he
had
known
as
a
child
of
whom
he
used
to
say
distractedly
yes
goodlooking
when
told
that
h233l232ne
was
a
beautyhe
had
realized
that
this
woman
could
belong
to
him
but
shes
stupid
ive
said
myself
that
shes
stupid
he
thought
this
isnt
love
on
the
contrary
theres
something
vile
in
the
feeling
she
aroused
in
me
something
forbidden
ive
been
told
that
her
brother
anatole
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
with
him
and
there
was
a
whole
story
and
thats
why
anatole
was
sent
away
ippolit
is
her
brother
prince
vassily
is
her
father
its
not
good
he
thought
but
while
he
was
arguing
like
that
these
arguments
were
left
unfinished
he
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
aware
that
a
whole
series
of
arguments
had
floated
up
from
behind
the
others
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
thinking
about
her
worthlessness
and
dreaming
of
how
she
would
be
his
wife
how
she
might
come
to
love
him
how
she
might
be
quite
different
and
how
everything
he
had
thought
and
heard
about
her
might
be
untrue
and
again
he
saw
her
not
as
some
daughter
of
prince
vassily
but
saw
her
whole
body
merely
covered
by
a
gray
dress
but
no
why
did
this
thought
not
occur
to
me
before
and
again
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
there
would
be
something
vile
unnatural
as
it
seemed
to
him
and
dishonest
in
this
marriage
he
recalled
her
former
words
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
of
those
who
had
seen
them
together
he
recalled
the
words
and
looks
of
anna
pavlovna
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
his
house
recalled
hundreds
of
similar
hints
from
prince
vassily
and
others
and
terror
came
over
him
at
the
thought
that
he
might
already
have
bound
himself
in
some
way
to
go
through
with
something
which
was
obviously
not
good
and
which
he
ought
not
to
do
but
while
he
expressed
this
realization
to
himself
on
the
other
side
of
his
soul
her
image
floated
up
in
all
its
feminine
beauty
ii
in
november
of
1805
prince
vassily
was
to
go
to
inspect
four
provinces
he
arranged
this
assignment
for
himself
so
as
to
visit
his
disordered
estates
at
the
same
time
and
having
picked
up
his
son
anatole
where
his
regiment
was
stationed
to
go
with
him
to
see
prince
nikolai
andreevich
bolkonsky
in
order
to
marry
his
son
to
the
daughter
of
this
rich
old
man
but
before
his
departure
and
these
new
affairs
prince
vassily
had
to
decide
things
with
pierre
who
of
late
had
indeed
been
spending
whole
days
at
home
that
is
at
prince
vassilys
where
he
lived
and
who
was
ridiculous
agitated
and
stupid
as
a
man
in
love
ought
to
be
in
h233l232nes
presence
but
had
still
not
made
a
proposal
tout
231a
est
bel
et
bon
mais
il
faut
que
231a
finisse
prince
vassily
said
to
himself
one
morning
with
a
sad
sigh
conscious
that
pierre
who
owed
so
much
to
him
well
christ
be
with
him
was
not
quite
acting
properly
in
this
matter
youthfrivolitywell
god
be
with
him
thought
prince
vassily
pleasantly
aware
of
his
kindness
mais
il
faut
que
231a
finisse
the
day
after
tomorrow
is
lelyas
name
day
ill
invite
people
and
if
he
doesnt
understand
what
he
ought
to
do
then
it
will
be
my
business
yes
my
business
im
a
father
in
the
month
and
a
half
since
anna
pavlovnas
soir233e
followed
by
the
sleepless
agitated
night
in
which
he
decided
that
marriage
to
h233l232ne
would
be
a
misfortune
and
that
he
must
avoid
her
and
go
away
pierre
after
this
decision
did
not
move
out
of
prince
vassilys
house
and
felt
with
horror
that
in
peoples
eyes
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
bound
to
her
every
day
that
he
simply
could
not
go
back
to
his
former
view
of
her
nor
could
he
tear
himself
away
from
her
that
it
would
be
terrible
but
that
he
would
have
to
bind
his
fate
to
hers
he
might
perhaps
have
refrained
but
not
a
day
passed
without
prince
vassily
who
rarely
held
receptions
having
a
soir233e
at
which
pierre
had
to
be
present
if
he
did
not
want
to
spoil
the
general
pleasure
and
disappoint
everyones
expectations
prince
vassily
in
those
rare
moments
when
he
was
at
home
would
pass
by
pierre
pull
his
hand
downwards
distractedly
offer
him
his
cleanshaven
wrinkled
cheek
to
kiss
and
say
either
see
you
tomorrow
or
at
dinner
otherwise
i
wont
see
you
or
im
staying
for
your
sake
and
so
on
but
despite
the
fact
that
when
prince
vassily
stayed
for
pierres
sake
as
he
put
it
he
did
not
say
two
words
to
him
pierre
did
not
feel
himself
capable
of
disappointing
his
expectations
every
day
he
said
one
and
the
same
thing
to
himself
i
must
finally
understand
her
and
find
out
for
myself
who
she
is
was
i
mistaken
before
or
am
i
mistaken
now
no
shes
not
stupid
no
shes
a
wonderful
girl
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
shes
never
mistaken
in
anything
she
never
says
anything
stupid
she
speaks
little
but
what
she
says
is
always
simple
and
clear
so
shes
not
stupid
shes
never
been
embarrassed
and
is
not
embarrassed
now
so
shes
not
a
bad
woman
it
often
happened
when
he
was
with
her
that
he
would
begin
to
argue
to
think
aloud
and
she
responded
to
that
each
time
either
by
a
brief
but
appropriate
remark
showing
that
it
did
not
interest
her
or
by
a
silent
smile
and
glance
which
showed
pierre
her
superiority
most
palpably
she
was
right
in
considering
all
arguments
as
nonsense
compared
with
that
smile
she
always
addressed
him
with
a
joyful
trusting
smile
meant
for
him
alone
in
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
what
was
in
the
general
smile
that
always
adorned
her
face
pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
only
waiting
for
him
finally
to
say
one
word
to
cross
a
certain
line
and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
cross
it
but
some
incomprehensible
terror
seized
him
at
the
mere
thought
of
that
frightful
step
a
thousand
times
in
the
course
of
that
month
and
a
half
all
the
while
feeling
himself
drawn
more
and
more
into
that
frightening
abyss
pierre
had
said
to
himself
but
what
is
it
i
need
resolve
dont
i
have
any
he
wanted
to
resolve
it
but
felt
with
terror
that
in
this
case
he
lacked
the
resolve
that
he
knew
he
had
and
that
indeed
was
in
him
pierre
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
strong
only
when
they
feel
themselves
perfectly
pure
and
since
the
day
when
he
had
been
possessed
by
that
feeling
of
desire
which
he
had
experienced
over
the
snuffbox
at
anna
pavlovnas
an
unconscious
feeling
of
guilt
on
account
of
that
attraction
had
paralyzed
his
resolve
on

a
small
company
of

and

as

all
these

feeling
that

was
to
be
decided
that

the

were
sitting
over

princess

a
massive

at
the
end
of

sat
the
less
old
and
honored
guests
and
there
also
as
the
household
sat
pierre
and
h233l232nenext
to
each
other
prince
vassily
did
not
eat
he
strolled
around
the
table
in
a
merry
state
of
mind
sitting
down
now
with
one
now
with
another
of
the
guests
to
each
he
spoke
a
casual
and
agreeable
word
except
for
pierre
and
h233l232ne
whose
presence
he
seemed
not
to
notice
prince
vassily
enlivened
everyone
the
wax
candles
burned
brightly
the
silver
and
crystal
the
ladies
gowns
and
the
gold
and
silver
epaulettes
shone
servants
in
red
kaftans
scurried
around
the
table
the
sounds
of
knives
glasses
plates
were
heard
and
the
sounds
of
animated
talk
in
several
conversations
around
that
table
an
old
chamberlain
was
heard
at
one
end
assuring
a
little
old
baroness
of
his
ardent
love
for
her
and
so
too
was
her
laughter
at
the
other
end
the
story
of
the
unsuccess
of
some
marya
viktorovna
at
the
middle
of
the
table
prince
vassily
concentrated
listeners
around
himself
he
was
telling
the
ladies
with
a
jocular
smile
on
his
lips
about
the
latest
sessionon
wednesdayof
the
state
council
at
which
sergei
kuzmich
vyazmitinov
the
new
military
governor
general
of
petersburg
had
received
and
read
the
thenfamous
rescript
of
the
sovereign
alexander
pavlovich
from
the
army
in
which
the
sovereign
addressing
sergei
kuzmich
said
that
he
had
received
declarations
of
the
peoples
devotion
from
all
sides
and
that
the
declaration
from
petersburg
was
especially
pleasing
to
him
that
he
was
proud
of
the
honor
of
being
the
head
of
such
a
nation
and
would
try
to
prove
worthy
of
it
the
rescript
began
with
the
words
sergei
kuzmich
from
all
sides
rumors
reach
me
and
so
on
so
it
never
went
further
than
sergei
kuzmich
one
lady
asked
no
no
not
a
hairs
breadth
prince
vassily
replied
laughing
sergei
kuzmichfrom
all
sides
from
all
sides
sergei
kuzmich
poor
vyazmitinov
just
couldnt
get
any
further
he
took
up
the
letter
several
more
times
but
as
soon
as
he
said
sergeisobskuzmichtearsand
from
all
sides
was
drowned
in
weeping
and
he
couldnt
go
on
and
again
his
handkerchief
and
again
sergei
kuzmich
from
all
sides
and
tearsso
that
they
finally
asked
someone
else
to
read
it
kuzmichfrom
all
sides
and
tears
someone
repeated
laughing
dont
be
wicked
anna
pavlovna
said
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
shaking
her
finger
cest
un
si
brave
et
excellent
homme
notre
bon
viasmitinoff
everyone
laughed
a
lot
at
the
upper
honored
end
of
the
table
everyone
seemed
to
be
merry
and
under
the
influence
of
the
most
varied
lively
moods
only
pierre
and
h233l232ne
silently
sat
next
to
each
other
almost
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
table
on
both
their
faces
there
was
a
restrained
radiant
smile
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
sergei
kuzmicha
smile
of
bashfulness
about
their
own
feelings
whatever
the
others
said
however
they
laughed
and
joked
together
whatever
the
appetite
with
which
they
savored
the
rhein
wine
the
saut233
the
ice
cream
however
they
avoided
glancing
at
this
couple
however
indifferent
or
inattentive
to
them
they
seemed
the
feeling
for
some
reason
was
from
the
occasional
glances
cast
at
them
that
the
anecdote
about
sergei
kuzmich
and
the
laughter
and
the
food
were
all
a
pretense
and
all
the
power
of
attention
of
the
entire
company
was
directed
only
at
this
couplepierre
and
h233l232ne
prince
vassily
imitated
sergei
kuzmichs
sobbing
and
at
the
same
time
shot
a
glance
at
his
daughter
and
all
the
while
he
laughed
the
expression
on
his
face
said
yes
yes
its
all
going
well
tonight
it
will
all
be
decided
anna
pavlovna
shook
her
finger
at
him
for
notre
bon
viasmitinoff
but
in
her
eyes
which
flashed
momentarily
at
pierre
prince
vassily
read
congratulations
on
his
future
soninlaw
and
his
daughters
happiness
the
old
princess
offering
wine
with
a
sad
sigh
to
the
lady
next
to
her
and
glancing
angrily
at
her
daughter
seemed
to
be
saying
with
that
sigh
yes
now
you
and
i
have
nothing
left
but
to
drink
sweet
wine
my
dear
now
its
time
for
these
young
ones
to
be
so
boldly
and
defiantly
happy
and
what
stupidity
all
this
that
im
going
on
about
is
as
if
it
interests
me
thought
the
diplomat
glancing
at
the
happy
faces
of
the
lovers
that
is
happiness
amidst
the
insignificant
trifles
the
artificial
interests
that
bound
this
company
together
there
turned
up
the
simple
feeling
of
attraction
of
a
handsome
and
healthy
young
man
and
woman
for
each
other
and
this
human
feeling
overwhelmed
everything
and
soared
above
all
this
artifical
babble
the
jokes
were
not
funny
the
news
was
not
interesting
the
animation
was
obviously
feigned
not
only
they
but
the
footmen
serving
at
the
table
seemed
to
feel
the
same
and
forgot
the
order
of
the
service
gazing
at
the
beauty
h233l232ne
with
her
radiant
face
and
at
the
red
fat
happy
and
uneasy
face
of
pierre
it
seemed
that
even
the
light
of
the
candles
was
concentrated
only
on
those
two
happy
faces
pierre
felt
that
he
was
the
center
of
everything
and
this
position
delighted
and
embarrassed
him
he
found
himself
in
the
state
of
a
man
immersed
in
some
occupation
he
neither
saw
nor
understood
nor
heard
anything
clearly
only
rarely
unexpectedly
did
fragmentary
thoughts
and
impressions
of
reality
flash
in
his
soul
so
its
all
over
he
thought
and
how
did
it
all
happen
so
quickly
now
i
know
that
not
for
her
alone
not
for
me
alone
but
for
all
of
them
this
inevitably
had
to
come
about
they
all
expect
this
so
much
theyre
so
certain
it
will
be
that
i
simply
cannot
disappoint
them
but
how
will
it
be
i
dont
know
but
it
will
be
it
will
be
without
fail
thought
pierre
glancing
at
those
shoulders
gleaming
just
near
his
eyes
then
he
suddenly
became
ashamed
of
something
he
felt
embarrassed
that
he
alone
was
taking
up
everyones
attention
that
he
was
a
lucky
fellow
in
the
eyes
of
othershe
with
his
unattractive
face
some
sort
of
paris
taking
possession
of
helen
but
surely
it
always
happens
that
way
and
must
be
so
he
comforted
himself
and
anyhow
what
did
i
do
for
it
when
did
it
begin
i
left
moscow
along
with
prince
vassily
there
wasnt
anything
yet
and
then
why
shouldnt
i
have
stayed
with
him
then
i
played
cards
with
her
picked
up
her
reticule
went
for
a
ride
with
her
when
did
it
begin
when
did
it
all
happen
and
here
he
is
sitting
next
to
her
a
fianc233
he
hears
sees
feels
her
closeness
her
breathing
her
movements
her
beauty
now
it
suddenly
seems
to
him
that
it
is
not
she
but
he
himself
who
is
so
extraordinarily
beautiful
that
that
is
why
they
are
looking
at
him
that
way
and
he
happy
in
the
general
astonishment
draws
himself
up
raises
his
head
and
rejoices
at
his
happiness
suddenly
some
voice
someones
familiar
voice
is
heard
and
says
something
to
him
yet
again
but
pierre
is
so
taken
up
that
he
does
not
understand
what
is
said
to
him
im
asking
you
when
you
got
a
letter
from
bolkonsky
prince
vassily
repeats
for
the
third
time
youre
so
distracted
my
dear
prince
vassily
smiles
and
pierre
sees
that
everyone
everyone
is
smiling
at
him
and
at
h233l232ne
well
so
what
if
you
all
know
pierre
says
to
himself
well
so
what
its
true
and
he
smiles
his
meek
childlike
smile
and
h233l232ne
smiles
too
when
did
you
get
it
from
olm252tz
prince
vassily
repeats
as
if
he
needs
to
know
in
order
to
settle
an
argument
can
one
really
speak
and
think
about
such
trifles
thinks
pierre
yes
from
olm252tz
he
answers
with
a
sigh
after
supper
pierre
led
his
lady
after
the
others
to
the
drawing
room
the
guests
began
to
depart
and
some
left
without
saying
goodbye
to
h233l232ne
as
if
not
wishing
to
tear
her
away
from
her
serious
occupation
some
approached
for
a
moment
and
left
quickly
forbidding
her
to
see
them
off
the
diplomat
was
sadly
silent
as
he
left
the
drawing
room
he
was
thinking
about
all
the
vanity
of
his
diplomatic
career
compared
with
pierres
happiness
the
old
general
grumbled
angrily
at
his
wife
when
she
asked
him
how
his
foot
was
ah
you
old
fool
he
thought
elena
sergeevna
now
shell
be
the
same
beauty
even
when
shes
fifty
it
seems
i
can
congratulate
you
anna
pavlovna
whispered
to
the
princess
and
kissed
her
warmly
if
it
werent
for
my
migraine
i
would
have
stayed
the
princess
said
nothing
in
reply
she
was
tormented
by
envy
of
her
daughters
happiness
while
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
pierre
remained
alone
with
h233l232ne
for
a
long
time
in
the
small
drawing
room
where
they
were
sitting
often
before
during
the
last
month
and
a
half
he
had
remained
alone
with
h233l232ne
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love
now
he
felt
that
this
was
necessary
but
he
simply
could
not
resolve
upon
this
last
step
he
was
ashamed
it
seemed
to
him
that
here
beside
h233l232ne
he
was
occupying
someone
elses
place
this
happiness
is
not
for
you
some
inner
voice
was
telling
him
this
happiness
is
for
those
who
do
not
have
what
you
have
but
he
had
to
say
something
and
so
he
began
to
speak
he
asked
her
whether
she
was
pleased
with
tonights
soir233e
she
answered
with
her
usual
simplicity
that
this
name
day
had
been
one
of
the
most
pleasant
for
her
some
of
the
nearest
relations
were
still
there
they
were
sitting
in
the
big
drawing
room
prince
vassily
walked
lazily
over
to
pierre
pierre
stood
up
and
said
it
was
already
late
prince
vassily
gave
him
a
sternly
questioning
look
as
if
what
he
had
said
was
so
strange
that
he
could
not
even
hear
it
well
but
then
the
expression
of
sternness
changed
and
prince
vassily
pulled
pierres
arm
down
seated
him
and
smiled
gently
well
lelya
he
at
once
addressed
his
daughter
in
that
careless
tone
of
habitual
tenderness
which
is
adopted
by
parents
who
have
been
affectionate
with
their
children
since
childhood
but
which
prince
vassily
only
approximated
by
means
of
imitating
other
parents
and
again
he
turned
to
pierre
sergei
kuzmich
from
all
sides
he
said
undoing
the
top
button
of
his
waistcoat
pierre
smiled
but
it
was
clear
from
his
smile
that
he
realized
it
was
not
the
anecdote
about
sergei
kuzmich
that
interested
prince
vassily
just
then
and
prince
vassily
realized
that
pierre
realized
it
prince
vassily
suddenly
burbled
something
and
left
to
pierre
it
looked
as
if
even
prince
vassily
was
embarrassed
the
sight
of
this
worldly
old
mans
embarrassment
touched
pierre
he
glanced
at
h233l232neshe
too
seemed
embarrassed
and
her
glance
said
well
its
your
own
fault
i
must
inevitably
cross
it
but
i
cant
i
cant
thought
pierre
and
again
he
began
talking
about
unrelated
things
about
sergei
kuzmich
asking
what
the
anecdote
was
because
he
had
not
heard
it
well
h233l232ne
replied
with
a
smile
that
she
did
not
know
either
when
prince
vassily
came
into
the
drawing
room
the
princess
was
talking
softly
with
an
elderly
lady
about
pierre
of
course
cest
un
parti
tr232s
brilliant
mais
le
bonheur
ma
ch232re
les
marriages
se
font
dans
les
cieux
the
elderly
lady
replied
prince
vassily
as
if
not
listening
to
the
ladies
went
to
the
far
corner
and
sat
on
the
sofa
he
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
dozing
his
head
began
to
nod
and
he
woke
up
aline
he
said
to
his
wife
allez
voir
ce
quils
font
the
princess
went
to
the
door
passed
by
it
with
a
significant
indifferent
look
and
peeked
into
the
drawing
room
pierre
and
h233l232ne
were
sitting
and
talking
in
the
same
way
all
the
same
she
said
to
her
husband
prince
vassily
frowned
his
mouth
twisted
to
one
side
his
cheeks
twitched
with
an
unpleasant
coarse
expression
peculiar
to
him
he
roused
himself
got
up
threw
his
head
back
and
with
a
resolute
stride
walked
past
the
ladies
into
the
small
drawing
room
he
strode
quickly
joyfully
up
to
pierre
the
princes
expression
was
so
extraordinarily
joyful
that
pierre
stood
up
frightened
when
he
saw
him
thank
god
he
said
my
wife
has
told
me
everything
he
embraced
pierre
with
one
arm
his
daughter
with
the
other
lelya
my
friend
im
very
very
glad
his
voice
quavered
i
loved
your
fatherand
she
will
be
a
good
wife
to
yougod
bless
you
he
embraced
his
daughter
then
pierre
again
and
kissed
him
with
his
old
mans
mouth
tears
actually
wet
his
cheeks
princess
come
here
he
called
the
princess
came
in
and
also
wept
the
elderly
lady
also
dabbed
herself
with
her
handkerchief
they
kissed
pierre
and
he
kissed
the
beautiful
h233l232nes
hand
several
times
after
a
while
they
were
left
alone
again
all
this
had
to
be
so
and
could
not
be
otherwise
thought
pierre
therefore
theres
no
point
in
asking
whether
its
good
or
bad
its
good
because
its
definite
and
theres
no
more
of
the
old
tormenting
doubt
pierre
silently
held
his
fianc233es
hand
and
looked
at
her
beautiful
breast
rising
and
falling
h233l232ne
he
said
aloud
and
stopped
something
special
is
said
on
these
occasions
he
thought
but
he
simply
could
not
remember
precisely
what
was
said
on
these
occasions
he
looked
at
her
face
she
moved
closer
to
him
her
face
blushed
oh
take
off
thosewhatever
theyre
she
was
pointing
to
his
spectacles
pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
and
his
eyes
on
top
of
the
general
strangeness
of
peoples
eyes
when
they
take
off
their
spectacles
had
a
frightened
and
questioning
look
he
was
about
to
bend
down
to
her
hand
and
kiss
it
but
she
with
a
quick
and
crude
movement
of
her
head
intercepted
his
lips
and
brought
them
together
with
her
own
her
face
struck
pierre
by
its
altered
unpleasantly
perplexed
expression
its
too
late
now
its
all
over
and
anyway
i
love
her
thought
pierre
je
vous
aime
he
said
having
remembered
what
needed
to
be
said
on
these
occasions
but
the
words
sounded
so
meager
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
a
month
and
a
half
later
he
was
married
and
settled
down
as
they
say
the
happy
possessor
of
a
beautiful
wife
and
millions
of
roubles
in
the
big
newly
doneover
house
of

themselves
the
little
princess
said
indiscreetly
on
hearing
of
it
prince
nikolai
andreich
winced
and
said
nothing
two
weeks
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
in
the
evening
prince
vassilys
people
arrived
in
advance
of
him
and
the
next
day
he
himself
arrived
with
his
son
old
bolkonsky
had
always
had
a
rather
low
opinion
of
prince
vassilys
character
and
the
more
so
in
recent
times
when
prince
vassily
under
the
new
reigns
of
paul
and
alexander
had
gone
far
in
rank
and
honors
now
from
the
hints
in
the
letter
and
from
the
little
princess
he
understood
what
the
matter
was
and
the
low
opinion
of
prince
vassily
in
prince
nikolai
andreichs
soul
turned
into
a
feeling
of
hostile
disdain
he
snorted
constantly
when
he
spoke
of
him
on
the
day
of
prince
vassilys
arrival
prince
nikolai
andreich
was
especially
displeased
and
illhumored
whether
he
was
illhumored
because
prince
vassily
was
coming
or
he
was
especially
displeased
with
prince
vassilys
coming
because
he
was
illhumored
in
any
case
he
was
illhumored
and
already
in
the
morning
tikhon
had
advised
the
architect
against
going
to
the
prince
with
a
report
do
you
hear
how
his
honor
is
walking
tikhon
said
drawing
the
architects
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
princes
footsteps
stepping
full
on
his
heelswe
know
about
that
however
as
usual
after
eight
oclock
the
prince
went
out
for
a
walk
in
his
velvet
coat
with
the
sable
collar
and
matching
hat
it
had
snowed
the
day
before
the
path
on
which
prince
nikolai
andreich
always
walked
to
the
conservatory
had
been
cleared
the
traces
of
the
broom
could
be
seen
on
the
swept
snow
and
a
shovel
was
stuck
in
one
of
the
loosely
heapedup
snowbanks
that
lined
both
sides
of
the
path
the
prince
walked
through
the
conservatory
the
servants
quarters
and
outbuildings
frowning
and
silent
but
can
one
get
through
in
a
sleigh
he
asked
the
steward
who
accompanied
him
back
to
the
house
a
respectable
man
in
face
and
manner
resembling
his
master
the
snow
is
deep
your
excellency
ive
already
ordered
it
cleared
on
the
avenue
the
prince
inclined
his
head
and
went
up
to
the
porch
thank
god
thought
the
steward
the
cloud
has
passed
it
would
have
been
hard
to
get
through
your
excellency
the
steward
added
so
weve
heard
your
excellency
that
a
minister
is
going
to
be
visiting
your
excellency
the
prince
turned
to
the
steward
and
fixed
him
with
a
frowning
gaze
what
a
minister
what
minister
who
ordered
it
he
began
speaking
in
his
piercingly
harsh
voice
you
didnt
clear
it
for
the
princess
my
daughter
but
for
a
minister
i
have
no
ministers
your
excellency
i
assumed
you
assumed
cried
the
prince
articulating
the
words
still
more
hastily
and
incoherently
you
assumedbrigands
knavesill
teach
you
to
assume
and
raising
his
stick
he
swung
it
at
alpatych
and
would
have
hit
him
if
the
steward
had
not
instinctively
avoided
the
blow
assumedknaves
he
shouted
hurriedly
but
even
though
alpatych
frightened
by
his
own
boldness
in
avoiding
the
blow
approached
the
prince
with
his
bald
head
obediently
bowed
or
perhaps
precisely
because
of
it
the
prince
while
shouting
knavescover
the
roaddid
not
raise
his
stick
again
and
ran
inside
before
dinner
the
young
princess
and
mlle
bourienne
knowing
that
the
prince
was
illhumored
stood
waiting
for
him
mlle
bourienne
with
a
beaming
face
which
said
i
know
nothing
im
the
same
as
ever
and
princess
marya
pale
frightened
with
lowered
eyes
the
hardest
thing
of
all
for
princess
marya
was
that
she
knew
that
on
these
occasions
she
ought
to
behave
like
mlle
bourienne
but
could
not
do
it
she
imagined
if
i
make
as
if
i
dont
notice
hell
think
i
have
no
compassion
for
him
if
i
make
as
if
i
myself
am
dull
and
illhumored
hell
say
as
has
happened
that
im
moping
and
so
on
the
prince
looked
at
his
daughters
frightened
face
and
snorted
traor
a
dimwit
he
said
and
the
other
ones
not
here
theyve
already
spread
the
gossip
he
thought
about
the
little
princess
who
was
not
in
the
dining
room
and
where
is
the
princess
he
asked
hiding
shes
not
quite
well
mlle
bourienne
replied
with
a
cheerful
smile
she
wont
be
coming
out
its
so
understandable
in
her
condition
hem
hem
huff
huff
said
the
prince
and
sat
down
at
the
table
his
plate
did
not
seem
clean
to
him
he
pointed
to
a
spot
and
flung
it
aside
tikhon
caught
it
and
handed
it
to
the
butler
the
little
princess
was
not
unwell
but
her
fear
of
the
prince
was
so
insuperable
that
on
learning
that
he
was
illhumored
she
decided
not
to
come
out
im
afraid
for
the
baby
she
said
to
mlle
bourienne
god
knows
what
fright
may
do
in
general
the
little
princess
lived
at
bald
hills
under
a
constant
feeling
of
fear
and
antipathy
for
the
old
prince
though
she
was
not
aware
of
the
antipathy
because
the
fear
was
so
predominant
that
she
could
not
feel
it
on
the
princes
side
there
was
also
antipathy
but
it
was
smothered
by
contempt
the
princess
having
made
herself
at
home
at
bald
hills
had
especially
grown
to
love
mlle
bourienne
spent
whole
days
with
her
invited
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
and
often
talked
with
her
about
her
fatherinlaw
criticizing
him
il
nous
arrive
du
monde
mon
prince
said
mlle
bourienne
unfolding
a
white
napkin
with
her
pink
little
hands
son

ce

she
said
questioningly
hm
this
excellence
is
a
little
brati
solicited
his
post
for
him
in
the
ministry
the
prince
said
peevishly
and
why
the
son
i
cannot
comprehend
princess
lizaveta
karlovna
and
princess
marya
may
know
but
i
dont
know
why
theyre
bringing
this
son
here
i
have
no
need
of
him
and
he
looked
at
his
blushing
daughter
unwell
are
you
afraid
of
the
minister
as
that
blockhead
alpatych
said
today
no
mon
p232re
unfortunate
as
mlle
bouriennes
choice
of
subject
had
been
she
did
not
stop
and
babbled
about
the
conservatory
about
the
beauty
of
a
newly
opened
flower
and
after
the
soup
the
prince
relented
after
dinner
he
went
to
see
his
daughterinlaw
the
little
princess
was
sitting
at
a
small
table
chatting
with
the
maid
masha
she
turned
pale
when
she
saw
her
fatherinlaw
the
little
princess
was
much
changed
she
was
rather
more
bad
than
goodlooking
now
her
cheeks
sagged
her
lip
rose
up
her
eyes
were
drawn
down
yes
a
sort
of
heaviness
she
replied
to
the
princes
question
of
how
she
felt
do
you
need
anything
no
merci
mon
p232re
well
all
right
all
right
he
left
and
went
to
the
servants
room
alpatych
his
head
bowed
was
standing
in
the
servants
room
has
the
road
been
covered
it
has
your
excellency
forgive
me
for
gods
sake
it
was
only
my
stupidity
the
prince
cut
him
short
and
laughed
his
unnatural
laugh
well
all
right
all
right
he
offered
his
hand
for
alpatych
to
kiss
and
went
to
his
study
in
the
evening
prince
vassily
arrived
he
was
met
on
the
avenue
as
they
called
the
front
drive
by
the
coachmen
and
servants
who
with
shouts
dragged
his
carts
and
sleigh
to
the
wing
over
the
road
that
had
been
deliberately
covered
with
snow
prince
vassily
and
anatole
were
given
separate
rooms
anatole
having
taken
off
his
tunic
sat
with
arms
akimbo
before
a
table
at
a
corner
of
which
smiling
he
directed
fixedly
and
distractedly
his
beautiful
big
eyes
he
looked
upon
his
whole
life
as
a
ceaseless
entertainment
which
somebody
for
some
reason
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
arrange
for
him
now
too
he
looked
in
this
way
upon
his
journey
to
the
wicked
old
man
and
the
rich
ugly
heiress
all
this
as
he
supposed
might
turn
out
very
nice
and
amusing
and
why
shouldnt
i
marry
her
if
shes
very
rich
that
never
hurts
thought
anatole
he
shaved
scented
himself
with
a
thoroughness
and
foppishness
that
had
become
habitual
to
him
and
with
his
innately
goodhumored
and
triumphant
expression
carrying
his
handsome
head
high
went
into
his
fathers
room
two
valets
were
bustling
around
prince
vassily
dressing
him
he
himself
looked
around
animatedly
and
nodded
cheerfully
to
his
entering
son
as
if
to
say
right
thats
how
i
need
you
to
look
no
without
joking
father
is
she
very
ugly
eh
he
asked
in
french
as
if
continuing
a
conversation
they
had
had
more
than
once
during
the
journey
enough
nonsense
above
all
try
to
be
respectful
and
sensible
with
the
old
prince
if
he
starts
being
abusive
ill
leave
said
anatole
i
cant
stand
these
old
men
eh
remember
for
you
everything
depends
on
this
by
that
time
in
the
maids
quarters
not
only
was
everything
known
about
the
arrival
of
the
minister
and
his
son
but
their
external
appearance
had
already
been
described
in
detail
princess
marya
sat
alone
in
her
room
vainly
trying
to
overcome
her
inner
excitement
why
did
they
write
why
did
liza
tell
me
about
it
all
it
just
cant
be
she
kept
saying
to
herself
looking
in
the
mirror
how
will
i
come
out
to
the
drawing
room
even
if
i
liked
him
i
couldnt
be
myself
with
him
now
the
mere
thought
of
her
fathers
gaze
terrified
her
the
little
princess
and
mlle
bourienne
had
already
received
all
the
necessary
information
from
the
maid
masha
about
what
a
ruddy
darkbrowed
handsome
fellow
the
ministers
son
was
and
how
his
papa
could
barely
drag
his
feet
up
the
stairs
while
he
like
an
eagle
ran
up
after
him
taking
three
steps
at
a
time
on
receiving
this
information
the
little
princess
and
mlle
bourienne
their
animatedly
chattering
voices
heard
already
from
the
corridor
came
into
princess
maryas
room
ils
sont
arriv233s
marie
do
you
know
said
the
little
princess
waddling
in
with
her
belly
and
lowering
herself
heavily
into
an
armchair
she
was
no
longer
in
the
smock
she
had
on
that
morning
but
was
wearing
one
of
her
best
gowns
her
hair
was
carefully
done
and
in
her
face
there
was
animation
which
however
did
not
conceal
the
sagging
and
deadened
contours
of
her
face
in
a
costume
she
used
to
wear
in
petersburg
society
it
was
still
more
noticeable
how
far
she
had
lost
her
good
looks
mlle
bouriennes
costume
had
also
undergone
some
sort
of
inconspicuous
improvement
which
made
her
fresh
pretty
face
still
more
attractive
et
bien
et
vous
restez
comme
vous
234tes
ch232re
princesse
she
said
on
va
venir
annoncer
que
ces
messieurs
sont
au
salon
il
faudra
descendre
et
vous
ne
faites
pas
un
petit
brin
de
toilette
the
little
princess
got
up
from
the
armchair
rang
for
the
maid
and
began
hurriedly
and
cheerfully
devising
a
costume
for
princess
marya
and
carrying
it
out
princess
marya
felt
insulted
in
her
sense
of
her
own
dignity
because
the
arrival
of
the
promised
suitor
excited
her
and
she
was
still
more
insulted
that
her
two
friends
did
not
suppose
it
could
be
otherwise
to
tell
them
how
ashamed
she
was
of
herself
and
of
them
would
mean
to
betray
her
excitement
besides
to
refuse
the
dressingup
they
suggested
would
lead
to
prolonged
bantering
and
insistence
she
flushed
her
beautiful
eyes
faded
her
face
became
covered
with
blotches
and
with
that
unattractive
expression
of
a
victim
which
most
often
lingered
on
her
face
she
gave
herself
into
the
power
of
mlle
bourienne
and
liza
the
two
women
concerned
themselves
in
all
sincerity
with
making
her
beautiful
she
was
so
plain
that
the
thought
of
rivalry
with
her
did
not
occur
to
either
of
them
they
therefore
undertook
to
dress
her
up
in
all
sincerity
with
that
na239ve
and
firm
conviction
of
women
that
clothes
can
make
a
face
beautiful
no
really
ma
bonne
amie
this
dress
wont
do
liza
said
looking
sideways
at
the
princess
from
a
distance
have
them
bring
the
maroon
one
youve
got
there
really
why
this
may
just
be
the
deciding
of
your
fate
in
life
and
this
is
too
light
it
wont
do
no
it
wont
do
what
would
not
do
was
not
the
dress
but
the
face
and
the
whole
figure
of
the
princess
but
neither
mlle
bourienne
nor
the
little
princess
sensed
that
it
seemed
to
them
that
if
a
blue
ribbon
was
put
in
the
hair
done
up
high
and
a
blue
scarf
hung
down
on
the
brown
dress
and
so
on
all
would
be
well
they
forgot
that
the
frightened
face
and
figure
could
not
be
changed
and
therefore
no
matter
how
they
changed
the
frame
and
decoration
of
that
face
the
face
itself
remained
pitiful
and
unattractive
after
two
or
three
changes
to
which
princess
marya
submitted
obediently
when
her
hair
had
been
done
up
high
a
style
that
totally
changed
and
spoiled
her
face
and
she
was
wearing
the
blue
scarf
and
fancy
maroon
gown
the
little
princess
walked
around
her
twice
straightened
a
fold
here
pulled
at
the
scarf
there
with
her
little
hand
and
inclining
her
head
looked
now
from
this
side
now
from
that
no
its
impossible
she
said
resolutely
clasping
her
hands
non

she
said
to
the
maid
bring
the
princess
her
little
gray
dress
and
watch
mlle
bourienne
how
im
going
to
arrange
it
she
said
with
a
smiling
foretaste
of
artistic
delight
but
when
katya
brought
the
dress
requested
princess
marya
was
still
sitting
motionless
before
the
mirror
looking
at
her
face
and
saw
in
the
mirror
that
tears
had
welled
up
in
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
was
trembling
getting
ready
to
weep
voyons

said
mlle

encore
un

effort
the
little
princess
taking
the
dress
from
the
maids
hands
was
approaching
princess
marya
no
now
well
make
it
simple
and
sweet
she
said
her
voice
mlle
bouriennes
and
katyas
who
was
laughing
about
something
blended
into
a
merry
warbling
which
resembled
the
song
of
birds
non
laissezmoi
said
the
princess
and
there
was
so
much
seriousness
and
suffering
in
her
voice
that
the
birds
warbling
immediately
ceased
they
looked
at
her
big
beautiful
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thought
looking
at
them
clearly
and
pleadingly
and
understood
that
to
insist
would
be
useless
and
even
cruel
au

said
the
little
princess

said
with
reproach
turning
to

answered
a
voice
barely
holding
back
its
tears
mlle
bourienne
and
the
little
princess
had
to
confess
to
themselves
that
as
she
was
princess
marya
looked
very
bad
worse
than
ever
but
it
was
already
late
she
looked
at
them
with
that
expression
they
knew
an
expression
of
thought
and
sadness
this
expression
did
not
inspire
any
fear
of
princess
marya
in
them
she
never
inspired
that
feeling
in
anyone
but
they
knew
that
when
that
expression
appeared
on
her
face
she
became
silent
and
unshakeable
in
her
decisions
vous

said
liza
and
when
princess
marya
made
no
reply
liza
left
the
room
princess
marya
remained
alone
she
did
not
carry
out
lizas
wish
and
not
only
did
not
change
her
hairstyle
but
did
not
even
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
strengthlessly
lowering
her
eyes
and
arms
she
sat
silently
and
thought
she
imagined
a
husband
a
man
a
strong
dominating
and
incomprehensibly
attractive
being
suddenly
carrying
her
off
into
his
own
completely
different
happy
world
her
own
baby
like
the
one
she
had
seen
yesterday
at
her
nurses
daughtersshe
imagined
at
her
own
breast
the
husband
stands
and
looks
tenderly
at
her
and
the
baby
but
no
its
impossible
im
too
plain
she
thought
please
come
to
tea
the
prince
will
come
out
shortly
said
the
maids
voice
outside
the
door
she
roused
herself
and
was
horrified
at
what
she
had
been
thinking
and
before
going
downstairs
she
stood
up
went
to
her
icon
room
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
dark
lamplit
face
of
a
large
icon
of
the
savior
stood
before
it
with
clasped
hands
for
several
minutes
there
was
tormenting
doubt
in
princess
maryas
soul
was
the
joy
of
love
of
earthly
love
for
a
man
possible
for
her
thinking
of
marriage
princess
marya
dreamed
of
family
happiness
and
children
but
her
chiefest
strongest
and
most
secret
dream
was
of
earthly
love
this
feeling
was
all
the
stronger
the
more
she
tried
to
conceal
it
from
others
and
even
from
herself
my
god
she
said
how
can
i
suppress
these
devils
thoughts
in
my
heart
how
can
i
renounce
evil
imaginings
forever
so
as
peacefully
to
do
thy
will
and
she
had
barely
asked
this
question
when
god
answered
her
in
her
own
heart
desire
nothing
for
yourself
do
not
seek
do
not
worry
do
not
envy
the
future
of
people
and
your
own
fate
must
be
unknown
to
you
but
live
so
as
to
be
ready
for
anything
if
god
should
see
fit
to
test
you
in
the
duties
of
marriage
be
ready
to
fulfill
his
will
with
this
reassuring
thought
but
still
with
a
hope
that
her
forbidden
earthly
dream
would
be
fulfilled
princess
marya
sighed
crossed
herself
and
went
downstairs
without
thinking
about
her
dress
or
her
hairstyle
or
how
she
would
walk
in
or
what
she
would
say
what
could
all
that
mean
in
comparison
with
the
predestination
of
god
without
whose
will
not
one
hair
falls
from
mans
head
iv
when
princess
marya
came
in
prince
vassily
and
his
son
were
already
in
the
drawing
room
talking
with
the
little
princess
and
mlle
bourienne
when
she
came
in
with
her
heavy
step
planting
her
heels
the
men
and
mlle
bourienne
rose
and
the
little
princess
pointing
to
her
said
voil224
marie
princess
marya
saw
them
all
and
saw
them
in
detail
she
saw
the
face
of
prince
vassily
momentarily
freezing
in
a
serious
expression
at
the
sight
of
the
princess
and
the
face
of
the
little
princess
curiously
reading
on
the
faces
of
the
guests
the
impression
marie
made
she
also
saw
mlle
bourienne
with
her
ribbon
and
her
beautiful
face
and
her
gazelively
as
never
beforedirected
at
him
but
she
could
not
see
him
she
saw
only
something
big
bright
and
beautiful
which
moved
towards
her
as
she
came
into
the
room
prince
vassily
went
up
to
her
first
and
she
kissed
the
bald
head
that
bowed
over
her
hand
and
to
his
words
replied
that
on
the
contrary
she
remembered
him
very
well
then
anatole
came
up
to
her
she
still
did
not
see
him
she
only
felt
a
gentle
hand
firmly
take
hold
of
her
hand
and
barely
touched
the
white
forehead
with
beautiful
pomaded
blond
hair
above
it
when
she
looked
at
him
his
beauty
struck
her
anatole
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
placed
behind
a
fastened
button
of
his
uniform
chest
thrust
out
shoulders
back
swinging
his
free
leg
slightly
and
inclining
his
head
a
little
gazed
silently
and
cheerfully
at
the
princess
obviously
without
thinking
of
her
at
all
anatole
was
not
resourceful
not
quick
and
eloquent
in
conversation
but
he
had
instead
a
capacity
precious
in
society
for
composure
and
unalterable
assurance
when
an
insecure
man
is
silent
at
first
acquaintance
and
shows
an
awareness
of
the
impropriety
of
this
silence
and
a
wish
to
find
something
to
say
it
comes
out
badly
but
anatole
was
silent
swung
his
leg
and
cheerfully
observed
the
princesss
hairstyle
it
was
clear
that
he
could
calmly
remain
silent
like
that
for
a
very
long
time
if
anyone
feels
awkward
because
of
this
silence
speak
up
but
i
dont
care
to
his
look
seemed
to
say
besides
that
in
anatoles
behavior
with
women
there
was
a
manner
which
more
than
any
other
awakens
womens
curiosity
fear
and
even
lovea
manner
of
contemptuous
awareness
of
his
own
superiority
as
if
he
were
saying
to
them
with
his
look
i
know
you
i
know
but
why
should
i
bother
with
you
and
youd
be
glad
if
i
did
perhaps
he
did
not
think
that
when
he
met
women
and
it
is
even
probable
that
he
did
not
because
he
generally
thought
little
but
such
was
his
look
and
manner
the
princess
felt
it
and
as
if
wishing
to
show
him
that
she
dared
not
even
think
of
interesting
him
turned
to
the
old
prince
the
conversation
was
general
and
lively
thanks
to
the
little
princesss
voice
and
the
lip
with
its
little
mustache
which
kept
rising
up
over
her
white
teeth
she
met
prince
vassily
in
that
jocular
mode
often
made
use
of
by
garrulously
merry
people
which
consists
in
the
fact
that
between
the
person
thus
addressed
and
oneself
there
are
supposed
to
exist
some
longestablished
jokes
and
merry
amusing
reminiscences
not
known
to
everyone
when
in
fact
there
are
no
such
reminiscences
as
there
were
none
between
the
little
princess
and
prince
vassily
prince
vassily
readily
yielded
to
this
tone
the
little
princess
also
involved
anatole
whom
she
barely
knew
in
this
reminiscence
of
neverexisting
funny
incidents
mlle
bourienne
also
shared
in
these
common
reminiscences
and
even
princess
marya
enjoyed
feeling
herself
drawn
into
this
merry
reminiscence
so
at
least
we
can
make
full
use
of
you
now
dear
prince
the
little
princess
said
in
french
of
course
to
prince
vassily
it
wont
be
as
at
our
soir233es
at
annettes
where
you
always
run
away
remember
cette
ch232re
annette
ah
but
you
wont
go
talking
politics
with
me
like
annette
and
our
little
tea
table
oh
yes
why
did
you
never
come
to
annettes
the
little
princess
asked
anatole
ah
i
know
i
know
she
said
winking
your
brother
ippolit
has
told
me
about
your
affairs
oh
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
i
even
know
your
parisian
pranks
but
he
ippolit
didnt
he
tell
you
said
prince
vassily
turning
to
his
son
and
seizing
the
princess
by
the
hand
as
if
she
was
about
to
run
away
and
he
had
barely
managed
to
hold
her
back
didnt
he
tell
you
how
he
himself
ippolit
pined
for
the
dear
princess
and
how
she
le
mettait
224
la
porte
oh
cest
la
perle
des
femmes
princesse
he
said
turning
to
princess
marya
for
her
part
mlle
bourienne
did
not
miss
her
chance
at
the
word
paris
to
enter
as
well
into
the
general
conversation
of
reminiscences
she
permitted
herself
to
ask
whether
anatole
had
left
paris
long
ago
and
how
he
liked
the
city
anatole
answered
the
frenchwoman
quite
willingly
and
gazing
at
her
with
a
smile
conversed
with
her
about
her
fatherland
seeing
the
pretty
bourienne
anatole
decided
that
even
here
at
bald
hills
it
would
not
be
boring
not
bad
at
all
he
thought
looking
her
over
shes
not
bad
at
all
this
demoiselle
de
compagnie
i
hope
shell
bring
her
along
when
she
marries
me
he
thought
la
petite
est
gentille
the
old
prince
was
dressing
unhurriedly
in
his
study
frowning
and
thinking
over
what
he
was
going
to
do
the
arrival
of
these
guests
angered
him
what
are
prince
vassily
and
his
boy
to
me
prince
vassilys
an
empty
babbler
so
the
son
must
also
be
a
fine
one
he
grumbled
to
himself
he
was
angry
because
the
arrival
of
these
guests
raised
in
his
soul
an
unresolved
constantly
stifled
questiona
question
in
regard
to
which
the
old
prince
always
deceived
himself
the
question
was
whether
he
could
ever
resolve
to
princess
marya
and
give
her
to
a
husband
the
prince
had
never
ventured
to
ask
himself
this
question
directly
knowing
beforehand
that
he
would
answer
it
in
all
fairness
and
fairness
contradicted
more
than
feeling
it
contradicted
the
whole
possibility
of
his
life
for
prince
nikolai
andreich
life
without
princess
marya
despite
the
fact
that
he
seemed
to
value
her
little
was
unthinkable
and
why
should
she
marry
he
thought
shes
sure
to
be
unhappy
lizas
married
to
andrei
a
better
husband
would
seem
hard
to
find
these
days
but
is
she
pleased
with
her
fate
and
whos
going
to
take
her
out
of
love
shes
plain
awkward
shell
be
taken
for
her
connections
for
her
wealth
dont
girls
live
unmarried
and
all
the
happier
so
thought
prince
nikolai
andreich
as
he
dressed
but
at
the
same
time
the
everdeferred
question
called
for
immediate
resolution
prince
vassily
had
obviously
brought
his
son
with
the
intention
of
making
a
proposal
and
would
probably
ask
for
a
direct
answer
today
or
tomorrow
his
name
his
position
in
society
were
decent
well
im
not
against
it
the
prince
said
to
himself
but
he
must
be
worthy
of
her
well
see
about
that
well
see
about
that
he
said
aloud
well
see
about
that
and
with
brisk
steps
as
usual
he
entered
the
drawing
room
took
everyone
in
with
a
quick
glance
noticed
the
little
princesss
change
of
dress
the
ribbon
on
bourienne
and
princess
maryas
ugly
hairstyle
and
the
smiles
of
bourienne
and
anatole
and
his
daughters
solitude
amidst
the
general
conversation
got
herself
up
like
a
fool
he
thought
looking
spitefully
at
his
daughter
no
shame
and
he
doesnt
even
want
to
know
her
he
went
over
to
prince
vassily
well
greetings
greetings
glad
to
see
you
for
a
dear
friend
no
detours
too
long
prince
vassily
began
as
usual
quickly
selfconfidently
and
familiarly
here
is
my
second
one
i
recommend
him
to
your
loving
kindness
prince
nikolai
andreevich
looked
anatole
over
a
fine
boy
a
fine
boy
he
said
well
come
and
kiss
me
and
he
offered
him
his
cheek
anatole
kissed
the
old
man
then
looked
at
him
curiously
and
with
perfect
calm
expecting
him
to
come
out
with
something
eccentric
as
his
father
had
promised
prince
nikolai
andreevich
sat
in
his
usual
place
at
the
end
of
the
sofa
moved
a
chair
for
prince
vassily
towards
him
pointed
to
it
and
began
asking
questions
about
political
matters
and
the
latest
news
he
listened
as
if
with
attention
to
prince
vassilys
account
but
kept
glancing
at
princess
marya
so
theyre
already
writing
from
potsdam
he
repeated
prince
vassilys
last
words
suddenly
stood
up
and
went
over
to
his
daughter
so
youve
spruced
yourself
up
like
that
for
the
guests
eh
he
said
fine
very
fine
you
do
your
hair
up
in
some
new
way
for
the
guests
but
i
say
to
you
in
front
of
the
guests
that
in
future
you
dare
not
change
anything
without
my
permission
mon

its
my
fault
the
little
princess
intervened
blushing
thats
entirely
as
you
will
maam
said
prince
nikolai
andreevich
bowing
and
scraping
before
his
daughterinlaw
but
she
neednt
make
herself
uglyshes
plain
enough
as
it
is
and
he
sat
down
in
his
place
again
paying
no
further
attention
to
the
daughter
he
had
driven
to
tears
on
the
contrary
this
hairstyle
is
very
becoming
to
the
princess

thought
anatole
and
smiling
he
took
a
seat
nearer
to
the
old
prince
well

the

frowned

said

anatole
with
a
smile
went
back
to
the
ladies
so

old

to

a
fine

fine
lad

he
took
prince
vassily
under
the
arm
and
led
him
to
his
study
prince
vassily
finding
himself
alone
with
the
prince
at
once
declared
to
him
his
wishes
and
hopes
and
what
do
you
think
the
old
prince
said
gruffly
that

he
pronounced
gruffly

prince
snorted

him
its
all
the
same
to
me
he
shrieked
in
the
same
shrill
voice
in
which
he
had
shouted
on
taking
leave
of
his
son
ill
tell
you
straight
out
said
prince
vassily
in
the
tone
of
a
cunning
man
convinced
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
use
cunning
in
view
of
his
interlocutors
perceptiveness
you
see
through
people
anatole
is
no
genius
but
hes
an
honest
good
lad
an
excellent
son
and
one
of
us
well
well
all
right
well
see
as
always
happens
with
lonely
women
who
have
long
lived
without
the
society
of
men
on
anatoles
appearance
all
three
women
in
prince
nikolai
andreevichs
house
felt
equally
that
their
life
had
not
been
life
until
that
moment
the
power
of
thought
feeling
observation
instantly
increased
tenfold
in
them
as
if
their
life
going
on
in
darkness
till
then
was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
new
light
filled
with
meaning
princess
marya
did
not
think
at
all
or
even
remember
about
her
face
and
hairstyle
the
handsome
open
face
of
the
man
who
would
perhaps
be
her
husband
absorbed
all
her
attention
to
her
he
seemed
kind
brave
resolute
manly
and
magnanimous
she
was
convinced
of
it
thousands
of
fancies
of
her
future
family
life
kept
emerging
in
her
imagination
she
drove
them
away
and
tried
to
hide
them
but
am
i
not
too
cold
with
him
thought
princess
marya
im
trying
to
restrain
myself
because
deep
in
my
soul
i
feel
myself
already
too
close
to
him
but
he
doesnt
know
all
that
im
thinking
about
him
and
may
imagine
that
i
find
him
disagreeable
and
princess
marya
tried
and
was
unable
to
be
cordial
with
the
new
guest
la
pauvre
fille
elle
est
diablement
laide
thought
anatole
mlle
bourienne
whom
anatoles
arrival
had
also
brought
to
a
high
level
of
excitement
was
thinking
along
different
lines
of
course
the
beautiful
young
woman
with
no
definite
position
in
the
world
with
no
family
or
friends
or
even
country
did
not
intend
to
devote
her
life
to
serving
prince
nikolai
andreevich
reading
books
to
him
or
being
friends
with
princess
marya
mlle
bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
a
russian
prince
who
would
at
once
be
able
to
appreciate
her
superiority
over
the
plain
badly
dressed
awkward
russian
princesses
would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
carry
her
off
and
this
russian
prince
had
finally
come
mlle
bourienne
had
a
story
heard
from
her
aunt
completed
by
herself
which
she
liked
to
tell
over
in
her
imagination
it
was
a
story
about
a
seduced
girl
whose
poor
mother
sa
pauvre
m232re
appeared
to
her
in
a
vision
and
reproached
her
for
giving
herself
to
a
man
outside
wedlock
mlle
bourienne
often
brought
herself
to
tears
telling
him
the
seducer
this
story
in
her
imagination
now
he
this
real
russian
prince
had
come
he
will
carry
her
off
then
ma
pauvre
m232re
will
appear
and
he
will
marry
her
thus
the
whole
future
story
of
mlle
bourienne
had
taken
shape
in
her
head
while
she
was
talking
with
him
about
paris
mlle
bourienne
was
not
guided
by
calculation
she
did
not
spend
a
moment
thinking
of
what
she
was
to
do
but
it
had
all
been
long
prepared
in
her
and
now
merely
arranged
itself
around
the
visiting
anatole
whom
she
wished
and
strove
to
please
as
much
as
she
could
the
little
princess
like
an
old
warhorse
hearing
the
sound
of
trumpets
was
preparing
herself
unconsciously
and
forgetting
her
condition
for
her
habitual
coquettish
gallop
without
any
second
thoughts
or
struggles
but
with
na239ve
lightminded
merriment
although
anatole
in
womens
company
usually
placed
himself
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
is
sick
of
having
women
running
after
him
he
took
a
vain
pleasure
in
seeing
his
effect
on
these
three
women
besides
he
was
beginning
to
experience
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
bourienne
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
came
over
him
with
extraordinary
quickness
and
urged
him
towards
the
most
coarse
and
bold
actions
after
tea
the
company
went
to
the
sitting
room
and
the
princess
was
asked
to
play
on
the
clavichord
anatole
leaned
on
his
elbow
before
her
next
to
mlle
bourienne
and
his
eyes
laughing
and
joyful
looked
at
princess
marya
princess
marya
felt
his
gaze
upon
her
with
tormenting
and
joyful
excitement
her
favorite
sonata
transported
her
into
her
innermost
poetic
world
and
the
gaze
she
felt
upon
her
endowed
that
world
with
still
greater
poetry
anatoles
gaze
though
directed
at
her
referred
not
to
her
but
to
the
movements
of
mlle
bouriennes
little
foot
which
he
touched
just
then
with
his
own
foot
under
the
pianoforte
mlle
bourienne
was
also
looking
at
the
princess
and
in
her
beautiful
eyes
there
was
an
expression
of
frightened
joy
and
hope
which
was
also
new
for
princess
marya
how
she
loves
me
thought
princess
marya
how
happy
i
am
now
and
how
happy
i
may
be
with
such
a
friend
and
such
a
husband
can
it
bea
husband
she
thought
not
daring
to
look
up
at
his
face
still
feeling
that
same
gaze
directed
at
her
in
the
evening
when
they
all
began
to
disperse
after
supper
anatole
kissed
princess
maryas
hand
she
did
not
know
herself
how
she
had
boldness
enough
but
she
glanced
straight
at
the
beautiful
face
as
it
approached
her
nearsighted
eyes
after
the
princess
he
went
to
kiss
mlle
bouriennes
hand
this
was
improper
but
he
did
everything
so
confidently
and
simply
and
mlle
bourienne
blushed
and
glanced
fearfully
at
the
princess
quelle
d233licatesse
thought
the
princess
can
am233lie
that
was
mlle
bouriennes
name
really
think
i
could
be
jealous
of
her
and
not
appreciate
her
pure
affection
for
and
devotion
to
me
she
went
over
to
mlle
bourienne
and
kissed
her
warmly
anatole
went
to
kiss
the
little
princesss
hand
non
non
non
quand
votre
p232re
m233crira
que
vous
vous
conduisez
bien
je
vous
donnerai
ma

baiser
pas
avant
and
raising
her
finger
and
smiling
she
left
the
room
v
they
all
dispersed
and
except
for
anatole
who
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
lay
down
it
was
long
before
anyone
slept
that
night
can
it
be
that
hes
my
husband
precisely
this
stranger
this
handsome
kind
manabove
all
kind
thought
princess
marya
and
fear
which
hardly
ever
came
to
her
came
over
her
now
she
was
afraid
to
look
around
she
fancied
someone
was
standing
there
behind
the
screen
in
the
dark
corner
and
that
someone
was
hethe
deviland
he
was
this
man
with
the
white
forehead
black
eyebrows
and
red
mouth
she
rang
for
the
maid
and
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
mlle
bourienne
spent
a
long
time
that
evening
walking
in
the
winter
garden
vainly
waiting
for
someone
and
now
smiling
at
someone
now
waxing
tearful
touched
in
her
imagination
by
the
words
of
sa
pauvre
m232re
reproaching
her
for
her
fall
the
little
princess
grumbled
at
her
maid
because
the
bed
was
not
right
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
lie
either
on
her
side
or
on
her
front
everything
was
heavy
and
awkward
her
belly
got
in
her
way
it
got
in
her
way
more
than
ever
precisely
today
because
anatoles
presence
transported
her
more
vividly
into
another
time
when
it
was
not
there
and
everything
was
light
and
merry
for
her
she
sat
in
an
armchair
in
her
bedjacket
and
nightcap
katya
sleepy
and
with
her
braid
tangled
plumped
up
and
turned
the
heavy
featherbed
for
the
third
time
muttering
something
i
told
you
its
all
bumps
and
hollows
the
little
princess
repeated
id
be
glad
to
fall
asleep
myself
so
its
not
my
fault
and
her
voice
quavered
like
the
voice
of
a
child
who
is
about
to
cry
the
old
prince
was
also
awake
tikhon
through
his
sleep
heard
him
pacing
about
angrily
and
snorting
through
his
nose
it
seemed
to
the
old
prince
that
he
was
offended
for
his
daughter
the
offense
was
most
painful
because
it
concerned
not
himself
but
another
his
daughter
whom
he
loved
more
than
himself
he
told
himself
that
he
would
think
over
the
whole
matter
again
and
find
what
was
fair
and
ought
to
be
done
but
instead
he
only
irritated
himself
more
the
first
comer
turns
upand
her
father
and
everythings
forgotten
and
she
runs
does
her
hair
up
and
wags
her
tail
and
isnt
like
herself
at
all
glad
to
abandon
her
father
she
knew
id
notice
snortsnortsnortas
if
i
dont
see
that
this
fool
is
only
looking
at
bourrienka
she
must
be
thrown
out
and
how
can
she
not
have
enough
pride
to
realize
it
if
she
has
no
pride
for
herself
at
least
she
could
have
it
for
me
she
must
be
shown
that
that
blockhead
doesnt
even
give
her
a
thought
but
is
only
looking
at
bourienne
she
has
no
pride
but
ill
show
her
that
she
by
telling
his
daughter
that
she
was
mistaken
that
anatole
intended
to
pay
court
to
bourienne
the
old
prince
knew
he
would
rouse
princess
maryas
amour
propre
and
his
cause
the
wish
not
to
his
daughter
would
be
won
and
that
calmed
him
down
he
called
tikhon
and
began
to
undress
the
devil
brought
them
here
he
thought
as
tikhon
slipped
a
nightgown
over
his
dry
old
mans
body
the
chest
overgrown
with
gray
hair
i
didnt
invite
them
theyve
come
to
upset
my
life
and
theres
not
much
left
of
it
devil
take
them
he
said
while
the
shirt
still
covered
his
head
tikhon
knew
the
princes
habit
of
sometimes
expressing
his
thoughts
aloud
and
therefore
with
an
unchanged
face
met
the
irately
questioning
gaze
of
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
shirt
gone
to
bed
asked
the
prince
tikhon
like
all
good
valets
instinctively
knew
his
masters
train
of
thought
he
guessed
that
he
was
being
asked
about
prince
vassily
and
his
son
theyve
gone
to
bed
and
put
out
the
lights
if
you
please
your
excellency
no
need
no
need
the
prince
said
quickly
and
putting
his
feet
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
through
the
sleeves
of
his
dressing
gown
he
went
to
the
sofa
on
which
he
slept
though
nothing
had
yet
been
said
between
anatole
and
mlle
bourienne
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
in
regard
to
the
first
the
romance
before
the
appearance
of
the
pauvre
m232re
understood
that
they
had
much
to
tell
each
other
in
secret
and
therefore
in
the
morning
they
both
sought
an
occasion
to
see
each
other
alone
when
princess
marya
went
at
the
usual
hour
to
see
her
father
mlle
bourienne
met
with
anatole
in
the
winter
garden
princess
marya
came
to
her
fathers
door
that
day
with
particular
trepidation
it
seemed
to
her
not
only
that
everyone
knew
her
fate
was
to
be
decided
that
day
but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about
it
she
read
that
expression
on
the
face
of
tikhon
and
on
the
face
of
prince
vassilys
valet
who
met
her
in
the
corridor
while
carrying
hot
water
and
bowed
low
to
her
the
old
prince
was
extremely
gentle
and
painstaking
in
dealing
with
his
daughter
that
morning
princess
marya
knew
this
painstaking
expression
of
her
fathers
very
well
it
was
the
expression
he
had
on
his
face
in
the
moments
when
his
dry
hands
clenched
into
fists
from
vexation
at
princess
maryas
not
understanding
a
problem
in
arithmetic
and
getting
up
he
would
step
away
from
her
and
in
a
soft
voice
repeat
the
same
words
several
times
he
got
down
to
business
straightaway
and
began
the
conversation
in
a
formal
tone
a
proposal
has
been
made
to
me
concerning
you
miss
he
said
smiling
unnaturally
you
have
guessed
i
believe
he
went
on
that
prince
vassily
came
here
and
brought
with
him
his
pupil
for
some
reason
prince
nikolai
andreich
called
anatole
a
pupil
not
just
for
my
good
pleasure
a
proposal
was
made
to
me
yesterday
concerning
you
and
since
you
know
my
rules
i
am
referring
it
to
you
how
am
i
to
understand

said
the
princess
turning
pale
then
red
how

her
father
cried
irately
prince
vassily

his
taste
as
his
daughterinlaw
and
proposes

behalf
of
his
pupil
thats

i

in
a
whisper
i

me
out
of
it
its
not
i
who
am
getting
married
what
about
you
miss
thats
what
its
desirable
to
know
the
princess
saw
that
her
father
looked
unfavorably
on
this
matter
but
at
the
same
moment
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
fate
in
life
would
be
decided
now
or
never
she
lowered
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
his
gaze
under
the
influence
of
which
she
felt
she
could
not
think
but
only
obey
out
of
habit
and
said
i
desire
only
one
thingto
do
your
will
she
said
but
if
my
desire
must
needs
be
expressed
she
did
not
have
time
to
finish
the
prince
interrupted
her
splendid
he
cried
hell

you
and
your
dowry
and
incidentally
take
along
mlle
bourienne
shell
be
his
wife
and
you
the
prince
stopped
he
noticed
the
impression
these
words
made
on
his
daughter
she
hung
her
head
and
was
about
to
cry
well
well
im
joking
im
joking
he
said

one
thing

to
the
rule
that

girl

full
right
to
choose
and
i

only

he
went
on
shouting
once
the
princess
reeling
as
if
in
a
fog
had
left
his
study
her
fate
was
decided
and
decided
happily
but
what
her
father
had
said
about
mlle
bouriennethat
was
a
terrible
hint
untrue
let
us
suppose
but
all
the
same
it
was
terrible
she
could
not
help
thinking
about
it
she
was
walking
straight
ahead
through
the
winter
garden
without
seeing
or
hearing
anything
when
suddenly
the
familiar
whispering
of
mlle
bourienne
roused
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
anatole
two
steps
away
from
her
embracing
the
frenchwoman
and
whispering
something
to
her
anatole
with
a
frightful
expression
on
his
handsome
face
turned
to
look
at
princess
marya
and
for
the
first
second
did
not
let
go
of
the
waist
of
mlle
bourienne
who
did
not
see
her
whos
there
why
wait
anatoles
face
seemed
to
say
princess
marya
was
looking
at
them
silently
she
could
not
understand
it
finally
mlle
bourienne
gave
a
little
cry
and
ran
away
anatole
with
a
merry
smile
bowed
to
princess
marya
as
if
inviting
her
to
laugh
at
this
odd
incident
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
that
led
to
his
the
house
an
hour
later
tikhon
came
to
summon
princess
marya
he
summoned
her
to
the
prince
and
added
that
prince
vassily
sergeich
was
also
there
when
tikhon
came
the
princess
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
holding
the
weeping
mlle
bourienne
in
her
arms
princess
marya
was
gently
stroking
her
head
her
beautiful
eyes
with
all
their
former
calm
and
luminosity
looked
at
the
pretty
face
of
mlle
bourienne
with
tender
love
and
pity
non

with
a
sad
smile

she
said
and
went
out
prince
vassily
one
leg
crossed
high
up
on
the
other
a
snuffbox
in
his
hand
as
if
moved
to
the
utmost
and
as
if
regretting
and
laughing
at
his
sentimentality
himself
was
sitting
with
a
smile
of
tender
emotion
on
his
face
when
princess
marya
came
in
he
quickly
brought
a
pinch
of
snuff
to
his
nose
ah

bonne

bonne
he
said
rising
and
taking
her
by
both
hands
he
sighed
and
added

for
a
long
time
the
rostovs
had
no
news
of
nikolushka
only
in
midwinter
was
the
count
handed
a
letter
addressed
in
what
he
recognized
as
his
sons
handwriting
on
receiving
the
letter
the
count
fearfully
and
hastily
trying
not
to
be
noticed
ran
on
tiptoe
to
his
study
shut
himself
in
and
began
to
read
anna
mikhailovna
learning
as
she
knew
everything
that
went
on
in
the
house
of
the
letter
that
had
come
went
into
the
counts
study
with
soft
steps
and
found
him
with
the
letter
in
his
hands
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
anna
mikhailovna
though
her
affairs
had
improved
went
on
living
with
the
rostovs
mon

anna
mikhailovna
uttered
with
questioning
sadness
and
a
readiness
for
all
sorts
of
sympathy

anna

sat
down
beside
him
took
her
handkerchief
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
the
letter
stained
by
them
and
her
own
tears
read
the
letter
reassured
the
count
and
decided
that
she
would
prepare
the
countess
over
dinner
and
before
tea
and
after
tea
would
announce
everything
with
gods
help
all
through
dinner
anna
mikhailovna
talked
about
rumors
of
the
war
about
nikolushka
she
asked
twice
when
the
last
letter
had
come
from
him
though
she
already
knew
and
observed
that
a
letter
could
very
easily
come
that
day
each
time
these
hints
made
the
countess
begin
to
worry
and
look
anxiously
now
at
the
count
now
at
anna
mikhailovna
anna
mikhailovna
quite
imperceptibly
turned
the
conversation
to
insignificant
subjects
natasha
the
best
endowed
of
all
the
family
with
the
ability
to
detect
the
nuances
of
intonations
glances
and
facial
expressions
had
pricked
up
her
ears
since
the
beginning
of
dinner
and
knew
that
there
was
something
between
her
father
and
anna
mikhailovna
and
something
concerning
her
brother
and
that
anna
mikhailovna
was
making
preparations
in
spite
of
all
her
boldness
natasha
knew
how
sensitive
her
mother
was
to
everything
that
had
to
do
with
news
of
nikolushka
she
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
during
dinner
and
ate
nothing
from
anxiousness
and
fidgeted
on
her
chair
not
listening
to
her
governesss
reproaches
after
dinner
she
rushed
headlong
after
anna
mikhailovna
and
threw
herself
on
her
neck
at
full
speed
in
the
sitting
room

she
said
a
letter
from

cried
natasha
reading
the
affirmative
answer
in
anna

face

anna
mikhailovna
briefly
recounted
to
natasha
the
contents
of
the
letter
on
condition
that
she
not
tell
anyone
my
noble
word
of
honor
said
natasha
crossing
herself
i
wont
tell
anyoneand
she
immediately
ran
to
sonya
nikolenkawoundeda
letter
she
said
solemnly
and
joyfully
nicolas
sonya
merely
said
instantly
turning
pale
seeing
the
impression
the
news
of
her
brothers
wound
made
on
sonya
natasha
felt
for
the
first
time
the
whole
grievous
side
of
this
news
she
rushed
to
sonya
embraced
her
and
wept
slightly
wounded
but
promoted
to
officer
hes
recovered
now
he
wrote
himself
she
said
through
her
tears
its
obvious
all
you

crybabies
said
petya
pacing
the
room
in
big
resolute
strides

very
glad

distinguished
himself

natasha
smiled
through
her
tears
you

letter
asked
sonya

i
havent
but
she
said
its
all
over
and
hes
already
an
officer
thank
god
said
sonya
crossing
herself
but
maybe
she
deceived
you
lets
go
to
maman
petya
silently
paced
the
room
if
i
were
in
nikolushkas
place
id
have
killed
even
more
of
those
frenchmen
he
said
theyre
so
disgusting

thered
be
a
whole
pile
petya
went
on
shut
up
petya
what
a
fool
you
are
im
not
a
fool
the
fools
are
the
ones
who
cry
over
trifles
said
petya
do
you
remember
him
natasha
suddenly
asked
after
a
moments
silence
sonya
smiled
do
i
remember
nicolas
no
sonya
do
you
remember
him
so
as
to
remember
everything
remember
really
well
said
natasha
with
an
assiduous
gesture
evidently
wishing
to
give
her
words
the
most
serious
meaning
i
remember
nikolenka
too
i
do
she
said
but
not
boris
i
dont
remember
him
at
all
what
you
dont
remember
boris
sonya
asked
in
surprise
its
not
that
i
dont
remember
himi
know
how
he
is
but
i
dont
remember
him
the
way
i
do
nikolenka
i
close
my
eyes
and
i
remember
him
but
boris
i
dont
she
closed
her
eyes
nonothing
ah
natasha
sonya
said
rapturously
and
seriously
without
looking
at
her
friend
as
if
she
considered
her
unworthy
of
what
she
intended
to
say
and
as
if
she
was
saying
it
to
someone
else
with
whom
it
was
impossible
to
joke
ive
fallen
in
love
with
your
brother
once
and
for
all
and
whatever
happens
to
him
or
to
me
i
will
never
stop
loving
himall
my
life
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
astonished
curious
eyes
and
said
nothing
she
felt
that
what
sonya
had
said
was
true
that
there
was
such
love
as
sonya
was
talking
about
but
natasha
had
never
experienced
anything
like
that
she
believed
it
could
be
but
did
not
understand
it
will
you
write
to
him
she
asked
sonya
fell
to
thinking
the
question
of
how
to
write
to
nicolas
and
whether
she
should
write
to
him
was
a
question
that
tormented
her
now
that
he
was
already
an
officer
and
a
wounded
hero
would
it
be
right
on
her
remind
him
of
herself
and
as
it
were
of
the
commitment
he
had
taken
upon
himself
in
her
regard
i
dont
know
i
think
since
he
writes
ill
write
too
she
said
blushing
and
you
wont
be
ashamed
to
write
to
him
sonya
smiled
no
but
id
be
ashamed
to
write
to
boris
so
i
wont
ashamed
of
what
just
so
i
dont
know
awkward
ashamed
but
i
know
why
shed
be
ashamed
said
petya
offended
by
natashas
first
remark
because
she
was
in
love
with
that
fat
one
in
spectacles
so
petya
described
his
namesake
the
new
count
bezukhov
now
shes
in
love
with
this
singer
petya
was
referring
to
natashas
italian
singing
teacher
so
shes
ashamed
petya
youre
stupid
said
natasha
no
stupider
than
you
old
girl
said
the
nineyearold
petya
as
if
he
was
an
old
brigadier
the
countess
had
been
prepared
during
dinner
by
anna
mikhailovnas
hints
going
to
her
room
she
sat
in
an
armchair
not
taking
her
eyes
from
the
miniature
portrait
of
her
son
on
a
snuffbox
and
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
anna
mikhailovna
came
to
the
countesss
room
on
tiptoe
with
the
letter
and
paused
dont
come
in
she
said
to
the
old
count
who
was
following
her
later
she
said
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
the
count
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
began
to
listen
at
first
he
heard
the
sounds
of
indifferent
talk
then
only
the
sound
of
anna
mikhailovnas
voice
making
a
long
speech
then
a
cry
then
silence
then
both
voices
again
speaking
together
with
joyful
intonations
and
then
footsteps
and
then
anna
mikhailovna
opened
the
door
to
him
anna
mikhailovnas
face
bore
the
proud
expression
of
a
surgeon
who
has
completed
a
difficult
amputation
and
admits
the
public
so
that
it
can
appreciate
his
art
cest
fait
she
said
to
the
count
pointing
with
a
solemn
gesture
to
the
countess
who
was
holding
the
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
in
one
hand
and
the
letter
in
the
other
and
pressing
her
lips
first
to
the
one
then
to
the
other
seeing
the
count
she
held
her
arms
out
to
him
embraced
his
bald
head
and
again
over
his
bald
head
looked
at
the
letter
and
the
portrait
and
again
pushed
the
bald
head
slightly
away
so
as
to
press
her
lips
to
them
vera
natasha
sonya
and
petya
came
into
the
room
and
the
reading
began
in
the
letter
nikolushka
gave
a
brief
description
of
the
march
the
two
battles
in
which
he
had
taken
part
and
his
promotion
to
officer
and
said
that
he
kissed
the
hands
of
maman
and
papa
asking
their
blessing
and
kissed
vera
natasha
and
petya
besides
that
he
sent
his
greetings
to
m
schelling
and
mme
schoss
and
the
nanny
and
besides
that
he
asked
them
to
kiss
his
dear
sonya
whom
he
loved
as
ever
and
remembered
as
ever
hearing
that
sonya
blushed
so
much
that
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
unable
to
bear
the
gazes
turned
to
her
she
rushed
to
the
ballroom
made
a
run
twirled
and
her
dress
ballooning
all
flushed
and
smiling
sat
down
on
the
floor
the
countess
was
crying
what
are
you
crying
for
maman
said
vera
from
all
that
he
writes
you
should
rejoice
and
not
cry
that
was
perfectly
correct
but
the
count
and
the
countess
and
natashaeveryone
looked
at
her
with
reproach
who
does
she
take
after
thought
the
countess
nikolushkas
letter
was
read
a
hundred
times
and
those
who
were
deemed
worthy
of
listening
to
it
had
to
come
to
the
countess
who
never
let
it
out
of
her
hands
tutors
nannies
mitenka
some
acquaintances
came
and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
each
time
with
new
delight
and
each
time
through
this
letter
discovered
new
virtues
in
her
nikolushka
how
strange
extraordinary
joyful
it
was
that
her
sonthat
son
who
twenty
years
ago
had
moved
his
tiny
limbs
barely
perceptibly
inside
her
that
son
over
whom
she
had
quarreled
with
the
tooindulgent
count
that
son
who
had
first
learned
to
say
brush
and
then
mama
that
this
son
was
now
there
in
a
foreign
land
in
foreign
surroundings
a
manly
warrior
alone
with
no
help
or
guidance
and
doing
there
some
manly
business
of
his
own
all
the
worldwide
ageold
experience
showing
that
children
grow
in
an
imperceptible
way
from
the
cradle
to
manhood
did
not
exist
for
the
countess
her
sons
maturing
had
been
at
every
point
as
extraordinary
for
her
as
if
there
had
not
been
millions
upon
millions
of
men
who
had
matured
in
just
the
same
way
as
it
was
hard
to
believe
twenty
years
ago
that
the
little
being
who
lived
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
start
crying
and
suck
her
breast
and
begin
to
talk
so
now
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
this
same
being
could
be
the
strong
brave
man
an
example
to
sons
and
people
that
he
was
now
judging
by
this
letter
what
shtil
how
nicely
he
describes
things
she
said
reading
the
descriptive
the
letter
and
what
soul
nothing
about
himselfnothing
about
some
denisov
but
he
himself
is
probably
braver
than
all
of
them
he
writes
nothing
about
his
sufferings
and
what
heart
its
so
like
him
and
how
he
remembered
everyone
he
didnt
forget
anybody
i
always
always
said
when
he
was
only
so
high
i
always
said
for
more
than
a
week
the
whole
house
prepared
wrote
drafts
and
rewrote
clean
copies
of
letters
to
nikolushka
under
the
countesss
supervision
and
the
counts
solicitude
the
necessary
things
and
money
were
gathered
to
outfit
the
newly
promoted
officer
and
provide
for
his
needs
anna
mikhailovna
a
practical
woman
had
been
able
to
arrange
patronage
for
herself
and
her
son
in
the
army
even
for
purposes
of
correspondence
she
could
send
her
letters
to
the
grand
duke
konstantin
pavlovich
who
commanded
the
guards
the
rostovs
assumed
that
the
address
russian
guards
abroad
was
a
perfectly
definite
address
and
that
if
the
letter
reached
the
grand
duke
who
was
in
command
of
the
guards
there
was
no
reason
to
think
it
would
not
reach
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
which
should
be
in
the
vicinity
and
therefore
it
was
decided
to
send
the
letters
and
money
through
the
grand
dukes
courier
to
boris
and
boris
would
have
to
deliver
them
to
nikolushka
there
were
letters
from
the
old
count
from
the
countess
from
petya
from
vera
from
natasha
and
from
sonya
and
finally
6000
roubles
for
outfitting
as
well
as
various
things

count
sent
to
his

he
was
in
a
muchworn
junkers
jacket
with
a
soldiers
cross
the
same
sort
of
riding
breeches
with
a
shabby
leather
seat
and
an
officers
saber
with
a
sword
knot
he
was
riding
a
don
horse
that
he
had
bought
from
a
cossack
while
on
campaign
his
crumpled
hussars
cap
was
dashingly
pushed
back
and
cocked
riding
up
to
the
camp
of
the
izmailovsky
regiment
he
was
thinking
about
how
he
would
impress
boris
and
all
his
comrades
in
the
guards
by
his
look
of
a
battleseasoned
hussar
the
guards
had
made
the
whole
march
as
if
on
a
promenade
showing
off
their
cleanness
and
discipline
the
stages
were
short
their
packs
were
transported
in
wagons
the
austrian
authorities
prepared
excellent
dinners
for
the
officers
all
along
the
way
the
regiments
entered
and
left
towns
to
music
and
for
the
whole
march
something
the
guards
took
pride
in
on
the
order
of
the
grand
duke
the
men
had
walked
in
step
the
officers
on
foot
at
their
posts
all
during
the
march
boris
had
walked
and
quartered
with
berg
who
was
now
already
a
company
commander
berg
who
had
obtained
the
company
during
the
march
had
managed
by
his
efficiency
and
neatness
to
earn
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
and
had
arranged
his
financial
affairs
rather
profitably
boris
had
made
many
acquaintances
during
the
march
with
people
who
could
be
useful
to
him
and
through
a
letter
of
recommendation
brought
to
him
from
pierre
had
become
acquainted
with
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
through
whom
he
hoped
to
get
a
post
on
the
commander
in
chiefs
staff
berg
and
boris
cleanly
and
neatly
dressed
having
rested
after
the
days
march
were
sitting
at
a
round
table
in
the
clean
apartment
assigned
to
them
and
playing
checkers
berg
was
holding
a
smoking
little
pipe
between
his
knees
boris
with
his
particular
neatness
had
piled
the
pieces
in
a
pyramid
with
his
slender
white
hands
waiting
for
bergs
move
and
watching
his
partners
face
obviously
thinking
about
the
game
as
he
always
thought
only
about
what
he
was
engaged
in
well
how
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
that
he
said
well
try
replied
berg
touching
a
piece
and
taking
his
hand
away
again
just
then
the
door
opened
ah
here
he
is
at
last
cried
rostov
and
bergs
here
too
ah
you
petisenfan
allay
cushay
dormir
he
cried
repeating
the
words
of
their
nanny
at
whom
he
and
boris
used
to
laugh
together
good
heavens
how
youve
changed
boris
rose
to
meet
rostov
but
in
rising
did
not
forget
to
pick
up
the
fallen
chessmen
and
put
them
in
place
and
was
about
to
embrace
his
friend
but
nikolai
drew
back
from
him
with
that
feeling
peculiar
to
youth
which
fears
beaten
paths
and
wants
not
to
imitate
others
but
to
express
its
feelings
in
a
new
personal
way
only
not
in
the
often
feigned
way
its
elders
do
nikolai
wanted
to
do
something
special
on
meeting
his
friend
he
wanted
somehow
to
pinch
or
push
boris
only
not
to
kiss
him
as
everybody
does
boris
on
the
contrary
calmly
and
amicably
embraced
rostov
and
kissed
him
three
times
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
nearly
half
a
year
and
at
their
age
when
young
men
take
their
first
steps
on
lifes
path
they
both
found
enormous
changes
in
each
other
totally
new
reflections
of
the
society
in
which
they
had
taken
their
first
steps
in
life
both
had
changed
greatly
since
their
last
meeting
and
both
wanted
the
sooner
to
show
each
other
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
them
ah
you
cursed
floorscrubbers
clean
fresh
as
if
from
a
promenade
not
like
us
sinful
army
folk
rostov
said
with
baritone
sounds
in
his
voice
and
an
army
manner
that
were
new
for
boris
pointing
to
his
mudsplashed
breeches
the
german
landlady
stuck
her
head
through
the
door
hearing
rostovs
loud
voice
a
pretty
little
thing
eh
he
said
winking
why
are
you
shouting
so
youll
frighten
them
said
boris
i
wasnt
expecting
you
today
he
added
i
sent
you
a
note
just
yesterday
through
an
acquaintance
kutuzovs
adjutantbolkonsky
i
didnt
think
hed
deliver
it
to
you
so
soonwell
how
are
you
already
been
under
fire
asked
boris
rostov
without
answering
shook
the
soldiers
cross
of
st
george
that
hung
on
the
cords
of
his
uniform
and
pointing
to
his
arm
in
a
sling
looked
smiling
at
berg
as
you
see
he
said
well
there
yes
yes
boris
said
smiling
and
we
also
had
a
nice
march
you
know
the
grand
duke
constantly
rode
with
our
regiment
and
so
we
had
all
the
conveniences
and
advantages
the
receptions
we
had
in
poland
the
dinners
the
ballsi
cant
tell
you
and
the
grand
duke
was
very
gracious
to
all
our
officers
and
the
two
friends
began
telling
each
otherthe
one
about
his
hussar
carousing
and
life
at
the
front
the
other
about
the
pleasures
and
advantages
of
serving
under
the
command
of
highly
placed
persons
and
so
on
oh
you
guards
said
rostov
but
listen
send
for
some
wine
boris
winced
if
youre
sure
you
want
it
he
said
and
going
to
his
bed
he
took
a
purse
from
under
the
clean
pillows
and
ordered
wine
brought
yes
and
i
have
to
give
you
your
money
and
letter
he
added
rostov
took
the
letter
and
throwing
the
money
on
the
sofa
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
table
and
began
to
read
he
read
a
few
lines
and
glanced
angrily
at
berg
having
met
his
eyes
rostov
covered
his
face
with
the
letter
they
sent
you
a
decent
sum
of
money
though
said
berg
looking
at
the
heavy
purse
pressing
down
on
the
sofa
and
we
just
get
by
on
our
pay
count
ill
tell
you
about
myself
the
thing
is
this
berg
my
dear
said
rostov
if
you
received
a
letter
from
home
and
met
one
of
your
people
whom
youd
like
to
question
about
everything
and
i
happened
to
be
thereid
leave
at
once
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
you
listen
please
go
away
somewhere
anywhereto
the
devil
he
cried
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulder
at
once
and
looking
amiably
into
his
face
obviously
trying
to
soften
the
rudeness
of
his
words
he
added
you
know
dont
be
angry
my
dear
kind
fellow
im
speaking
from
the
heart
as
to
our
old
acquaintance
ah
for
pitys
sake
count
i
understand
very
well
said
berg
getting
up
and
speaking
to
himelf
in
a
guttural
voice
go
across
to
the
landlords
they
invited
you
added
boris
berg
put
on
the
cleanest
of
frock
coats
with
not
a
spot
or
speck
on
it
fluffed
up
his
whiskers
in
front
of
the
mirror
as
alexander
pavlovich
wore
them
and
assuring
himself
from
rostovs
glance
that
his
frock
coat
had
been
noticed
left
the
room
with
a
pleasant
smile
ah
what
a
beast
i
am
though
said
rostov
reading
the
letter
whats
wrong
ah
what
a
swine
i
am
though
that
i
didnt
write
even
once
and
frightened
them
so
ah
what
a
swine
i
am
he
repeated
suddenly
blushing
so
send
gavrilo
for
wine
lets
have
a
drink
he
said
among
the
letters
from
his
family
there
was
also
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
prince
bagration
which
the
old
countess
had
obtained
through
acquaintances
on
the
advice
of
anna
mikhailovna
and
sent
on
to
her
son
asking
him
to
take
it
to
its
destination
and
make
use
of
it
what
stupidity
as
if
i
need
it
said
rostov
throwing
the
letter
under
the
table
why
did
you
throw
it
on
the
floor
asked
boris
its
some
sort
of
letter
of
recommendation
what
the
devil
is
a
letter
to
me
how
do
you
mean
what
the
devil
is
a
letter
said
boris
picking
it
up
and
reading
the
address
you
need
this
letter
very
much
i
dont
need
anything
and
i
wont
go
and
be
anybodys
adjutant
why
not
asked
boris
its
a
lackeys
job
youre
still
the
same
dreamer
i
see
said
boris
shaking
his
head
and
youre
the
same
diplomat
well
but
thats
not
the
pointwell
how
are
you
asked
rostov
as
you
see
so
far
everythings
fine
but
i
confess
my
wish
and
its
a
great
one
is
to
become
an
adjutant
and
not
stay
at
the
front
why
because
once
youve
set
out
on
a
career
in
military
service
you
should
try
to
do
all
you
can
to
make
it
a
brilliant
career
ah
so
thats
it
said
rostov
evidently
thinking
about
something
else
he
looked
intently
and
questioningly
into
his
friends
eyes
evidently
searching
in
vain
for
the
answer
to
some
question
old
gavrilo
brought
the
wine
shouldnt
we
send
for
alphonse
karlych
now
asked
boris
hell
drink
with
you
i
cant
send
for
him
send
for
him
well
and
whats
this
german
like
rostov
asked
with
a
scornful
smile
hes
a
very
good
honest
and
agreeable
man
said
boris
rostov
once
again
looked
intently
into
boriss
eyes
and
sighed
berg
returned
and
over
a
bottle
of
wine
the
conversation
of
these
three
officers
became
animated
the
two
guardsmen
told
rostov
about
their
march
about
how
they
were
honored
in
russia
poland
and
abroad
they
told
about
the
words
and
deeds
of
their
commander
the
grand
duke
anecdotes
about
his
kindness
and
hot
temper
berg
as
usual
kept
silent
when
things
did
not
concern
him
personally
but
on
the
occasion
of
anecdotes
about
the
grand
dukes
hot
temper
he
told
with
delight
how
in
galicia
he
had
managed
to
talk
with
the
grand
duke
when
he
was
making
the
rounds
of
the
regiments
and
waxed
wroth
at
the
incorrectness
of
a
maneuver
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
he
told
how
the
grand
duke
in
great
wrath
had
ridden
up
to
him
and
shouted
arnauti
arnauti
was
his
highnesss
favorite
word
when
he
was
wrathful
and
summoned
the
regimental
commander
would
you
believe
it
count
i
wasnt
afraid
at
all
because
i
knew
i
was
right
you
know
count
i
can
say
without
boasting
that
i
know
the
regimental
orders
by
heart
and
i
also
know
the
regulations
like
the
our
father
in
heaven
thats
why
theres
no
negligence
in
my
company
count
so
my
conscience
was
at
ease
i
presented
myself
berg
stood
up
and
impersonated
how
he
had
presented
himself
with
his
hand
to
his
visor
indeed
it
would
be
hard
to
impersonate
any
greater
deference
and
selfsatisfaction
he
roasted
me
as
they
say
roasted
roasted
roasted
me
not
to
the
quick
but
to
death
as
they
say
arnauti
and
devils
and
to
siberia
berg
said
smiling
shrewdly
i
know
im
right
so
i
say
nothing
isnt
that
the
way
count
are
you
mute
or
what
he
shouts
i
still
say
nothing
and
what
do
you
think
count
the
next
day
there
was
nothing
in
the
orders
thats
what
it
means
not
to
get
flustered
there
you
are
count
said
berg
lighting
his
pipe
and
letting
out
little
smoke
rings
yes
very
nice
said
rostov
smiling
but
boris
noticing
that
rostov
was
preparing
to
make
fun
of
berg
artfully
diverted
the
conversation
he
asked
rostov
to
tell
them
how
and
where
he
had
received
his
wound
this
pleased
rostov
and
he
began
telling
the
story
growing
more
and
more
animated
as
it
went
on
he
told
them
about
his
sch246ngraben
action
in
just
the
way
that
those
who
take
battles
usually
tell
about
them
that
is
in
the
way
they
would
like
it
to
have
been
the
way
they
have
heard
others
tell
it
the
way
it
could
be
told
more
beautifully
but
not
at
all
the
way
it
had
been
rostov
was
a
truthful
young
man
not
for
anything
would
he
have
deliberately
told
an
untruth
he
began
telling
the
story
with
the
intention
of
telling
it
exactly
as
it
had
been
but
imperceptibly
involuntarily
and
inevitably
for
himself
he
went
over
into
untruth
if
he
had
told
the
truth
to
these
listeners
who
like
himself
had
already
heard
accounts
of
attacks
numerous
times
and
had
formed
for
themselves
a
definite
notion
of
what
an
attack
was
and
were
expecting
exactly
the
same
sort
of
accountthey
either
would
not
have
believed
him
or
worse
still
would
have
thought
it
was
rostovs
own
fault
that
what
usually
happens
in
stories
of
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
with
him
he
could
not
simply
tell
them
that
they
all
set
out
at
a
trot
he
fell
off
his
horse
dislocated
his
arm
and
ran
to
the
woods
as
fast
as
he
could
to
escape
a
frenchman
besides
in
order
to
tell
everything
as
it
had
been
one
would
have
to
make
an
effort
with
oneself
so
as
to
tell
only
what
had
been
to
tell
the
truth
is
very
difficult
and
young
men
are
rarely
capable
of
it
they
were
expecting
an
account
of
how
he
got
all
fired
up
forgetting
himself
how
he
flew
like
a
storm
at
the
square
how
he
cut
his
way
into
it
hacking
right
and
left
how
his
saber
tasted
flesh
how
he
fell
exhausted
and
so
on
and
he
told
them
all
that
in
the
middle
of
his
story
just
as
he
was
saying
you
cant
imagine
what
a
strange
feeling
of
fury
one
experiences
during
an
attack
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
whom
boris
was
expecting
came
in
prince
andrei
who
liked
to
patronize
young
men
who
was
flattered
to
be
turned
to
for
a
favor
and
was
welldisposed
towards
boris
who
had
managed
to
please
him
the
day
before
wished
to
fulfill
the
young
mans
wish
sent
by
kutuzov
with
papers
for
the
grand
duke
he
stopped
to
see
the
young
man
hoping
to
find
him
alone
coming
into
the
room
and
seeing
a
frontline
hussar
telling
about
his
military
adventures
the
sort
of
people
prince
andrei
could
not
stand
he
smiled
affectionately
to
boris
winced
narrowed
his
eyes
at
rostov
and
bowing
slightly
sat
down
wearily
and
lazily
on
the
sofa
he
was
not
pleased
to
have
landed
among
bad
company
rostov
blushed
understanding
that
but
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
the
man
was
an
outsider
but
glancing
at
boris
he
saw
that
he
too
seemed
ashamed
of
the
frontline
hussar
in
spite
of
prince
andreis
unpleasant
mocking
tone
in
spite
of
the
general
disdain
which
rostov
from
his
fighting
army
point
of
view
had
for
all
these
staff
adjutants
to
whom
the
newcomer
obviously
belonged
rostov
felt
embarrassed
turned
red
and
fell
silent
boris
asked
what
was
the
news
at
the
staff
and
what
without
being
indiscreet
was
rumored
about
our
dispositions
theyll
probably
advance
bolkonsky
replied
clearly
not
wishing
to
say
more
in
front
of
strangers
berg
used
the
opportunity
to
ask
with
particular
courtesy
whether
as
rumor
had
it
company
commanders
were
now
to
draw
a
double
allotment
for
forage
to
which
prince
andrei
replied
with
a
smile
that
he
was
unable
to
opine
about
such
important
government
instructions
and
berg
laughed
joyfully
about
your
affair
prince
andrei
turned
to
boris
again
well
speak
later
and
he
glanced
at
rostov
come
to
me
after
the
review
well
do
all
thats
possible
and
glancing
around
the
room
he
turned
to
rostov
whose
state
of
uncontrollable
childish
embarrassment
turning
into
spite
he
did
not
deign
to
notice
and
said
it
seems
you
were
telling
about
the
sch246ngraben
action
were
you
there
i
was
there
rostov
said
spitefully
as
if
wishing
to
insult
the
adjutant
by
it
bolkonsky
noticed
the
hussars
state
and
found
it
amusing
he
gave
a
slightly
contemptuous
smile
yes
many
stories
are
told
now
about
that
action
yes
stories
rostov
began
speaking
loudly
glancing
now
at
boris
now
at
bolkonsky
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
furious
yes
many
stories
are
told
but
our
storiesthe
stories
of
those
who
were
there
right
under
enemy
fireour
stories
have
weight
not
the
stories
of
those
fellows
on
the
staff
who
get
rewards
for
doing
nothing
to
whom
you
suppose
that
i
belong
prince
andrei
said
calmly
and
with
an
especially
pleasant
smile
a
strange
feeling
of
spite
and
along
with
that
of
respect
for
the
calmness
of
this
figure
came
together
at
that
moment
in
rostovs
soul
im
not
talking
about
you
he
said
i
dont
know
you
and
i
confess
i
dont
wish
to
im
talking
about
the
staff
in
general
and
i
will
tell
you
this
prince
andrei
interrupted
him
with
calm
power
in
his
voice
you
want
to
insult
me
and
i
am
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
it
is
very
easy
to
do
so
if
you
lack
sufficient
respect
for
yourself
but
you
must
agree
that
the
time
and
place
have
been
rather
poorly
chosen
for
that
one
of
these
days
well
all
take
a
big
more
serious
duel
and
besides
that
drubetskoy
who
says
hes
your
old
friend
is
not
at
all
to
blame
for
the
fact
that
my
physiognomy
has
the
misfortune
not
to
please
you
however
he
said
getting
up
you
know
my
name
and
where
to
find
me
but
dont
forget
he
added
that
i
consider
neither
myself
nor
you
insulted
in
the
least
and
my
advice
as
an
older
man
is
to
let
this
matter
go
without
consequences
so
ill
be
waiting
for
you
on
friday
after
the
review
drubetskoy
goodbye
prince
andrei
concluded
and
left
after
bowing
to
them
both
rostov
remembered
what
reply
he
should
have
given
only
when
the
man
was
already
gone
and
he
was
the
more
angry
because
he
had
forgotten
to
say
it
rostov
ordered
his
horse
brought
at
once
and
having
drily
taken
leave
of
boris
rode
home
should
he
go
to
headquarters
tomorrow
and
challenge
this
mincing
adjutant
or
indeed
let
the
affair
go
at
that
this
was
the
question
that
tormented
him
all
the
way
now
he
thought
spitefully
of
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
see
this
small
weak
and
proud
mans
fear
in
the
face
of
his
pistol
then
he
was
surprised
to
feel
that
of
all
the
people
he
knew
there
was
no
one
he
so
wished
to
have
for
a
friend
as
this
hateful
little
adjutant
viii
on
the
day
after
the
meeting
of
boris
and
rostov
there
was
a
review
of
the
russian
and
austrian
troops
the
fresh
ones
come
from
russia
as
well
as
those
returned
from
campaigning
with
kutuzov
both
emperors
the
russian
with
his
heir
the
grand
duke
and
the
austrian
with
the
archduke
made
this
review
of
the
combined
eightythousandman
army
since
early
morning
the
trim
and
smartly
polished
troops
had
been
on
the
move
lining
up
in
the
field
in
front
of
the
fortress
now
thousands
of
feet
and
bayonets
moved
with
flying
standards
and
at
the
officers
command
halted
turned
and
lined
up
at
intervals
circling
around
other
similar
masses
of
infantry
in
different
uniforms
now
there
came
the
sounds
of
the
measured
thudding
and
clanking
of
the
dressedup
cavalry
in
blue
red
and
green
embroidered
uniforms
with
embroidered
musicians
in
front
on
black
chestnut
or
gray
horses
now
stretching
out
with
the
brazen
noise
of
polished
shining
cannon
shaking
on
their
carriages
and
with
their
smell
of
linstocks
the
artillery
crawled
between
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
settled
in
their
appointed
places
not
only
the
generals
in
full
parade
dress
their
waists
fat
or
slender
tightened
to
the
utmost
their
necks
reddened
by
highpropped
collars
wearing
sashes
and
all
their
decorations
not
only
the
pomaded
sprucedup
officers
but
every
soldier
his
face
freshly
scrubbed
and
shaven
his
equipment
polished
to
the
highest
shine
possible
and
every
horse
groomed
so
that
its
hide
gleamed
like
satin
its
wetted
mane
lying
hair
by
hairthey
all
felt
that
what
was
taking
place
was
earnest
significant
and
solemn
every
general
and
soldier
sensed
his
own
nullity
aware
of
being
a
grain
of
sand
in
this
sea
of
people
and
at
the
same
time
sensed
his
strength
aware
of
being
this
enormous
whole
from
early
morning
strenuous
bustling
and
efforts
had
begun
and
by
ten
oclock
everything
had
reached
the
required
order
the
ranks
were
drawn
up
on
the
enormous
field
the
entire
army
was
stretched
out
in
three
lines
in
the
front
the
cavalry
behind
them
the
artillery
further
behind
the
infantry
between
each
kind
of
troops
was
a
sort
of
street
the
three
parts
of
this
army
could
be
clearly
distinguished
from
each
other
kutuzovs
fighting
force
in
which
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
stood
on
the
right
flank
in
the
front
line
the
infantry
and
guards
regiments
come
from
russia
and
the
austrian
troops
but
they
all
stood
in
one
line
under
one
command
and
in
the
same
order
like
wind
in
the
leaves
an
excited
whisper
passed
theyre
coming
theyre
coming
frightened
voices
were
heard
and
the
bustle
of
final
preparations
rippled
through
the
troops
before
them
coming
from
olm252tz
a
moving
group
appeared
and
at
the
same
time
though
it
was
a
windless
day
a
light
current
of
wind
ran
through
the
army
and
barely
stirred
the
lance
pennants
and
slack
standards
which
began
to
flutter
against
their
staffs
it
seemed
the
army
itself
by
this
slight
movement
was
expressing
its
joy
at
the
approaching
sovereigns
a
single
voice
was
heard
attention
then
like
cocks
at
dawn
voices
repeated
it
from
all
ends
and
everything
became
still
in
the
deathly
silence
only
the
thud
of
hooves
could
be
heard
this
was
the
emperors
suite
the
sovereigns
rode
up
to
the
flanks
and
the
trumpets
of
the
first
cavalry
regiment
rang
out
playing
the
general
march
it
seemed
it
was
not
the
trumpeters
playing
but
the
army
itself
rejoicing
at
the
sovereigns
approach
that
naturally
produced
these
sounds
through
these
sounds
the
one
young
gentle
voice
of
the
emperor
alexander
was
distinctly
heard
he
uttered
a
greeting
and
the
first
regiment
bawled
out
such
a
deafening
prolonged
and
joyful
hurrah
that
the
men
themselves
were
awestruck
at
the
multitude
and
strength
of
the
huge
bulk
they
made
up
rostov
standing
in
the
front
ranks
of
kutuzovs
army
which
the
sovereign
rode
up
to
first
had
the
same
feeling
that
was
experienced
by
every
man
in
that
armya
feeling
of
selfforgetfulness
a
proud
awareness
of
strength
and
a
passionate
attraction
to
him
who
was
the
cause
of
this
solemnity
he
felt
that
it
would
take
only
one
word
from
this
man
for
that
whole
mass
and
he
himself
bound
up
with
itan
insignificant
speck
to
go
through
fire
and
water
to
crime
to
death
or
to
the
greatest
heroism
and
therefore
he
could
not
but
tremble
and
thrill
at
the
sight
of
that
approaching
word
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
thundered
on
all
sides
and
one
regiment
after
another
received
the
sovereign
to
the
strains
of
the
general
march
then
hurrah
and
the
general
march
and
again
hurrah
and
hurrahwhich
ever
growing
and
swelling
merged
into
a
deafening
roar
before
the
approach
of
the
sovereign
each
regiment
in
its
speechlessness
and
immobility
seemed
a
lifeless
body
but
as
soon
as
the
sovereign
drew
level
with
it
the
regiment
came
alive
and
thundered
joining
the
roar
of
the
entire
line
which
the
sovereign
had
already
passed
to
the
terrible
deafening
sound
of
these
voices
amidst
the
masses
of
troops
motionless
as
if
petrified
in
their
rectangles
the
hundreds
of
horsemen
of
the
suite
moved
casually
asymmetrically
and
above
all
freely
and
in
front
of
them
two
menthe
emperors
upon
them
was
concentrated
the
restrainedly
passionate
undivided
attention
of
this
entire
mass
of
men
the
handsome
young
emperor
alexander
in
the
uniform
of
the
horse
guards
in
a
triangular
hat
worn
brim
first
with
his
pleasant
face
and
sonorous
but
not
loud
voice
attracted
the
full
force
of
attention
rostov
stood
not
far
from
the
trumpeters
and
with
his
keensighted
eyes
he
recognized
the
sovereign
from
afar
and
followed
his
approach
when
the
sovereign
had
approached
to
within
twenty
paces
and
nikolai
could
make
out
clearly
in
all
its
details
the
handsome
young
and
happy
face
of
the
emperor
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
rapture
such
as
he
had
never
experienced
before
every
feature
every
movement
of
the
sovereign
seemed
lovely
to
him
having
stopped
facing
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
the
sovereign
said
something
in
french
to
the
austrian
emperor
and
smiled
seeing
that
smile
rostov
involuntarily
began
to
smile
himself
and
felt
a
still
stronger
surge
of
love
for
his
sovereign
he
wanted
to
show
his
love
for
the
sovereign
in
some
way
he
knew
that
this
was
impossible
and
wanted
to
cry
the
sovereign
summoned
the
regimental
commander
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
my
god
what
would
happen
to
me
if
the
sovereign
addressed
me
thought
rostov
id
die
of
happiness
the
sovereign
also
addressed
the
officers
i
thank
you
all
gentlemen
every
word
rostov
heard
was
like
a
sound
from
heaven
with
all
my
heart
how
happy
rostov
would
be
if
he
could
die
now
for
his
sovereign
you
have
merited
the
st
george
standards
and
will
be
worthy
of
them
just
to
die
to
die
for
him
thought
rostov
the
sovereign
said
something
more
which
rostov
did
not
hear
and
the
soldiers
straining
their
chests
shouted
hurrah
rostov
also
shouted
with
all
his
might
leaning
towards
his
saddle
wishing
to
hurt
himself
with
this
cry
only
so
as
to
express
fully
his
rapture
for
the
sovereign
the
sovereign
stood
for
a
few
seconds
facing
the
hussars
as
if
undecided
how
can
a
sovereign
be
undecided
thought
rostov
and
then
even
this
indecision
seemed
majestic
and
enchanting
to
rostov
like
everything
the
sovereign
did
the
sovereigns
indecision
lasted
only
a
moment
the
sovereigns
foot
in
the
narrow
sharp
toe
of
its
boot
as
they
wore
them
then
touched
the
belly
of
the
bobtailed
bay
mare
he
was
riding
the
sovereigns
hand
in
its
white
glove
picked
up
the
reins
and
he
set
off
accompanied
by
a
disorderly
swaying
sea
of
adjutants
he
rode
further
and
further
stopping
by
other
regiments
and
at
last
rostov
could
only
see
his
white
plumes
beyond
the
suite
that
surrounded
the
emperors
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
rostov
noticed
bolkonsky
sitting
his
horse
lazily
and
casually
rostov
remembered
his
quarrel
with
him
yesterday
and
the
question
arose
whether
he
should
or
should
not
challenge
him
of
course
not
rostov
thought
nowand
is
it
worth
thinking
and
talking
about
it
at
a
moment
like
this
at
a
moment
of
such
a
feeling
of
love
rapture
and
selfdenialwhat
are
all
our
quarrels
and
offenses
i
love
everybody
i
forgive
everybody
now
thought
rostov
when
the
sovereign
had
ridden
by
almost
all
the
regiments
the
troops
began
a
ceremonial
march
past
him
and
rostov
on
bedouin
newly
purchased
from
denisov
rode
at
the
tail
end
of
his
squadronthat
is
alone
and
in
full
view
of
the
sovereign
before
he
reached
the
sovereign
rostov
an
excellent
horseman
twice
put
the
spurs
to
his
bedouin
and
happily
brought
him
to
that
furiouspaced
trot
which
bedouin
was
prone
to
when
excited
lowering
his
foaming
muzzle
to
his
chest
his
tail
extended
and
as
if
flying
through
the
air
without
touching
the
ground
gracefully
lifting
his
legs
high
as
he
shifted
them
bedouin
who
also
felt
the
sovereigns
gaze
upon
him
passed
by
superbly
rostov
himself
flinging
his
legs
back
drawing
his
stomach
in
and
feeling
himself
one
piece
with
his
horse
with
a
frowning
but
blissful
face
like
the
very
devil
as
denisov
used
to
say
rode
past
the
sovereign
bravo
pavlogradskies
said
the
sovereign
my
god
how
happy
id
be
if
he
ordered
me
right
now
to
throw
myself
into
the
fire
thought
rostov
when
the
review
was
over
the
officers
both
the
newly
arrived
and
kutuzovs
began
to
gather
in
groups
and
talk
sprang
up
about
rewards
about
the
austrians
and
their
uniforms
about
their
front
about
bonaparte
and
how
bad
things
were
going
to
be
for
him
now
especially
when
the
corps
from
essen
also
arrives
and
prussia
takes
our
side
but
most
of
all
in
all
circles
they
talked
about
the
sovereign
alexander
repeating
his
every
word
and
movement
and
admiring
him
they
all
wished
for
only
one
thing
to
go
quickly
against
the
enemy
under
the
sovereigns
leadership
under
the
command
of
the
sovereign
himself
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
defeat
anyone
whateverso
thought
rostov
and
most
of
the
officers
after
the
review
there
was
greater
assurance
of
victory
than
there
might
have
been
after
two
victorious
battles
ix
the
day
after
the
review
boris
putting
on
his
best
uniform
and
with
parting
wishes
of
success
from
his
comrade
berg
rode
to
see
bolkonsky
in
olm252tz
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
his
friendliness
and
arrange
the
best
position
for
himself
in
particular
the
position
of
adjutant
to
an
important
person
which
seemed
to
him
particularly
attractive
in
the
army
its
all
right
for
rostov
whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
roubles
at
a
time
to
talk
about
how
he
doesnt
want
to
bow
to
anybody
or
be
anybodys
lackey
but
i
who
have
nothing
except
my
own
head
must
make
my
career
and
not
let
chances
slip
but
avail
myself
of
them
he
did
not
find
prince
andrei
in
olm252tz
that
day
but
the
sight
of
olm252tz
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
and
both
emperors
lived
with
their
suites
of
courtiers
and
attendants
increased
still
more
his
desire
to
belong
to
that
supreme
world
he
knew
nobody
and
despite
his
dashing
guardsmans
uniform
all
these
higher
people
going
up
and
down
the
streets
in
dashing
carriages
plumes
ribbons
and
decorations
courtiers
and
military
seemed
to
stand
so
immeasurably
higher
than
he
a
little
officer
of
the
guards
that
they
not
only
did
not
want
to
but
even
could
not
recognize
his
existence
in
the
quarters
of
the
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
where
he
asked
for
bolkonsky
all
these
adjutants
and
even
orderlies
looked
at
him
as
if
wishing
to
impress
upon
him
that
quite
a
few
officers
such
as
he
hung
around
there
and
that
they
were
all
quite
sick
of
it
despite
that
or
rather
because
of
it
the
next
day
the
fifteenth
after
dinner
he
went
to
olm252tz
again
and
going
into
the
house
occupied
by
kutuzov
asked
for
bolkonsky
prince
andrei
was
at
home
and
boris
was
taken
to
a
large
hall
which
probably
had
once
been
used
for
dancing
and
now
was
filled
with
five
beds
and
various
furnishings
tables
chairs
and
a
pianoforte
one
adjutant
closer
to
the
door
in
a
persian
dressing
gown
was
sitting
at
a
table
and
writing
a
second
the
red
fat
nesvitsky
was
lying
on
a
bed
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
laughing
along
with
another
officer
who
was
sitting
with
him
a
third
was
playing
a
viennese
waltz
on
the
pianoforte
a
fourth
was
lying
on
the
pianoforte
and
singing
along
bolkonsky
was
not
there
none
of
these
gentlemen
changed
his
position
on
noticing
boris
the
one
who
was
writing
and
whom
boris
addressed
turned
to
him
vexedly
and
told
him
that
bolkonsky
was
on
duty
and
that
if
he
wanted
to
see
him
he
should
go
through
the
door
on
the
left
to
the
reception
room
boris
thanked
him
and
went
into
the
reception
room
in
the
reception
room
there
were
some
ten
officers
and
generals
just
as
boris
came
in
prince
andrei
narrowing
his
eyes
disdainfully
with
that
particular
air
of
polite
weariness
which
says
clearly
that
were
it
not
my
duty
i
would
not
talk
with
you
for
a
minute
was
listening
to
an
old
russian
general
with
decorations
who
drawn
up
almost
on
tiptoe
with
an
obsequious
soldierly
expression
on
his
purple
face
was
reporting
something
to
him
very
well
be
so
good
as
to
wait
he
said
to
the
general
in
russian
with
that
french
pronunciation
which
he
used
when
he
wanted
to
speak
disdainfully
and
noticing
boris
and
no
longer
addressing
the
general
who
pleadingly
ran
after
him
asking
to
be
heard
out
prince
andrei
turned
to
boris
with
a
cheerful
smile
nodding
to
him
boris
clearly
understood
at
that
moment
what
he
had
foreseen
earlier
namely
that
in
the
army
besides
the
subordination
and
discipline
that
were
written
in
the
regulations
and
known
to
the
regiment
and
which
he
knew
there
was
another
more
essential
subordination
which
made
this
tightly
girded
purplefaced
general
wait
deferentially
while
the
captain
prince
andrei
for
his
own
pleasure
found
it
preferable
to
talk
with
the
ensign
drubetskoy
boris
resolved
more
than
ever
to
serve
in
the
future
according
to
this
unwritten
subordination
not
the
one
written
in
the
regulations
he
now
felt
that
merely
as
the
result
of
his
having
been
recommended
to
prince
andrei
he
had
at
once
become
higher
than
the
general
who
on
other
occasions
at
the
front
could
annihilate
an
ensign
of
the
guards
like
him
prince
andrei
went
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
very
sorry
you
didnt
find
me
in
yesterday
i
spent
the
whole
day
fussing
about
with
the
germans
went
to
see
weyrother
to
check
the
disposition
when
germans
start
being
accurate
theres
no
end
to
it
boris
smiled
as
if
he
understood
what
prince
andrei
was
hinting
at
as
common
knowledge
but
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
the
name
of
weyrother
and
even
the
word
disposition
well
what
is
it
my
friend
do
you
still
want
to
be
an
adjutant
ive
been
thinking
about
you
meanwhile
yes
said
boris
blushing
involuntarily
for
some
reason
i
thought
of
asking
the
commander
in
chief
he
received
a
letter
about
me
from
prince
kuragin
i
wanted
to
ask
he
added
as
if
apologizing
because
im
afraid
the
guards
wont
see
action
very
good
very
good
well
discuss
it
all
said
prince
andrei
just
let
me
report
about
this
gentleman
and
then
im
yours
while
prince
andrei
went
to
report
about
the
purple
general
that
general
who
obviously
did
not
share
boriss
notions
about
the
advantages
of
the
unwritten
subordination
so
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
insolent
ensign
who
had
prevented
him
from
finishing
his
talk
with
the
adjutant
that
boris
felt
awkward
he
turned
away
and
waited
impatiently
for
prince
andrei
to
come
back
from
the
commander
in
chiefs
office
you
see
my
friend
ive
been
thinking
about
you
said
prince
andrei
when
they
came
to
the
big
room
with
the
pianoforte
theres
no
point
in
your
going
to
the
commander
in
chief
said
prince
andrei
hell
tell
you
a
heap
of
nice
things
ask
you
to
dinner
that
wouldnt
be
so
bad
for
service
by
the
other
subordination
thought
boris
but
nothing
further
will
come
of
it
there
will
soon
be
a
battalion
of
us
adjutants
and
orderly
officers
but
heres
what
well
do
i
have
a
good
friend
an
adjutant
general
and
a
wonderful
man
prince
dolgorukov
and
though
you
couldnt
know
this
the
thing
is
that
kutuzov
and
his
staff
and
all
of
us
mean
precisely
nothing
everything
is
now
concentrated
on
the
sovereign
so
lets
go
to
dolgorukov
i
have
to
go
to
him
anyway
and
ive
already
spoken
to
him
about
you
so
well
see
whether
he
cant
find
it
possible
to
set
you
up
with
him
or
somewhere
else
closer
to
the
sun
prince
andrei
always
became
especially
animated
when
he
had
to
guide
a
young
man
and
help
him
towards
worldly
success
under
the
pretext
of
this
help
for
another
which
out
of
pride
he
would
never
accept
for
himself
he
found
himself
close
to
the
milieu
which
conferred
success
and
which
attracted
him
he
took
up
boris
quite
willingly
and
went
with
him
to
prince
dolgorukov
it
was
already
late
in
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
olm252tz
palace
which
was
occupied
by
the
emperors
and
their
retinues
on
that
same
day
there
had
been
a
council
of
war
in
which
all
the
members
of
the
hofkriegsrath
and
both
emperors
took
part
at
the
council
in
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
the
old
menkutuzov
and
prince
schwarzenbergit
was
decided
to
go
on
the
offensive
immediately
and
give
general
battle
to
bonaparte
the
council
of
war
had
just
ended
when
prince
andrei
accompanied
by
boris
came
to
the
palace
to
look
for
prince
dolgorukov
the
headquarters
personnel
were
all
still
under
the
charm
of
that
days
council
of
war
which
had
been
victorious
for
the
younger
party
the
voices
of
the
footdraggers
who
advised
waiting
for
something
else
and
not
going
on
the
offensive
had
been
so
unanimously
stifled
and
their
arguments
refuted
by
the
indubitable
proofs
of
the
advantages
of
an
offensive
that
what
was
talked
about
at
the
councilthe
future
battle
and
undoubted
victoryseemed
no
longer
future
but
past
all
the
advantages
were
on
our
side
enormous
forces
undoubtedly
superior
to
napoleons
were
massed
in
one
place
the
troops
were
inspired
by
the
presence
of
the
emperors
and
straining
for
action
the
strategic
point
at
which
they
were
to
act
was
known
in
the
smallest
detail
to
the
austrian
general
weyrother
who
was
leading
the
army
as
if
by
a
lucky
chance
the
austrian
troops
had
been
on
maneuvers
a
year
before
precisely
on
the
fields
where
they
were
now
to
fight
the
french
the
lay
of
the
land
was
known
and
mapped
in
the
smallest
detail
and
bonaparte
obviously
weakened
was
undertaking
nothing
dolgorukov
one
of
the
most
fervent
advocates
of
the
offensive
had
just
come
back
from
the
council
weary
exhausted
but
animated
and
proud
of
the
victory
won
prince
andrei
introduced
the
officer
he
was
patronizing
but
prince
dolgorukov
giving
him
a
polite
and
firm
handshake
said
nothing
to
boris
and
obviously
unable
to
keep
from
speaking
out
the
thoughts
that
occupied
him
most
at
that
moment
addressed
prince
andrei
in
french
well
my
friend
what
a
battle
we
went
through
god
only
grant
that
the
one
that
results
from
it
is
as
victorious
however
my
dear
he
spoke
haltingly
and
animatedly
i
must
confess
my
guilt
before
the
austrians
and
especially
before
weyrother
what
precision
what
detail
what
knowledge
of
the
terrain
what
foresight
of
all
possibilities
all
conditions
all
the
smallest
details
no
my
dear
more
advantageous
conditions
than
those
we
find
ourselves
in
could
not
be
purposely
invented
the
combination
of
austrian
clarity
with
russian
couragewhat
more
do
you
want
so
the
offensive
is
definitely
decided
upon
asked
bolkonsky
and
you
know
my
friend
it
seems
to
me
that
bonaparte
has
decidedly
lost
his
latin
you
know
a
letter
to
the
emperor
came
from
him
today
dolgorukov
smiled
significantly
well
now
what
does
he
write
asked
bolkonsky
what
can
he
write
faldididdleda
and
the
like
all
only
with
the
purpose
of
gaining
time
i
tell
you
hes
in
our
hands
thats
certain
but
the
most
amusing
thing
he
said
suddenly
laughing
goodnaturedly
is
that
we
simply
couldnt
decide
how
to
address
the
reply
if
not
as
consul
and
naturally
not
as
emperor
then
as
general
buonaparte
it
seemed
to
me
but
theres
a
difference
between
not
acknowledging
him
as
emperor
and
calling
him
general
buonaparte
said
bolkonsky
thats
just
it
dolgorukov
interrupted
laughing
and
speaking
quickly
you
know
bilibin
hes
a
very
intelligent
man
he
suggested
addressing
him
as
usurper
and
enemy
of
the
human
race
dolgorukov
burst
into
merry
laughter
no
more
than
that
remarked
bolkonsky
but
anyhow
bilibin
found
a
serious
title
of
address
a
witty
and
intelligent
man
what
is
it
to
the
head
of
the
french
government
au
chef
du
gouvernement
fran231ais
dolgorukov
said
seriously
and
with
satisfaction
its
good
isnt
it
its
good
but
hell
dislike
it
very
much
remarked
bolkonsky
oh
very
much
my
brother
knows
him
he
dined
with
him
the
present
emperor
more
than
once
in
paris
and
he
told
me
that
he
never
saw
a
more
subtle
and
clever
diplomatyou
know
a
combination
of
french
adroitness
and
italian
playacting
do
you
know
the
anecdotes
about
him
and
count
mark243v
count
mark243v
was
the
only
one
who
knew
how
to
handle
him
do
you
know
the
story
of
the
handkerchief
its
charming
and
the
loquacious
dolgorukov
turning
now
to
boris
now
to
prince
andrei
told
how
bonaparte
wishing
to
test
mark243v
our
ambassador
purposely
dropped
his
handkerchief
in
front
of
him
and
stood
there
looking
at
him
probably
expecting
a
service
from
mark243v
and
how
mark243v
at
once
dropped
his
own
handkerchief
next
to
it
and
picked
it
up
without
picking
up
bonapartes
handkerchief
charmant
said
bolkonsky
but
the
thing
is
prince
that
ive
come
to
solicit
you
for
this
young
man
you
see
but
before
prince
andrei
finished
an
adjutant
came
into
the
room
to
summon
prince
dolgorukov
to
the
emperor
ah
how
vexing
said
dolgorukov
hurriedly
getting
up
and
shaking
hands
with
prince
andrei
and
boris
you
know
ill
be
very
glad
to
do
everything
in
my
power
both
for
you
and
for
this
nice
young
man
he
shook
boriss
hand
once
more
with
an
expression
of
goodnatured
sincere
and
animated
lightmindedness
but
you
seetill
next
time
boris
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
the
closeness
to
supreme
power
in
which
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
that
moment
he
was
conscious
of
himself
being
in
touch
with
the
springs
that
controlled
all
those
huge
mass
movements
of
which
he
in
his
regiment
felt
himself
a
small
submissive
and
insignificant
part
they
followed
prince
dolgorukov
to
the
corridor
and
met
coming
out
of
the
door
to
the
sovereigns
room
by
which
dolgorukov
went
in
a
short
man
in
civilian
clothes
with
an
intelligent
face
and
a
distinctive
sharply
protruding
jaw
which
without
spoiling
his
looks
endowed
him
with
a
particular
liveliness
and
shiftiness
of
expression
this
short
man
gave
the
nod
of
a
close
acquaintance
to
dolgorukov
and
began
peering
at
prince
andrei
with
an
intently
cold
gaze
walking
straight
at
him
and
clearly
expecting
prince
andrei
to
greet
him
or
give
way
to
him
prince
andrei
did
neither
his
face
expressed
spite
and
the
young
man
turning
away
went
down
the
side
of
the
corridor
whos
that
asked
boris
that
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
for
me
most
unpleasant
of
men
that
is
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
prince
adam
czartoryski
its
these
people
bolkonsky
said
with
a
sigh
which
he
could
not
suppress
as
they
were
leaving
the
palace
its
these
people
who
decide
the
fates
of
nations
the
next
day
the
troops
set
out
on
the
march
and
boris
had
no
time
up
to
the
battle
of
austerlitz
itself
to
visit
either
bolkonsky
or
dolgorukov
and
remained
for
a
time
with
the
izmailovsky
regiment
x
at
dawn
on
the
sixteenth
denisovs
squadron
in
which
nikolai
rostov
served
and
which
was
in
bagrations
detachment
moved
from
its
night
lodgings
into
action
as
they
said
and
having
gone
about
half
a
mile
behind
other
columns
halted
on
the
high
road
rostov
saw
the
cossacks
go
past
him
the
first
and
second
squadrons
of
hussars
the
infantry
battalions
with
the
artillery
and
then
generals
bagration
and
dolgorukov
rode
past
with
their
adjutants
all
the
fear
which
as
previously
he
experienced
before
action
all
the
inner
struggle
by
means
of
which
he
overcame
that
fear
all
his
dreams
of
how
he
would
distinguish
himself
as
a
fine
hussar
in
this
actionwent
for
naught
their
squadron
was
kept
in
reserve
and
nikolai
rostov
spent
that
day
feeling
bored
and
melancholy
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
morning
he
heard
gunfire
ahead
of
him
shouts
of
hurrah
saw
some
wounded
brought
back
they
were
not
many
and
finally
saw
a
whole
detachment
of
french
cavalry
led
along
in
the
midst
of
a
cossack
hundred
obviously
the
action
was
over
and
the
action
had
obviously
been
not
big
but
successful
the
soldiers
and
officers
coming
back
told
of
a
brilliant
victory
of
the
taking
of
the
town
of
wischau
and
the
capture
of
a
whole
french
squadron
the
day
was
clear
sunny
after
a
heavy
night
frost
and
the
cheerful
brightness
of
the
fall
day
coincided
with
the
news
of
the
victory
which
was
reported
not
only
by
those
who
took
it
but
also
by
the
joyful
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
soldiers
officers
generals
and
adjutants
who
went
there
and
came
back
past
rostov
the
more
wrung
was
rostovs
heart
who
had
uselessly
suffered
all
the
fear
that
precedes
a
battle
and
had
spent
this
cheerful
day
in
inaction
rostov
come
here
lets
drink
from
rief
shouted
denisov
sitting
down
by
the
edge
of
the
road
in
front
of
a
flask
and
some
food
the
officers
gathered
in
a
circle
eating
and
talking
around
denisovs
mess
kit
here
they
come
with
another
one
said
one
of
the
officers
pointing
to
a
captured
french
dragoon
whom
two
cossacks
were
leading
along
on
foot
one
of
them
was
leading
by
the
bridle
the
captives
tall
and
beautiful
french
horse
sell
me
the
horse
denisov
shouted
to
the
cossack
if
you
like
your
honor
the
officers
stood
up
and
surrounded
the
cossacks
and
the
captured
frenchman
the
french
dragoon
was
a
young
fellow
an
alsatian
who
spoke
french
with
a
german
accent
he
was
breathless
with
agitation
his
face
was
red
and
hearing
some
words
of
french
he
began
speaking
quickly
to
the
officers
addressing
now
one
now
another
he
said
that
he
would
not
have
been
taken
that
it
was
not
his
fault
that
he
was
taken
but
that
of
le
caporal
who
had
sent
him
to
fetch
the
horsecloths
that
he
had
told
him
the
russians
were
already
there
and
to
everything
he
said
he
added
mais
quon
ne
fasse
pas
de
mal
224
mon
petit
cheval
and
caressed
his
horse
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
quite
understand
where
he
was
he
now
apologized
for
being
taken
now
supposing
he
was
facing
his
superiors
displayed
his
soldierly
punctiliousness
and
zeal
for
service
he
brought
with
him
to
our
rear
guard
all
the
freshness
of
atmosphere
of
the
french
troops
which
was
so
foreign
to
us
the
cossacks
let
the
horse
go
for
two
gold
pieces
and
rostov
who
now
having
received
money
was
the
richest
of
the
officers
bought
it
mais
quon
ne
fasse
pas
de
mal
224
mon
petit
cheval
the
alsatian
said
goodnaturedly
to
rostov
when
the
horse
was
handed
over
to
the
hussar
rostov
smiling
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
some
money
allee
allee
said
the
cossack
touching
the
prisoners
arm
to
urge
him
on
the
sovereign
the
sovereign
was
suddenly
heard
among
the
hussars
everyone
began
running
hurrying
and
rostov
saw
behind
him
on
the
road
several
horsemen
with
white
plumes
in
their
hats
riding
up
in
a
single
moment
everyone
was
in
his
place
and
waiting
rostov
did
not
remember
and
did
not
feel
how
he
ran
to
his
place
and
mounted
his
horse
his
regret
over
his
nonparticipation
in
the
action
his
humdrum
mood
in
the
circle
of
usual
faces
instantly
went
away
and
all
thought
of
himself
instantly
vanished
he
was
wholly
consumed
by
the
feeling
of
happiness
that
came
from
the
nearness
of
the
sovereign
he
felt
himself
rewarded
by
this
nearness
alone
for
the
loss
of
that
day
he
was
as
happy
as
a
lover
who
has
obtained
a
hopedfor
rendezvous
not
daring
to
turn
to
look
while
in
line
and
not
looking
his
rapturous
senses
felt
his
approach
and
he
felt
it
not
only
from
the
hoofbeats
of
the
approaching
cavalcade
but
felt
it
because
as
it
approached
everything
around
him
became
brighter
more
joyful
more
significant
and
more
festive
this
sun
moved
ever
nearer
and
nearer
to
rostov
spreading
around
itself
rays
of
mild
and
majestic
light
and
he
already
feels
himself
caught
up
in
those
rays
he
hears
his
voicethat
gentle
calm
majestic
and
at
the
same
time
so
simple
voice
as
it
had
to
be
according
to
rostovs
feeling
a
deathly
silence
ensued
and
in
that
silence
the
sounds
of
the
sovereigns
voice
rang
out
les
hussards
de
pavlograd
he
said
questioningly
la
r233serve
sire
someones
voice
replied
so
human
after
the
nonhuman
voice
that
had
said
les
hussards
de
pavlograd
the
sovereign
drew
even
with
rostov
and
stopped
alexanders
face
was
still
more
beautiful
than
three
days
before
at
the
review
it
shone
with
such
cheer
and
youth
such
innocent
youth
that
it
reminded
one
of
a
boyish
fourteenyearold
friskiness
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
still
the
face
of
a
majestic
emperor
looking
the
squadron
over
at
random
the
sovereigns
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
rostov
and
rested
on
them
for
no
more
than
two
seconds
the
sovereign
may
or
may
not
have
understood
everything
that
was
going
on
in
rostovs
soul
it
seemed
to
rostov
that
he
had
understood
everything
but
for
about
two
seconds
he
looked
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
into
rostovs
face
a
soft
mild
light
poured
from
them
then
he
suddenly
raised
his
eyebrows
spurred
his
horse
with
a
sharp
movement
of
his
left
foot
and
rode
on
at
a
gallop
on
hearing
gunfire
in
the
vanguard
the
young
emperor
could
not
restrain
his
desire
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
despite
all
the
remonstrations
of
his
courtiers
at
noon
having
separated
from
the
third
column
with
which
he
was
proceeding
he
rode
to
the
vanguard
before
he
reached
the
hussars
several
adjutants
met
him
with
news
of
the
successful
outcome
of
the
action
the
battle
which
consisted
merely
in
the
capture
of
a
french
squadron
was
presented
as
a
brilliant
victory
over
the
french
and
therefore
the
sovereign
and
the
whole
army
especially
while
the
powder
smoke
still
hung
over
the
battlefield
believed
that
the
french
were
defeated
and
were
retreating
against
their
will
a
few
minutes
after
the
sovereign
rode
by
the
pavlogradsky
division
was
ordered
to
advance
in
wischau
itself
a
small
german
town
rostov
saw
the
sovereign
once
more
on
the
town
square
where
a
rather
intense
exchange
of
gunfire
had
taken
place
before
the
sovereigns
arrival
lay
several
dead
and
wounded
men
whom
there
had
been
no
time
to
pick
up
the
sovereign
surrounded
by
his
suite
of
military
and
nonmilitary
men
was
on
a
bobtailed
chestnut
mare
already
different
from
the
one
at
the
review
and
leaning
to
one
side
holding
a
gold
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
with
a
graceful
gesture
was
looking
through
it
at
a
soldier
who
lay
facedown
without
his
shako
his
head
bloody
the
wounded
soldier
was
so
dirty
coarse
and
vile
that
rostov
was
offended
by
his
nearness
to
the
sovereign
rostov
saw
how
the
sovereigns
stooping
shoulders
shuddered
as
if
a
chill
ran
through
them
and
how
his
left
foot
convulsively
began
to
spur
the
horses
side
the
welltrained
horse
looked
about
indifferently
and
did
not
stir
from
its
place
getting
off
their
horses
some
adjutants
took
the
soldier
under
the
arms
and
began
laying
him
on
a
stretcher
which
had
just
appeared
the
soldier
groaned
gently
gently
cant
you
do
it
gently
said
the
sovereign
clearly
suffering
more
than
the
dying
soldier
and
he
rode
off
rostov
saw
the
tears
that
filled
the
sovereigns
eyes
and
heard
him
say
in
french
to
czartoryski
as
he
rode
off
what
a
terrible
thing
war
is
what
a
terrible
thing
quel
terrible
chose
que
la
guerre
the
troops
of
the
vanguard
were
positioned
before
wischau
within
sight
of
the
enemy
line
which
yielded
ground
to
us
throughout
the
day
at
the
least
exchange
of
fire
the
sovereigns
gratitude
was
announced
to
the
vanguard
with
a
promise
of
rewards
and
the
men
were
given
a
double
ration
of
vodka
the
bivouac
fires
crackled
and
the
soldiers
songs
rang
out
still
more
merrily
than
the
previous
night
denisov
celebrated
his
promotion
to
major
that
night
and
rostov
who
had
already
drunk
quite
a
bit
proposed
a
toast
at
the
end
of
the
party
to
the
health
of
the
sovereign
but
not
of
the
sovereign
emperor
as
they
say
at
official
dinners
he
said
but
to
the
health
of
the
sovereign
that
kind
enchanting
and
great
man
we
drink
to
his
health
and
to
certain
victory
over
the
french
if
we
fought
before
he
said
and
gave
no
quarter
to
the
french
as
at
sch246ngraben
how
will
it
be
now
when
he
himself
is
at
our
head
well
all
die
well
gladly
die
for
him
right
gentlemen
maybe
im
not
speaking
well
ive
drunk
a
lot
but
thats
how
i
feel
and
so
do
you
to
the
health
of
alexander
the
first
hurrah
hurrah
rang
out
the
enthusiastic
voices
of
the
officers
and
old
captain
kirsten
shouted
enthusiastically
and
no
less
sincerely
than
the
twentyyearold
rostov
when
the
officers
drank
up
and
smashed
their
glasses
kirsten
filled
others
and
in
nothing
but
his
shirt
and
breeches
with
the
glass
in
his
hand
went
up
to
the
soldiers
campfires
struck
a
majestic
pose
with
his
long
gray
mustache
his
white
chest
showing
through
his
unbuttoned
shirt
stood
in
the
firelight
and
swung
his
arm
up
lads
to
the
health
of
the
sovereign
emperor
to
victory
over
our
foes
hurrah
he
cried
in
his
dashing
old
hussars
baritone
the
hussars
clustered
around
him
and
responded
all
together
in
a
loud
shout
late
that
night
when
everyone
had
dispersed
denisov
with
his
short
hand
patted
his
favorite
rostov
on
the
shoulder
theres
nobody
to
fall
in
love
with
on
campaign
so
hes
fallen
in
love
with
the
tsar
he
said
dont
joke
about
that
denisov
cried
rostov
this
is
such
a
lofty
such
a
beautiful
feeling
such
a
i
believe
it
my
friend
i
believe
it
and
i
share
it
and
approve
no
you
dont
understand
and
rostov
got
up
and
began
wandering
among
the
campfires
dreaming
of
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
die
not
saving
the
life
he
dared
not
even
dream
of
that
but
simply
to
die
before
the
eyes
of
the
sovereign
he
was
indeed
in
love
with
the
tsar
and
with
the
glory
of
russian
arms
and
with
the
hope
of
the
future
triumph
and
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
experienced
that
feeling
in
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
of
austerlitz
nine
tenths
of
the
men
in
the
russian
army
were
then
in
love
though
less
rapturously
with
their
tsar
and
with
the
glory
of
russian
arms
xi
the
next
day
the
sovereign
stayed
at
wischau
the
court
physician
villiers
was
summoned
to
him
several
times
in
headquarters
and
among
the
nearby
troops
the
news
spread
that
the
sovereign
was
unwell
he
had
eaten
nothing
and
slept
poorly
that
night
as
people
close
to
him
said
the
cause
of
it
was
the
strong
impression
made
on
the
sovereigns
sensitive
soul
by
the
sight
of
the
wounded
and
dead
at
dawn
on
the
seventeenth
a
french
officer
was
sent
to
wischau
from
our
outposts
who
had
come
under
a
flag
of
truce
asking
for
a
meeting
with
the
russian
emperor
this
officer
was
savary
the
sovereign
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
and
therefore
savary
had
to
wait
at
noon
he
was
admitted
to
the
sovereign
and
an
hour
later
he
rode
with
prince
dolgorukov
to
the
outposts
of
the
french
army
as
rumor
had
it
the
purpose
of
sending
savary
was
to
propose
peace
and
to
propose
a
meeting
between
the
emperor
alexander
and
napoleon
a
personal
meeting
to
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
whole
army
was
refused
and
instead
of
the
sovereign
prince
dolgorukov
the
victor
at
wischau
was
sent
with
savary
to
negotiate
with
napoleon
on
the
chance
that
these
negotiations
contrary
to
expectation
had
as
their
purpose
a
real
desire
for
peace
in
the
evening
dolgorukov
came
back
went
straight
to
the
sovereign
and
spent
a
long
time
alone
with
him
on
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
of
november
the
troops
made
two
more
marches
forward
and
the
enemys
outposts
retreated
after
brief
exchanges
of
fire
in
the
highest
spheres
of
the
army
an
intense
bustlingly
agitated
movement
began
from
noon
of
the
nineteenth
continuing
until
the
morning
of
the
next
day
the
twentieth
of
november
when
the
memorable
battle
of
austerlitz
took
place
until
noon
on
the
nineteenth
the
movement
animated
conversation
running
and
sending
of
adjutants
were
limited
to
the
emperors
headquarters
after
noon
of
the
same
day
the
movement
spread
to
the
headquarters
of
kutuzov
and
the
staffs
of
the
leaders
of
columns
by
evening
this
movement
had
spread
through
adjutants
to
all
ends
and
parts
of
the
army
and
during
the
night
of
the
nineteenth
to
the
twentieth
rising
up
from
its
night
camp
humming
with
talk
the
eightythousandman
mass
of
the
allied
army
undulated
and
set
off
in
a
huge
sixmile
sheet
the
concentrated
movement
which
began
that
morning
in
the
emperors
headquarters
and
gave
a
push
to
all
subsequent
movement
was
like
the
first
movement
of
the
central
wheel
in
a
big
tower
clock
slowly
one
wheel
started
another
turned
a
third
and
the
wheels
pulleys
and
gears
were
set
turning
more
and
more
quickly
chimes
began
to
ring
figures
popped
out
and
the
clock
hands
started
their
measured
advance
showing
the
result
of
that
movement
as
in
the
mechanism
of
a
clock
so
also
in
the
mechanism
of
military
action
the
movement
once
given
is
just
as
irrepressible
until
the
final
results
and
just
as
indifferently
motionless
are
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
not
yet
involved
in
the
action
even
a
moment
before
movement
is
transmitted
to
them
wheels
whizz
on
their
axles
cogs
catch
fastspinning
pulleys
whirr
yet
the
neighboring
wheel
is
as
calm
and
immobile
as
though
it
was
ready
to
stand
for
a
hundred
years
in
that
immobility
but
a
moment
comesthe
lever
catches
and
obedient
to
its
movement
the
wheel
creaks
turning
and
merges
into
one
movement
with
the
whole
the
result
and
purpose
of
which
are
incomprehensible
to
it
as
in
a
clock
the
result
of
the
complex
movement
of
numberless
wheels
and
pulleys
is
merely
the
slow
and
measured
movement
of
the
hands
pointing
to
the
time
so
also
the
result
of
all
the
complex
human
movements
of
these
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
russians
and
frenchall
the
passions
desires
regrets
humiliations
sufferings
bursts
of
pride
fear
rapturewas
merely
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
socalled
battle
of
the
three
emperors
that
is
a
slow
movement
of
the
worldhistorical
hand
on
the
clockface
of
human
history
prince
andrei
was
on
duty
that
day
and
constantly
by
the
commander
in
chief
after
five
in
the
evening
kutuzov
came
to
the
emperors
headquarters
and
having
spent
a
short
time
with
the
sovereign
went
to
see
the
grand
marshal
of
the
court
count
tolstoy
bolkonsky
made
use
of
this
time
to
go
to
dolgorukov
and
find
out
the
details
of
the
action
prince
andrei
sensed
that
kutuzov
was
upset
and
displeased
about
something
and
that
there
was
displeasure
with
him
at
headquarters
and
that
all
the
persons
of
the
imperial
headquarters
used
with
him
the
tone
of
people
who
knew
something
that
others
did
not
and
therefore
he
wanted
to
talk
with
dolgorukov
well
greetings
mon
cher
said
dolgorukov
who
was
having
tea
with
bilibin
the
f234te
is
tomorrow
hows
your
old
man
in
a
bad
humor
i
wouldnt
say
hes
in
a
bad
humor
but
it
seems
hed
like
to
be
heard
he
was
heard
at
the
council
of
war
and
will
be
heard
when
he
talks
to
the
point
but
to
drag
our
feet
and
wait
for
something
now
when
bonaparte
is
afraid
of
a
general
battle
more
than
anythingis
impossible
so
you
saw
him
asked
prince
andrei
well
what
is
bonaparte
like
what
impression
did
he
make
on
you
yes
i
saw
him
and
became
convinced
that
he
is
afraid
of
a
general
battle
more
than
anything
in
the
world
dolgorukov
repeated
obviously
cherishing
this
overall
conclusion
which
he
had
come
to
after
his
meeting
with
napoleon
if
he
wasnt
afraid
of
a
battle
what
would
make
him
ask
for
this
meeting
conduct
negotiations
and
above
all
retreat
when
retreat
is
so
contrary
to
his
whole
method
of
conducting
war
believe
me
hes
afraid
afraid
of
a
general
battle
his
hour
has
come
that
i
can
tell
you
but
tell
me
how
is
he
whats
he
like
prince
andrei
asked
again
hes
a
man
in
a
gray
frock
coat
who
wished
very
much
that
i
would
say
your
majesty
to
him
but
to
his
regret
did
not
receive
any
titles
from
me
thats
what
hes
like
and
nothing
more
dolgorukov
replied
glancing
at
bilibin
with
a
smile
despite
my
full
respect
for
old
kutuzov
he
went
on
what
good
ones
wed
all
be
waiting
for
something
and
giving
him
a
chance
to
escape
or
trick
us
whereas
now
hes
certainly
in
our
hands
no
we
mustnt
forget
suvorov
and
his
rules
dont
put
yourself
in
a
position
to
be
attacked
but
attack
yourself
believe
me
in
war
the
energy
of
young
men
often
points
to
a
surer
way
than
all
the
experience
of
the
old
cunctators
but
in
what
position
are
we
going
to
attack
him
i
was
at
the
outposts
today
and
its
impossible
to
tell
precisely
where
hes
camped
with
his
main
forces
said
prince
andrei
he
wanted
to
explain
to
dolgorukov
the
plan
of
attack
he
had
worked
out
for
himself
oh
that
makes
no
difference
at
all
dolgorukov
began
speaking
quickly
getting
up
and
unfolding
a
map
on
the
table
all
the
possibilities
have
been
foreseen
if
hes
camped
by
br252nn
and
prince
dolgorukov
quickly
and
vaguely
recounted
weyrothers
plan
for
a
flanking
movement
prince
andrei
started
to
object
and
demonstrate
his
own
plan
which
might
have
been
just
as
good
as
weyrothers
but
had
the
shortcoming
that
weyrothers
had
already
been
approved
as
soon
as
prince
andrei
began
to
demonstrate
the
disadvantages
of
the
latter
and
the
advantages
of
his
own
prince
dolgorukov
stopped
listening
to
him
and
gazed
absentmindedly
not
at
the
map
but
at
prince
andreis
face
anyhow
therell
be
a
council
of
war
at
kutuzovs
today
you
can
speak
all
this
out
there
said
dolgorukov
ill
do
just
that
said
prince
andrei
stepping
away
from
the
map
what
are
you
worrying
about
gentlemen
asked
bilibin
who
up
to
then
had
been
listening
to
their
conversation
with
a
merry
smile
and
was
now
obviously
going
to
come
out
with
a
quip
whether
theres
victory
or
defeat
tomorrow
the
glory
of
russian
arms
is
assured
besides
your
kutuzov
theres
not
a
single
russian
leader
of
a
column
the
leaders
are
herr
general
wimpfen
le
comte
de
langeron
le
prince
de
liechtenstein
le
prince
de
hohenloe
et
enfin
prschprschet
ainsi
de
suite
comme
tous
les
noms
polonais
taisezvous
mauvaise
langue
said
dolgorukov
its
not
true
there
are
now
two
russians
miloradovich
and
dokhturov
and
there
would
have
been
a
third
count
arakcheev
but
he
has
weak
nerves
however
i
think
mikhail
ilarionovich
has
come
out
said
prince
andrei
i
wish
you
luck
and
success
gentlemen
he
added
and
left
after
shaking
hands
with
dolgorukov
and
bilibin
on
the
way
home
prince
andrei
could
not
help
asking
kutuzov
who
was
sitting
silently
next
to
him
what
he
thought
about
the
next
days
battle
kutuzov
looked
sternly
at
his
adjutant
paused
and
said
i
think
the
battle
will
be
lost
and
i
said
so
to
count
tolstoy
and
asked
him
to
convey
it
to
the
sovereign
and
what
do
you
think
he
replied
eh
mon
cher
g233n233ral
je
me
m234le

answer
i
got
xii
after
nine
in
the
evening
weyrother
moved
with
his
plans
to
kutuzovs
quarters
where
a
council
of
war
was
called
all
the
leaders
of
columns
were
summoned
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
a
bagration
who
refused
to
come
they
all
arrived
at
the
appointed
time
weyrother
who
was
fully
in
charge
of
the
forthcoming
battle
presented
in
his
liveliness
and
briskness
a
sharp
contrast
with
the
displeased
and
drowsy
kutuzov
who
reluctantly
played
the
role
of
chairman
and
leader
of
the
council
of
war
weyrother
obviously
felt
himself
at
the
head
of
the
movement
which
had
now
become
irrepressible
he
was
like
a
horse
harnessed
to
a
wagon
and
running
downhill
whether
he
was
pulling
or
being
pushed
he
did
not
know
but
he
was
racing
with
all
possible
speed
having
no
time
left
to
discuss
what
this
movement
would
lead
to
that
evening
weyrother
had
gone
twice
to
inspect
the
enemy
lines
in
person
and
twice
to
the
emperors
russian
and
austrian
to
report
and
explain
and
then
to
his
office
where
he
had
dictated
the
german
disposition
exhausted
he
now
arrived
at
kutuzovs
he
was
clearly
so
preoccupied
that
he
even
forgot
to
be
respectful
with
the
commander
in
chief
he
interrupted
him
spoke
quickly
unclearly
not
looking
into
his
interlocutors
eyes
not
answering
the
questions
put
to
him
was
covered
with
mud
and
looked
pitiful
exhausted
disconcerted
and
at
the
same
time
presumptuous
and
proud
kutuzov
occupied
a
modest
noblemans
castle
near
ostralitz
in
the
big
drawing
room
turned
into
the
commander
in
chiefs
office
were
gathered
kutuzov
himself
weyrother
and
the
members
of
the
council
of
war
they
were
having
tea
they
were
only
waiting
for
prince
bagration
in
order
to
begin
the
council
of
war
finally
after
seven
oclock
prince
bagrations
orderly
officer
arrived
with
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
be
there
prince
andrei
came
in
to
report
that
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
availing
himself
of
the
permission
given
him
earlier
by
kutuzov
to
be
present
at
the
council
remained
in
the
room
since
prince
bagration
wont
be
coming
we
can
begin
said
weyrother
hurriedly
getting
up
from
his
place
and
approaching
the
table
on
which
an
enormous
map
of
the
environs
of
br252nn
was
spread
kutuzov
in
an
unbuttoned
uniform
from
which
his
fat
neck
as
if
released
poured
out
over
the
collar
was
sitting
in
a
voltaire
armchair
his
pudgy
old
mans
hands
placed
symmetrically
on
the
two
armrests
and
was
almost
asleep
at
the
sound
of
weyrothers
voice
he
opened
his
one
eye
with
effort
yes
yes
please
or
it
will
get
late
he
said
and
nodding
his
head
lowered
it
and
again
closed
his
eye
if
the
members
of
the
council
at
first
thought
kutuzov
was
pretending
to
sleep
the
sounds
his
nose
produced
during
the
reading
that
followed
proved
that
for
the
commander
in
chief
at
that
moment
the
point
of
the
matter
was
something
far
more
important
than
a
wish
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
disposition
or
for
anything
at
all
the
point
of
the
matter
was
to
satisfy
the
irresistible
human
need
for
sleep
he
was
indeed
asleep
weyrother
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
is
too
busy
to
waste
even
a
moment
of
his
time
glanced
at
kutuzov
and
assuring
himself
that
he
was
asleep
took
up
the
paper
and
began
to
read
the
disposition
for
the
future
battle
in
a
loud
monotonous
tone
under
the
title
which
he
also
read
disposition
for
the
attack
on
the
enemys
position
behind
kobelnitz
and
sokolnitz
20
november
1805
the
disposition
was
very
complex
and
difficult
the
original
began
da
der
feind
mit
seinem
linken
fl252gel
an
die
mit
wald
bedeckten
berge
lehnt
und
sich
mit
seinem
rechten
fl252gel
l228ngs
kobelnitz
und
sokolnitz
hinter
die
dort
befindlichen
teiche
zieht
wir
im
gegenteil
mit
unserem
linken
fl252gel
seinen
rechten
sehr
debordieren
so
ist
es
vorteilhaft
letzteren
fl252gel
des
feindes
zu
attakieren
besonders
wenn
wir
die
d246rfer
sokolnitz
und
kobelnitz
im
besitze
haben
wodurch
wir
dem
feind
zugleich
in
die
flanke
fallen
und
ihn
auf
der
fl228che
zwischen
schlapanitz
und
dem
thuerassawalde
verfolgen
k246nnen
indem
wir
dem
defileen
von
schlapanitz
und

ausweichen

die
feindliche

zu
diesem
endzwecke
ist
es
n246tigdie
erste
kolonne
marschiertdie
zweite

marschiertdie
dritte
kolonne
marschiert
and
so
on
read
weyrother
the
generals
seemed
to
listen
reluctantly
to
the
difficult
disposition
the
tall
fairhaired
general
buxh246wden
stood
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
and
resting
his
eyes
on
the
burning
candle
seemed
not
to
be
listening
and
even
not
to
want
it
to
be
thought
that
he
was
listening
directly
opposite
weyrother
fixing
his
shining
wideopen
eyes
on
him
in
a
martial
pose
hands
on
his
knees
elbows
turned
out
sat
ruddy
miloradovich
with
raisedup
mustache
and
shoulders
he
was
obstinately
silent
staring
into
weyrothers
face
and
took
his
eyes
off
him
only
when
the
austrian
chief
of
staff
fell
silent
then
miloradovich
looked
around
significantly
at
the
other
generals
but
by
the
significance
of
this
significant
gaze
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
agreed
or
disagreed
was
satisfied
or
dissatisfied
with
the
disposition
closest
of
all
to
weyrother
count
langeron
sat
and
with
a
subtle
smile
on
his
southern
french
face
which
did
not
abandon
him
throughout
the
reading
gazed
at
his
slender
fingers
quickly
twirling
by
the
corners
a
golden
snuffbox
with
a
portrait
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
longest
periods
he
stopped
the
spinning
movement
of
the
snuffbox
raised
his
head
and
with
an
unpleasant
politeness
at
the
very
corners
of
his
thin
lips
interrupted
weyrother
and
wanted
to
say
something
but
the
austrian
general
without
breaking
off
his
reading
frowned
angrily
and
waved
his
elbows
as
if
to
say
later
later
you
can
tell
me
your
thoughts
but
now
kindly
look
at
the
map
and
listen
langeron
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
glanced
at
miloradovich
as
if
seeking
an
explanation
but
meeting
miloradovichs
significant
gaze
which
signified
nothing
he
sadly
lowered
his
eyes
and
again
began
twirling
the
snuffbox
une
le231on
de
g233ographie
he
said
as
if
to
himself
but
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
przebyszewski
with
deferential
but
dignified
politeness
put
his
hand
to
his
ear
towards
weyrother
having
the
air
of
a
man
whose
attention
is
absorbed
the
short
dokhturov
sat
directly
opposite
weyrother
with
a
diligent
and
modest
look
and
bending
over
the
spreadout
map
conscientiously
studied
the
disposition
and
the
unfamiliar
terrain
he
asked
weyrother
several
times
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
heard
properly
and
the
difficult
names
of
the
villages
weyrother
did
as
he
asked
and
dokhturov
wrote
them
down
when
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
over
langeron
again
stopped
the
snuffbox
and
without
looking
at
weyrother
or
anyone
in
particular
began
speaking
about
the
difficulty
of
following
such
a
disposition
in
which
the
position
of
the
enemy
is
assumed
to
be
known
when
that
position
may
not
be
known
to
us
since
the
enemy
is
on
the
move
langerons
objections
were
wellfounded
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
purpose
of
those
objections
consisted
primarily
in
bringing
it
home
to
general
weyrother
who
had
read
his
disposition
with
such
selfassurance
as
if
to
schoolboys
that
he
had
to
do
not
with
mere
fools
but
with
people
who
could
give
him
lessons
in
military
matters
when
the
monotonous
sound
of
weyrothers
voice
fell
silent
kutuzov
opened
his
eyes
like
a
miller
who
wakes
up
at
an
interruption
of
the
soporific
sound
of
the
mill
wheels
listened
to
what
langeron
was
saying
andas
if
to
say
ah
youre
still
going
on
about
these
stupiditiesquickly
closed
his
eyes
and
lowered
his
head
still
more
trying
to
offend
weyrother
as
stingingly
as
he
could
in
his
amour
propre
as
a
military
author
langeron
demonstrated
that
bonaparte
could
easily
attack
instead
of
being
attacked
and
thereby
make
this
disposition
totally
useless
weyrother
responded
to
all
his
objections
with
a
firm
contemptuous
smile
obviously
prepared
beforehand
for
every
objection
regardless
of
what
might
be
said
to
him
if
he
could
attack
us
he
would
have
done
so
today
he
said
you
think
then
that
he
is
powerless
asked
langeron
he
has
forty
thousand
men
if
that
weyrother
replied
with
the
smile
of
a
doctor
being
told
by
a
wise
woman
how
to
treat
a
patient
in
that
case
hes
going
to
his
destruction
by
waiting
for
our
attack
langeron
said
with
a
subtle
ironic
smile
again
glancing
for
support
to
miloradovich
who
was
nearest
to
him
but
at
that
moment
miloradovich
was
obviously
thinking
least
of
all
of
what
the
generals
were
arguing
about
ma
foi
he
said
tomorrow
well
see
it
all
on
the
battlefield
weyrother
again
smiled
that
same
ironic
smile
which
said
that
to
him
it
was
ridiculous
and
strange
to
meet
objections
from
russian
generals
and
prove
that
of
which
he
was
not
only
all
too
well
assured
himself
but
of
which
he
had
assured
the
two
emperors
the
enemy
has
put
out
his
fires
and
a
continual
noise
is
heard
from
his
camp
he
said
what
does
that
mean
either
he
is
retreating
which
is
the
one
thing
we
should
fear
or
he
is
changing
his
position
he
smiled
but
even
if
he
takes
up
a
position
in
thuerassa
he
is
only
saving
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
all
orders
to
the
smallest
detail
remain
the
same
but
how
is
that
said
prince
andrei
who
had
already
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
a
chance
to
express
his
doubts
kutuzov
woke
up
cleared
his
throat
loudly
and
glanced
around
at
the
generals
gentlemen
the
disposition
for
tomorrow
for
today
even
because
its
already
past
twelve
cannot
be
changed
he
said
you
have
heard
it
and
we
will
all
do
our
duty
and
theres
nothing
more
important
before
a
battle
he
paused
than
a
good
nights
sleep
he
made
as
if
to
rise
the
generals
bowed
and
withdrew
it
was
already
past
midnight
prince
andrei
left
the
council
of
war
at
which
prince
andrei
had
not
managed
to
speak
out
his
opinion
as
he
had
hoped
to
left
in
him
a
vague
and
disturbing
impression
who
was
rightdolgorukov
and
weyrother
or
kutuzov
and
langeron
and
the
others
who
did
not
approve
the
plan
of
attackhe
did
not
know
but
was
it
really
impossible
for
kutuzov
to
speak
his
mind
directly
to
the
sovereign
can
it
really
not
be
done
otherwise
can
it
really
be
that
for
court
and
personal
considerations
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
must
be
riskedand
my
own
my
life
he
thought
yes
i
may
very
well
be
killed
tomorrow
he
thought
and
suddenly
with
that
thought
of
death
a
whole
series
of
the
most
remote
and
most
soulfelt
memories
arose
in
his
imagination
he
remembered
his
last
farewell
from
his
father
and
his
wife
he
remembered
the
first
time
of
his
love
for
her
remembered
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
for
himself
and
in
an
emotionally
softened
and
troubled
state
he
left
the
cottage
in
which
he
was
billeted
with
nesvitsky
and
began
pacing
in
front
of
the
house
the
night
was
misty
and
through
the
mist
moonlight
shone
mysteriously
yes
tomorrow
tomorrow
he
thought
tomorrow
maybe
everything
will
be
over
for
me
all
these
memories
will
be
no
more
all
these
memories
will
simply
have
no
more
sense
for
me
tomorrow
maybeeven
certainly
i
have
a
presentiment
of
itfor
the
first
time
ill
finally
have
to
show
all
i
can
do
and
he
imagined
the
battle
its
loss
the
concentration
of
the
fighting
at
one
point
and
the
bewilderment
of
all
the
superiors
and
here
that
happy
moment
that
toulon
he
has
so
long
awaited
finally
presents
itself
to
him
he
voices
his
opinion
firmly
and
clearly
to
kutuzov
and
weyrother
and
to
the
emperors
all
are
struck
by
the
correctness
of
his
thinking
but
no
one
undertakes
to
carry
it
out
and
here
he
takes
a
regiment
a
division
negotiates
the
condition
that
no
one
interfere
with
his
instructions
and
leads
his
division
to
the
decisive
point
and
alone
wins
the
victory
and
death
and
suffering
says
another
voice
but
prince
andrei
does
not
respond
to
that
voice
and
goes
on
with
his
successes
the
disposition
for
the
next
battle
he
does
alone
he
bears
the
title
of
an
officer
on
duty
in
kutuzovs
army
but
he
does
everything
alone
he
alone
wins
the
next
battle
kutuzov
is
replaced
he
is
appointedwell
and
then
the
other
voice
says
again
and
then
if
youre
not
wounded
killed
or
deceived
ten
times
overwell
then
what
well
then
prince
andrei
answers
himself
i
dont
know
what
will
happen
then
i
dont
want
to
know
and
i
cant
know
but
if
i
want
this
want
glory
want
to
be
known
to
people
want
to
be
loved
by
them
its
not
my
fault
that
i
want
it
that
its
the
only
thing
i
want
the
only
thing
i
live
for
yes
the
only
thing
ill
never
tell
it
to
anyone
but
my
god
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
nothing
except
glory
except
peoples
love
death
wounds
loss
of
family
nothing
frightens
me
and
however
near
and
dear
many
people
are
to
memy
father
my
sister
my
wifethe
dearest
people
to
mebut
however
terrible
and
unnatural
it
seems
id
give
them
all
now
for
a
moment
of
glory
of
triumph
over
people
for
love
from
people
i
dont
know
and
will
never
know
for
the
love
of
these
people
here
he
thought
listening
to
the
talk
in
kutuzovs
yard
from
kutuzovs
yard
came
the
voices
of
orderlies
preparing
to
sleep
one
voice
probably
of
a
coachman
who
was
teasing
kutuzovs
old
cook
whom
prince
andrei
knew
and
whose
name
was
titus
said
titus
hey
titus
well
replied
the
old
man
titus
dont
bite
us
said
the
joker
pah
go
to
the
devil
a
voice
cried
drowned
out
by
the
guffawing
of
the
orderlies
and
servants
and
still
the
only
thing
i
love
and
cherish
is
triumph
over
all
of
them
i
cherish
that
mysterious
power
and
glory
hovering
over
me
here
in
this
mist
xiii
that
night
rostov
was
on
the
picket
line
with
his
platoon
forward
of
bagrations
detachment
his
hussars
were
scattered
in
pairs
along
the
line
he
himself
rode
the
line
on
horseback
trying
to
fight
off
the
sleep
that
was
irresistibly
overcoming
him
behind
him
could
be
seen
the
immense
expanse
of
our
armys
campfires
burning
dimly
in
the
mist
ahead
of
him
was
misty
darkness
however
much
rostov
peered
into
this
misty
distance
he
saw
nothing
now
some
grayish
some
blackish
shape
seemed
to
appear
now
it
was
as
if
lights
flickered
where
the
enemy
ought
to
be
now
it
seemed
only
some
glimmer
in
his
own
eyes
his
eyes
kept
closing
and
in
his
imagination
the
sovereign
appeared
then
denisov
then
moscow
memories
and
he
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
again
and
saw
close
in
front
of
him
the
head
and
ears
of
the
horse
he
was
riding
sometimes
the
black
figures
of
hussars
when
he
came
within
six
paces
of
them
and
in
the
distance
the
same
misty
darkness
why
not
it
might
well
be
thought
rostov
that
the
sovereign
meeting
me
gives
me
some
assignment
saying
as
to
any
officer
go
and
find
out
whats
there
there
are
many
stories
about
how
he
got
to
know
some
officer
quite
by
chance
and
attached
him
to
himself
what
if
he
attached
me
to
himself
oh
how
id
protect
him
how
id
tell
him
the
whole
truth
how
id
expose
the
deceivers
and
so
as
to
picture
vividly
to
himself
his
love
and
devotion
for
the
sovereign
he
pictured
to
himself
an
enemy
or
a
deceitful
german
whom
he
delighted
not
only
in
killing
but
in
slapping
in
the
face
before
the
sovereigns
eyes
suddenly
a
distant
cry
aroused
rostov
he
gave
a
start
and
opened
his
eyes
where
am
i
ah

in
the
line
watchword
and
passwordshaft
olm252tz
how
vexing
that

round
and

the
general
and

him
he
righted
himself
in
the
saddle
and
touched
up
his
horse
in
order
to
make
one
more
round
of
his
hussars
he
thought
it
was
getting
lighter
to
the
left
he
could
see
a
sloping
litup
hillside
and
across
from
it
a
black
knoll
that
seemed
steep
as
a
wall
on
this
knoll
was
a
white
spot
that
rostov
could
not
make
sense
of
was
it
a
moonlit
clearing
in
the
woods
or
some
leftover
snow
or
some
white
houses
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
something
was
moving
on
that
white
spot
it
must
be

spot

said
the
voice
of
a
hussar
whom
rostov
falling
asleep
was
riding
past
rostov
suddenly
raised
his
head
which
had
already
dropped
to
his
horses
mane
and
stopped
beside
the
hussar
a
young
childish
sleep
was
irresistibly
coming
over
him
but
what
was
i
thinking
i
mustnt
forget
how

going

natashka

yes
thats

and
again
his
head
dropped
to
his
horses
neck
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
shot
at
what
whatcut
them
down
what
said
rostov
coming
to
his
senses
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
rostov
heard
ahead
of
him
where
the
enemy
was
the
drawnout
cries
of
thousands
of
voices
his
horse
and
the
hussars
who
was
standing
next
to
him
pricked
up
their
ears
at
these
cries
in
the
place
where
the
cries
came
from
a
little
fire
flared
up
and
went
out
then
another
then
all
along
the
line
of
french
troops
on
the
hill
fires
flared
up
and
the
cries
grew
louder
and
louder
rostov
heard
the
sounds
of
french
words
but
could
not
make
them
out
too
many
voices
were
shouting
all
that
was
heard
was
aaaa
and
rrrr
what
is
it
what
do
you
think
rostov
turned
to
the
hussar
standing
beside
him
is
it
from
the
enemy
the
hussar
did
not
reply
what
dont
you
hear
it
rostov
asked
again
after
waiting
some
time
for
a
reply
who
knows
your
honor
the
hussar
replied
reluctantly
by
the
place
it
should
be
the
enemy
rostov
repeated
maybe
him
or
maybe
just
so
the
hussar
said
a
night
thing
easy
now
he
cried
to
his
horse
who
was
stirring
under
him
rostovs
horse
was
also
restive
stamping
its
hoof
on
the
frozen
ground
listening
to
the
sounds
and
looking
at
the
fires
the
cries
of
the
voices
grew
louder
and
louder
and
merged
in
a
general
clamor
that
only
an
army
of
several
thousand
could
produce
the
lights
spread
more
and
more
probably
along
the
line
of
the
french
camp
rostov
was
no
longer
sleepy
the
cheerful
triumphant
cries
from
the
enemy
army
had
an
exhilarating
effect
on
him
rostov
could
now
hear
clearly
vive
lempereur
lempereur
its
nearbymust
be
across
the
stream
he
said
to
the
hussar
standing
beside
him
the
hussar
only
sighed
making
no
reply
and
cleared
his
throat
angrily
down
the
line
of
hussars
the
hoofbeats
of
a
trotting
horse
were
heard
and
suddenly
out
of
the
night
mist
looking
like
a
huge
elephant
emerged
the
figure
of
a
hussar
sergeant
the
generals
your
honor
said
the
sergeant
riding
up
to
rostov
rostov
still
looking
towards
the
fires
and
cries
rode
with
the
sergeant
to
meet
several
horsemen
who
were
riding
along
the
line
one
was
on
a
white
horse
prince
bagration
and
prince
dolgorukov
with
their
adjutants
had
ridden
out
to
look
at
the
strange
phenomenon
of
the
fires
and
cries
in
the
enemy
army
rostov
riding
up
to
bagration
reported
to
him
and
joined
the
adjutants
trying
to
hear
what
the
generals
were
saying
believe
me
said
prince
dolgorukov
addressing
bagration
this
is
nothing
but
a
ruse
he
has
retreated
and
has
ordered
the
rear
guard
to
light
fires
and
make
noise
in
order
to
deceive
us
hardly
said
bagration
i
saw
them
on
that
knoll
this
evening
if
they
had
left
they
would
have
pulled
out
from
there
as
well
officer
prince
bagration
turned
to
rostov
are
his
pickets
still
posted
there
this
evening
they
were
but
now
i
cant
tell
your
excellency
give
the
order
and
ill
go
there
with
my
hussars
said
rostov
bagration
stopped
and
without
replying
tried
to
make
out
rostovs
face
in
the
mist
go
then
he
said
after
a
brief
silence
yes
sir
rostov
spurred
his
horse
called
sergeant
fedchenko
and
two
more
hussars
told
them
to
follow
him
and
rode
at
a
trot
down
the
hill
in
the
direction
of
the
continuing
cries
rostov
felt
both
frightened
and
elated
to
be
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
distance
where
no
one
had
been
before
him
bagration
shouted
to
him
from
above
not
to
go
beyond
the
brook
but
rostov
pretended
not
to
hear
his
words
and
without
stopping
rode
further
and
further
on
constantly
making
mistakes
taking
bushes
for
trees
and
hollows
for
people
and
constantly
explaining
his
mistakes
to
himself
having
trotted
down
the
hill
he
no
longer
saw
either
our
own
or
the
enemys
fires
but
he
heard
the
cries
of
the
french
more
loudly
and
clearly
in
the
bottom
he
saw
before
him
something
like
a
stream
but
when
he
reached
it
he
recognized
it
as
a
trodden
road
coming
out
onto
the
road
he
reined
in
his
horse
undecided
whether
to
follow
it
or
to
cross
and
ride
over
the
black
field
up
the
hillside
to
ride
along
the
road
which
stood
out
lighter
in
the
mist
was
less
dangerous
because
he
could
see
people
better
follow
me
he
said
crossed
the
road
and
began
to
gallop
up
the
hill
to
the
place
where
french
pickets
had
been
posted
in
the
evening
there
he
is
your
honor
one
of
the
hussars
said
behind
him
and
before
rostov
had
time
to
make
out
something
that
loomed
up
black
in
the
mist
a
flash
gleamed
a
shot
cracked
and
a
bullet
as
if
complaining
about
something
whined
high
up
in
the
mist
and
flew
out
of
earshot
a
second
musket
misfired
but
there
was
a
flash
in
the
pan
rostov
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
four
more
shots
rang
out
at
various
intervals
and
bullets
went
singing
in
various
tones
somewhere
in
the
mist
rostov
reined
in
his
horse
who
was
elated
like
himself
by
the
shooting
and
rode
on
slowly
more
now
more
now
a
cheerful
voice
was
saying
in
his
soul
but
there
was
no
more
shooting
only
as
he
approached
bagration
rostov
sent
his
horse
into
a
gallop
again
and
with
his
hand
to
his
visor
rode
up
to
him
dolgorukov
was
still
insisting
on
his
opinion
that
the
french
had
retreated
and
lit
fires
only
to
deceive
us
what
does
that
prove
he
was
saying
as
rostov
rode
up
to
them
they
could
retreat
and
leave
pickets
clearly
they
have
not
all
left
prince
said
bagration
till
tomorrow
morning
tomorrow
well
find
out
everything
there
are
pickets
on
the
hill
your
excellency
in
the
same
place
as
this
evening
rostov
reported
bending
forward
holding
his
hand
to
his
visor
and
unable
to
repress
a
cheerful
smile
called
up
in
him
by
his
ride
and
above
all
by
the
whine
of
the
bullets
very
good
very
good
said
bagration
thank
you
lieutenant
your
excellency
said
rostov
allow
me
to
make
a
request
what
is
it
tomorrow
our
squadron
is
assigned
to
the
reserves
allow
me
to
request
that
you
attach
me
to
the
first
squadron
what
is
your
name
count
rostov
ah
very
well
stay
with
me
as
an
orderly
officer
are
you
ilya
andreichs
son
asked
dolgorukov
but
rostov
did
not
reply
so
ill
be
counting
on
it
your
excellency
i
will
give
the
order
tomorrow
thought
rostov
i
may
very
well
be
sent
on
some
sort
of
mission
to
the
sovereign
thank
god
the
cries
and
fires
in
the
enemy
army
came
from
the
fact
that
while
napoleons
orders
were
being
read
to
the
troops
the
emperor
himself
rode
around
his
bivouacs
the
soldiers
seeing
the
emperor
set
fire
to
bundles
of
straw
and
ran
after
him
shouting
vive
lempereur
napoleons
orders
were
the
following
soldiers
the
russian
army
is
marching
against
us
in
order
to
avenge
the
austrian
army
of
ulm
these
are
the
same
battalions
that
you
crushed
at
hollabrunn
and
have
since
been
pursuing
constantly
as
far
as
this
place
the
positions
we
occupy
are
strong
and
while
they
move
to
surround
me
on
the
right
they
will
expose
their
flank
to
me
soldiers
i
myself
will
direct
your
battalions
i
will
stay
out
of
fire
if
you
with
your
usual
courage
bring
disorder
and
confusion
to
the
enemys
ranks
but
if
victory
should
be
doubtful
even
for
a
moment
you
will
see
your
emperor
subjecting
himself
to
the
first
blows
of
the
enemy
because
there
can
be
no
hesitations
about
victory
especially
on
this
day
when
what
is
at
stake
is
the
honor
of
the
french
infantry
which
is
so
necessary
to
the
honor
of
our
nation
do
not
break
ranks
on
the
pretext
of
removing
the
wounded
let
each
of
you
be
fully
pervaded
by
the
thought
that
we
must
defeat
these
mercenaries
of
england
inspired
by
such
hatred
of
our
nation
this
victory
will
end
our
campaign
and
we
will
be
able
to
return
to
our
winter
quarters
where
new
french
troops
now
being
raised
in
france
will
find
us
and
then
the
peace
which
i
will
conclude
will
be
worthy
of
my
people
you
and
myself
napoleon

at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
it
was
still
quite
dark
the
troops
of
the
center
the
reserves
and
bagrations
right
flank
still
stood
motionless
but
on
the
left
flank
the
columns
of
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
which
were
to
be
the
first
to
descend
from
the
heights
in
order
to
attack
the
french
right
flank
and
drive
them
back
to
the
bohemian
mountains
according
to
the
disposition
had
already
begun
to
stir
and
get
up
from
their
night
camp
the
smoke
of
the
bonfires
onto
which
everything
superfluous
was
thrown
stung
the
eyes
it
was
cold
and
dark
officers
hastily
drank
tea
and
ate
breakfast
soldiers
chewed
on
biscuits
beat
their
feet
to
warm
them
up
and
streamed
towards
the
bonfires
throwing
onto
them
the
remains
of
their
leantos
chairs
tables
wheels
barrels
everything
superfluous
which
it
was
impossible
to
take
with
them
austrian
column
leaders
shuttled
among
the
russian
troops
and
served
as
heralds
of
the
departure
as
soon
as
an
austrian
officer
appeared
at
a
regimental
commanders
camp
the
regiment
began
to
stir
soldiers
ran
from
the
bonfires
stuffed
pipes
into
boot
tops
bags
into
wagons
took
their
muskets
and
fell
in
officers
buttoned
their
coats
buckled
on
their
swords
and
pouches
and
strode
along
the
ranks
calling

and

and
tied
down

and
regimental
commanders
mounted
up
crossed
themselves
gave
final

and
commissions
to
those
who
were
staying
with
the
train
and
the
monotonous
tramp
of
thousands
of
feet
began
columns
started
to
move
not
knowing
where
and
owing
to
the
surrounding
people
the
smoke
and
the
thickening
fog
seeing
neither
the
place
they
were
leaving
nor
the
place
they
were
going
to
a
soldier
in
movement
is
as
hemmed
in
limited
and
borne
along
by
his
regiment
as
a
sailor
by
his
ship
however
far
he
may
go
whatever
strange
unknown
and
dangerous
latitudes
he
gets
into
around
himas
for
the
sailor
always
and
everywhere
there
are
the
same
decks
masts
and
rigging
of
his
shipalways
and
everywhere
there
are
the
same
comrades
the
same
ranks
the
same
sergeant
major
ivan
mitrich
the
same
company
dog
zhuchka
the
same
superiors
a
soldier
rarely
wishes
to
know
what
latitudes
his
whole
ship
has
gotten
to
but
on
the
day
of
battle
god
knows
how
and
from
where
a
stern
note
is
heard
in
the
moral
world
of
the
troops
the
same
for
everyone
which
sounds
the
approach
of
something
decisive
and
solemn
and
arouses
in
them
an
unaccustomed
curiosity
on
days
of
battle
soldiers
excitedly
try
to
get
beyond
the
interests
of
their
regiment
listen
intently
look
about
and
greedily
inquire
into
what
is
going
on
around
them
the
fog
was
so
thick
that
though
day
was
breaking
one
could
not
see
ten
paces
ahead
bushes
looked
like
enormous
trees
level
places
like
cliffs
and
slopes
everywhere
on
all
sides
one
might
run
into
an
enemy
invisible
ten
paces
away
but
the
columns
marched
for
a
long
time
through
the
same
fog
going
down
and
up
hills
past
gardens
and
fences
over
new
incomprehensible
terrain
without
coming
across
the
enemy
anywhere
on
the
contrary
the
soldiers
realized
that
ahead
behind
on
all
sides
our
russian
columns
were
moving
in
the
same
direction
every
soldier
felt
pleased
at
heart
knowing
that
many
many
more
russian
soldiers
were
going
where
he
was
going
that
is
no
one
knew
where
see
there
the
kursky
lads
just
marched
by
came
from
one
of
the
ranks
its
scary
brother
the
troops
weve
gathered
last
night
i
looked
when
they
lit
the
fires
there
was
no
end
of
them
moscowin
short
though
none
of
the
column
leaders
rode
up
to
the
ranks
and
spoke
to
the
soldiers
the
column
leaders
as
we
saw
at
the
council
of
war
were
illhumored
and
displeased
with
the
action
undertaken
and
therefore
were
only
following
orders
and
did
not
bother
cheering
up
the
soldiers
despite
that
the
soldiers
marched
on
cheerily
as
always
when
going
into
action
especially
on
the
offensive
but
having
gone
for
about
an
hour
in
the
thick
fog
the
major
the
troops
were
forced
to
halt
and
an
unpleasant
awareness
of
disorder
and
muddleheadedness
passed
through
the
ranks
how
such
awareness
is
conveyed
is
quite
difficult
to
define
but
it
is
unquestionable
that
it
is
conveyed
with
extraordinary
sureness
and
flows
swiftly
imperceptibly
and
irresistibly
like
water
through
a
glen
if
the
russian
army
had
been
alone
without
allies
much
time
might
still
have
passed
before
this
awareness
of
disorder
became
a
general
conviction
but
now
ascribing
the
cause
of
the
disorder
with
particular
pleasure
and
naturalness
to
the
muddleheaded
germans
everyone
became
convinced
that
the
harmful
confusion
taking
place
was
the
doing
of
the
sausage
makers
whats
the
holdup
is
the
way
blocked
or
have
we
already
run
into
the
french
no
doesnt
sound
like
it
otherwise
theyd
have
started
shooting
so
they
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
started
but
once
they
got
startedhere
we
stand
witless
in
the
middle
of
a
fieldits
all
these
cursed
germans
confusing
things
what
muddleheaded
devils
so
id
have
let
them
take
the
lead
but
no
they
huddle
in
the
rear
and
now
we
stand
here
on
empty
stomachs
well
how
long
will
it
be
they
say
the
cavalrys
blocked
the
road
said
an
officer
eh
the
cursed
germans
they
dont
know
their
own
country
said
another
what
division
are
you
an
adjutant
shouted
riding
up
the
eighteenth
then
what
are
you
doing
here
you
should
have
gone
ahead
long
ago
now
you
wont
get
through
till
evening
such
stupid
orders
they
dont
know
what
theyre
doing
themselves
the
officer
said
and
rode
off
then
a
general
rode
by
and
angrily
shouted
something
not
in
russian
tafalafa
and
theres
no
telling
what
hes
mumbling
a
soldier
said
mimicking
the
general
as
he
rode
off
id
shoot
the
scoundrels
we
were
ordered
to
be
in
place
before
nine
but
were
not
halfway
there
what
orders
was
repeated
from
different
sides
and
the
feeling
of
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
set
out
for
action
began
to
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
at
the
muddleheaded
orders
and
the
germans
the
reason
for
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
austrian
cavalry
was
moving
on
the
left
flank
the
superior
officers
decided
that
our
center
was
too
far
from
the
right
flank
and
the
entire
cavalry
was
ordered
to
cross
over
to
the
right
several
thousand
cavalry
were
advancing
ahead
of
the
infantry
and
the
infantry
was
forced
to
wait
at
the
head
a
confrontation
took
place
between
an
austrian
column
leader
and
a
russian
general
the
russian
general
shouted
demanding
that
the
cavalry
be
stopped
the
austrian
insisted
that
the
fault
lay
not
with
him
but
with
the
superior
officers
the
troops
meanwhile
stood
there
bored
and
losing
heart
after
an
hours
delay
the
troops
finally
moved
on
and
began
to
descend
the
hill
the
fog
which
was
lifting
on
the
hilltop
only
grew
thicker
in
the
bottom
where
the
troops
were
descending
at
the
head
in
the
fog
a
shot
rang
out
then
another
at
first
irregularly
at
various
intervals
tratatat
then
more
regularly
and
rapidly
and
the
action
at
the
goldbach
stream
began
not
counting
on
meeting
the
enemy
below
by
the
stream
and
coming
upon
them
by
chance
in
the
fog
hearing
not
a
word
of
encouragement
from
the
superior
officers
with
the
awareness
spread
among
the
troops
that
they
were
late
and
above
all
seeing
nothing
ahead
or
around
them
in
the
thick
fog
the
russians
lazily
and
slowly
exchanged
fire
with
the
enemy
moved
forward
and
again
halted
not
receiving
timely
orders
from
the
officers
and
adjutants
who
wandered
through
the
fog
over
the
unfamiliar
terrain
unable
to
find
their
units
thus
the
action
began
for
the
first
second
and
third
columns
which
had
descended
the
hill
the
fourth
column
with
which
kutuzov
himself
was
occupied
the
pratzen
heights
in
the
bottom
where
the
action
began
the
fog
was
still
thick
up
above
it
had
cleared
but
nothing
of
what
was
happening
ahead
could
be
seen
whether
all
the
enemy
forces
were
six
miles
away
from
us
as
we
supposed
or
were
there
in
that
fog
no
one
knew
until
past
eight
oclock
it
was
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
an
unbroken
sea
of
fog
spread
below
but
at
the
village
of
schlapanitz
on
the
heights
where
napoleon
stood
surrounded
by
his
marshals
it
was
perfectly
light
over
him
was
the
clear
blue
sky
and
the
enormous
ball
of
the
sun
like
an
enormous
hollow
crimson
float
bobbed
on
the
surface
of
the
milky
sea
of
fog
the
whole
french
army
including
napoleon
himself
and
his
staff
not
only
were
not
on
the
far
side
of
the
streams
and
bottomland
of
the
villages
of
sokolnitz
and
schlapanitz
where
we
intended
to
take
up
a
position
and
begin
the
action
but
were
on
the
near
side
so
close
to
our
troops
that
napoleon
with
his
naked
eye
could
distinguish
between
our
troops
on
horseback
and
on
foot
napoleon
sat
a
little
in
front
of
his
marshals
on
a
small
gray
arabian
horse
in
his
dark
blue
greatcoat
the
same
in
which
he
had
made
the
italian
campaign
he
peered
silently
at
the
hills
which
seemed
to
rise
up
from
the
sea
of
fog
and
over
which
russian
troops
were
moving
in
the
distance
and
he
listened
to
the
sounds
of
gunfire
in
the
hollow
on
his
face
still
lean
at
that
time
not
a
muscle
stirred
his
glistening
eyes
were
fixed
motionlessly
on
one
place
his
conjectures
turned
out
to
be
correct
the
russian
army
had
already
descended
into
the
hollow
towards
the
ponds
and
lakes
still
clearing
off
from
the
pratzen
heights
which
he
intended
to
attack
and
considered
the
key
to
the
position
he
saw
amidst
the
fog
in
the
depression
between
two
hills
near
the
village
of
pratz
russian
columns
their
bayonets
glittering
moving
all
in
one
direction
towards
the
hollows
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
sea
of
fog
from
the
information
he
had
received
in
the
evening
from
the
sounds
of
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
during
the
night
at
the
outposts
from
the
disorderly
movement
of
the
russian
columns
from
all
his
conjectures
he
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
considered
him
to
be
far
ahead
of
them
that
the
columns
moving
near
pratz
constituted
the
center
of
the
russian
army
and
that
the
center
was
already
sufficiently
weakened
for
him
to
attack
it
successfully
but
he
still
did
not
begin
the
action
that
day
was
a
solemn
day
for
himthe
anniversary
of
his
coronation
before
morning
he
had
dozed
off
for
a
few
hours
and
healthy
cheerful
fresh
in
that
happy
state
of
mind
in
which
everything
seems
possible
and
everything
succeeds
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
he
stood
motionless
gazing
at
the
heights
appearing
from
the
fog
and
on
his
cold
face
there
was
that
particular
tinge
of
selfconfident
welldeserved
happiness
that
can
be
seen
on
the
face
of
a
boy
who
has
happily
fallen
in
love
his
marshals
stood
behind
him
not
daring
to
distract
his
attention
he
looked
now
at
the
pratzen
heights
now
at
the
sun
floating
out
of
the
fog
when
the
sun
had
fully
emerged
from
the
fog
and
its
dazzling
brilliance
sprayed
over
the
fields
and
the
fog
it
was
as
if
he
had
only
been
waiting
for
that
to
begin
the
action
he
took
the
glove
from
his
beautiful
white
hand
made
a
sign
to
the
marshals
and
gave
the
order
for
the
action
to
begin
the
marshals
accompanied
by
adjutants
galloped
off
in
various
directions
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
main
forces
of
the
french
army
were
moving
swiftly
towards
those
same
pratzen
heights
from
which
the
russian
troops
had
cleared
off
more
and
more
descending
to
the
left
into
the
hollow
xv
at
eight
oclock
kutuzov
rode
to
pratz
at
the
head
of
miloradovichs
fourth
column
the
one
which
was
to
take
the
place
of
the
columns
of
przebyszewski
and
langeron
which
had
already
gone
down
he
greeted
the
men
of
the
head
regiment
and
gave
the
order
to
move
thus
showing
that
he
intended
to
lead
the
column
himself
having
ridden
to
the
village
of
pratz
he
halted
prince
andrei
one
of
the
enormous
number
of
persons
constituting
the
commander
in
chiefs
suite
stood
behind
him
prince
andrei
felt
excited
irritated
and
at
the
same
time
restrainedly
calm
as
a
man
usually
is
when
a
longdesired
moment
comes
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
this
was
the
day
of
his
toulon
or
his
bridge
of
arcole
how
it
would
happen
he
did
not
know
but
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
it
would
be
so
the
locality
and
position
of
our
troops
were
known
to
him
as
far
as
they
could
be
known
to
anyone
in
our
army
his
own
strategic
plan
which
there
obviously
could
be
no
thought
of
carrying
out
now
was
forgotten
now
entering
into
weyrothers
plan
prince
andrei
pondered
the
possible
happenstances
and
came
up
with
new
considerations
such
as
might
call
for
his
swiftness
of
reflection
and
decisiveness
to
the
left
below
in
the
fog
exchanges
of
fire
between
unseen
troops
could
be
heard
there
it
seemed
to
prince
andrei
the
battle
would
concentrate
there
an
obstacle
would
be
encountered
and
its
there
that
ill
be
sent
with
a
brigade
or
division
and
there
with
a
standard
in
my
hand
ill
go
forward
and
crush
everything
ahead
of
me
prince
andrei
could
not
look
with
indifference
at
the
standards
of
the
battalions
going
past
him
looking
at
a
standard
he
thought
maybe
it
is
that
very
standard
with
which
ill
have
to
march
at
the
head
of
the
troops
by
morning
the
nights
fog
had
left
only
hoarfrost
turning
into
dew
on
the
heights
but
in
the
hollows
the
fog
still
spread
its
milkwhite
sea
nothing
could
be
seen
in
that
hollow
to
the
left
into
which
our
troops
had
descended
and
from
which
came
the
sounds
of
gunfire
over
the
heights
was
a
dark
clear
sky
and
to
the
rightthe
enormous
ball
of
the
sun
far
ahead
on
the
other
shore
of
the
sea
of
fog
one
could
make
out
the
jutting
wooded
hills
on
which
the
enemy
army
was
supposed
to
be
and
something
was
discernible
to
the
right
the
guards
were
entering
the
region
of
the
fog
with
a
sound
of
tramping
and
wheels
and
an
occasional
gleam
of
bayonets
to
the
left
beyond
the
village
similar
masses
of
cavalry
approached
and
disappeared
into
the
sea
of
fog
in
front
and
behind
moved
the
infantry
the
commander
in
chief
stood
on
the
road
out
of
the
village
letting
the
troops
pass
by
him
kutuzov
seemed
exhausted
and
irritable
that
morning
the
infantry
going
past
him
halted
without
any
command
apparently
because
something
ahead
held
them
up
but
tell
them
finally
to
form
into
battalions
and
go
around
the
village
kutuzov
said
angrily
to
a
general
who
rode
up
dont
you
understand
your
excellency
my
dear
sir
that
to
stretch
out
in
a
defile
through
village
streets
is
impossible
when
were
marching
against
an
enemy
i
intended
to
form
them
up
outside
the
village
your
excellency
said
the
general
kutuzov
laughed
biliously
a
fine
sight
youd
be
lining
up
in
view
of
the
enemy
a
very
fine
sight
the
enemys
still
far
off
your
excellency
according
to
the
disposition
the
disposition
kutuzov
exclaimed
biliously
who
told
you
thatkindly
do
as
youre
ordered
yes
sir
mon
cher
nesvitsky
said
to
prince
andrei
in
a
whisper
le
vieux
est
dune
humeur
de
chien
an
austrian
officer
in
a
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
on
his
hat
rode
up
to
kutuzov
and
asked
on
behalf
of
the
emperor
whether
the
fourth
column
had
started
into
action
kutuzov
turned
away
without
answering
him
and
his
gaze
chanced
to
rest
on
prince
andrei
who
was
standing
close
by
seeing
bolkonsky
kutuzov
softened
the
angry
and
caustic
expression
of
his
gaze
as
if
aware
that
his
adjutant
was
not
to
blame
for
what
was
going
on
and
without
answering
the
austrian
adjutant
he
addressed
bolkonsky
allez

mon
cher
si
la

le

diteslui
de

prince
andrei
had
only
just
started
when
he
stopped
him
et
demandezlui
si
les
tirailleurs
sont
post233s
he
added
ce
quils
font
ce
quils
font
he
said
to
himself
still
not
answering
the
austrian
prince
andrei
galloped
off
to
carry
out
his
mission
overtaking
all
the
advancing
battalions
he
stopped
the
third
division
and
ascertained
that
there
was
in
fact
no
line
of
riflemen
in
front
of
our
columns
the
regimental
commander
of
the
front
regiment
was
very
surprised
by
the
order
conveyed
to
him
from
the
commander
in
chief
to
send
out
riflemen
the
regimental
commander
stood
there
in
the
full
conviction
that
there
were
more
troops
ahead
of
him
and
that
the
enemy
was
no
less
than
six
miles
away
in
fact
nothing
could
be
seen
ahead
but
empty
terrain
sloping
away
and
covered
with
thick
fog
having
ordered
on
behalf
of
the
commander
in
chief
that
the
omission
be
rectified
prince
andrei
galloped
back
kutuzov
still
stood
in
the
same
place
and
his
corpulent
body
sagging
over
the
saddle
in
old
mans
fashion
yawned
deeply
closing
his
eyes
the
troops
were
no
longer
moving
but
stood
at
parade
rest
very
good
very
good
he
said
to
prince
andrei
and
turned
to
a
general
who
stood
there
with
a
watch
in
his
hand
saying
it
was
time
to
move
on
because
all
the
columns
of
the
left
flank
had
already
descended
we
still
have
time
your
excellency
kutuzov
said
through
a
yawn
we
have
time
he
repeated
just
then
from
well
behind
kutuzov
came
shouts
of
regimental
greetings
and
these
voices
began
to
approach
quickly
along
the
whole
extended
line
of
the
advancing
russian
columns
it
was
clear
that
the
one
being
greeted
was
riding
quickly
when
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
kutuzov
was
standing
in
front
of
began
to
shout
he
rode
slightly
to
one
side
and
wincing
turned
to
look
down
the
road
from
pratz
galloped
what
looked
like
a
squadron
of
varicolored
horsemen
two
of
them
rode
side
by
side
at
a
great
gallop
ahead
of
the
rest
one
in
a
black
uniform
with
white
plumes
rode
a
bobtailed
chestnut
horse
the
other
in
a
white
uniform
rode
a
black
horse
these
were
the
two
emperors
with
their
suite
kutuzov
with
the
affectation
of
a
frontline
veteran
ordered
his
standing
troops
to
attention
and
saluting
rode
up
to
the
emperor
his
whole
figure
and
manner
suddenly
changed
he
acquired
the
look
of
a
subordinate
unthinking
man
with
affected
deference
which
obviously
struck
the
emperor
alexander
unpleasantly
he
rode
up
and
saluted
him
the
unpleasant
impression
like
the
remains
of
fog
in
a
clear
sky
passed
over
the
emperors
young
and
happy
face
and
disappeared
he
was
somewhat
thinner
that
day
after
his
illness
than
on
the
field
of
olm252tz
where
bolkonsky
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
abroad
but
there
was
the
same
enchanting
combination
of
majesty
and
mildness
in
his
beautiful
gray
eyes
and
the
fine
lips
had
the
same
possibility
of
various
expressions
with
a
prevalent
expression
of
goodnatured
innocent
youth
at
the
olm252tz
review
he
was
more
majestic
here
he
was
more
cheerful
and
energetic
he
was
slightly
flushed
after
galloping
two
miles
and
reining
in
his
horse
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
looked
around
at
the
faces
of
his
suite
as
young
as
animated
as
his
own
czartoryski
and
novosiltsev
and
prince
volkonsky
and
stroganov
and
the
others
all
richly
clad
cheerful
young
men
on
splendid
pampered
fresh
only
slightly
sweaty
horses
talking
and
smiling
stopped
behind
the
sovereign
the
emperor
franz
a
ruddy
longfaced
young
man
sat
extremely
straight
on
his
handsome
black
stallion
and
looked
around
him
with
a
preoccupied
unhurried
air
he
called
up
one
of
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
something
most
likely
what
time
they
started
thought
prince
andrei
observing
his
old
aquaintance
and
recalling
his
audience
with
a
smile
he
was
unable
to
repress
in
the
emperors
suite
there
were
picked
fine
young
orderly
officers
russian
and
austrian
from
the
guards
and
infantry
regiments
among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
handsome
spare
horses
of
the
royalty
in
embroidered
cloths
as
fresh
air
from
the
fields
suddenly
breathes
through
an
open
window
into
a
stuffy
room
so
youth
energy
and
certainty
of
success
breathed
upon
kutuzovs
cheerless
staff
as
these
brilliant
young
men
galloped
up
why
dont
you
begin
mikhail
larionovich
the
emperor
alexander
hurriedly
addressed
kutuzov
at
the
same
time
glancing
courteously
at
the
emperor
franz
i
am
waiting
your
majesty
answered
kutuzov
inclining
deferentially
the
emperor
cupped
his
ear
frowning
slightly
and
showing
that
he
had
not
heard
properly
im
waiting
your
majesty
kutuzov
repeated
prince
andrei
noticed
that
kutuzovs
upper
lip
twitched
unnaturally
as
he
said
this
waiting
not
all
the
columns
are
assembled
your
majesty
the
sovereign
heard
but
this
reply
clearly
did
not
please
him
he
shrugged
his
slightly
stooping
shoulders
glanced
at
novosiltsev
who
stood
nearby
as
if
complaining
of
kutuzov
by
this
glance
were
not
on
the
tsaritsyn
field
mikhail
larionovich
where
you
dont
start
a
parade
until
all
the
regiments
are
assembled
said
the
sovereign
again
glancing
into
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
franz
as
though
inviting
him
if
not
to
take
part
at
least
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
but
the
emperor
franz
went
on
looking
around
and
did
not
listen
that
is
just
why
i
do
not
begin
sire
kutuzov
said
in
a
ringing
voice
as
if
to
forestall
the
possibility
of
not
being
heard
and
again
something
twitched
in
his
face
i
do
not
begin
sire
because
we
are
not
on
parade
and
not
on
the
tsaritsyn
field
he
uttered
clearly
and
distinctly
all
the
faces
in
the
sovereigns
suite
instantly
exchanged
glances
with
each
other
expressing
murmur
and
reproach
old
as
he
may
be
he
should
not
he
simply
should
not
speak
that
way
these
faces
expressed
the
sovereign
looked
fixedly
and
attentively
into
kutuzovs
eyes
waiting
to
see
if
he
would
say
something
more
but
kutuzov
for
his
part
bowed
his
head
deferentially
and
also
seemed
to
be
waiting
the
silence
lasted
for
about
a
minute
however
if
you
order
it
your
majesty
said
kutuzov
raising
his
head
and
again
changing
his
tone
to
that
of
a
dull
unthinking
but
obedient
general
he
touched
up
his
horse
and
calling
to
him
the
column
leader
miloradovich
gave
him
the
order
to
advance
the
troops
stirred
again
and
two
battalions
of
the
novgorodsky
regiment
and
a
battalion
of
the
apsheronsky
regiment
moved
on
past
the
sovereign
while
this
apsheronsky
battalion
was
marching
by
ruddyfaced
miloradovich
with
no
greatcoat
in
his
uniform
tunic
and
decorations
and
a
hat
with
enormous
plumes
worn
at
an
angle
and
brim
first
galloped
ahead
huptwo
and
with
a
dashing
salute
reined
in
his
horse
before
the
sovereign
god
be
with
you
general
said
the
sovereign
ma

sire
he
replied
merrily
nevertheless
calling
up
mocking
smiles
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
with
his
bad
french
miloradovich
turned
his
horse
sharply
and
placed
himself
slightly
behind
the
sovereign
the
apsherontsy
excited
by
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
marched
past
the
emperors
and
their
suite
at
a
dashingly
brisk
pace
beating
their
feet
lads
cried
miloradovich
in
a
loud
selfassured
and
merry
voice
obviously
so
excited
by
the
sounds
of
gunfire
the
anticipation
of
battle
and
the
sight
of
his
gallant
apsherontsyhis
companions
from
suvorovs
timemarching
briskly
past
the
emperors
that
he
forgot
the
sovereigns
presence
lads
it
wont
be
the
first
village
youve
taken
he
shouted
we
do
our
best
sir
the
soldiers
shouted
out
the
sovereigns
horse
shied
at
the
sudden
shout
this
horse
who
had
carried
the
sovereign
at
reviews
while
still
in
russia
also
carried
her
rider
here
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
enduring
the
distracted
nudges
of
his
left
foot
pricked
up
her
ears
at
the
sound
of
gunshots
just
as
she
did
on
the
field
of
mars
understanding
neither
the
meaning
of
the
shots
she
heard
nor
the
presence
of
the
emperor
franzs
black
stallion
nor
anything
of
what
her
rider
said
thought
or
felt
that
day
the
sovereign
turned
with
a
smile
to
one
of
his
retinue
pointing
to
the
gallant
apsherontsy
and
said
something
to
him
xvi
kutuzov
accompanied
by
his
adjutants
rode
at
a
walk
behind
the
carabineers
having
gone
less
than
half
a
mile
at
the
tail
of
the
column
he
stopped
by
a
solitary
deserted
house
probably
a
former
tavern
where
the
road
forked
both
roads
went
down
the
hill
and
troops
were
marching
along
both
the
fog
began
to
lift
and
enemy
troops
could
be
dimly
seen
about
a
mile
and
a
half
away
on
the
heights
opposite
to
the
left
below
the
gunfire
was
growing
louder
kutuzov
stopped
talking
with
an
austrian
general
prince
andrei
standing
slightly
behind
him
peered
at
the
enemy
and
turned
to
an
adjutant
wishing
to
borrow
a
field
glass
from
him
look
look
said
this
adjutant
looking
not
at
the
distant
troops
but
down
the
hill
in
front
of
him
its
the
french
the
two
generals
and
the
adjutants
began
snatching
at
the
field
glass
pulling
it
away
from
each
other
all
their
faces
suddenly
changed
and
on
all
of
them
horror
appeared
the
french
were
supposed
to
be
a
mile
and
a
half
from
us
and
they
suddenly
turned
up
right
in
front
of
us
is
it
the
enemynoyes
look
hesfor
certainwhat
is
this
voices
said
with
his
naked
eye
prince
andrei
saw
below
to
the
right
a
dense
column
of
french
coming
up
to
meet
the
apsherontsy
no
further
than
five
hundred
paces
from
where
kutuzov
was
standing
here
it
is
the
decisive
moment
has
come
now
its
my
turn
thought
prince
andrei
and
spurring
his
horse
he
rode
up
to
kutuzov
the
apsherontsy
must
be
stopped
your
excellency
he
cried
but
at
that
same
moment
everything
became
covered
with
smoke
there
was
the
sound
of
gunfire
nearby
and
a
na239vely
frightened
voice
two
steps
from
prince
andrei
cried
well
brothers
thats
it
for
us
and
it
was
as
if
this
voice
was
a
command
at
this
voice
everyone
began
to
run
confused
ever
increasing
crowds
came
running
back
to
the
place
where
five
minutes
before
the
troops
had
marched
past
the
emperors
not
only
was
it
difficult
to
stop
this
crowd
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
yield
and
move
back
with
it
bolkonsky
tried
only
not
to
be
separated
from
kutuzov
and
looked
around
in
perplexity
unable
to
understand
what
was
happening
in
front
of
him
nesvitsky
looking
angry
red
and
not
like
himself
shouted
to
kutuzov
that
if
he
did
not
leave
at
once
he
would
certainly
be
taken
prisoner
kutuzov
stood
in
the
same
place
and
without
responding
took
out
his
handkerchief
blood
was
flowing
from
his
cheek
prince
andrei
forced
his
way
to
him
are
you
wounded
he
asked
barely
able
to
control
the
trembling
of
his
lower
jaw
the
wound
isnt
here
its
there
said
kutuzov
pressing
the
handkerchief
to
his
wounded
cheek
and
pointing
to
the
fleeing
men
stop
them
he
cried
and
at
the
same
time
probably
realizing
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
them
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
right
a
fresh
crowd
of
fleeing
men
streamed
past
caught
him
up
and
carried
him
backwards
the
troops
were
fleeing
in
such
a
dense
crowd
that
once
one
landed
in
the
middle
of
it
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
someone
shouted
keep
going
dont
drag
your
feet
another
turning
around
fired
into
the
air
someone
else
struck
the
horse
on
which
kutuzov
himself
was
riding
extricating
themselves
with
the
greatest
effort
from
the
flow
of
the
crowd
to
the
left
kutuzov
and
his
suite
diminished
by
more
than
half
rode
towards
the
sounds
of
nearby
cannon
fire
extricating
himself
from
the
crowd
of
fleeing
men
prince
andrei
trying
to
keep
up
with
kutuzov
saw
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
amidst
the
smoke
a
russian
battery
still
firing
and
the
french
running
up
to
it
slightly
higher
stood
russian
infantry
neither
moving
ahead
to
aid
the
battery
nor
backwards
in
the
direction
of
the
fugitives
a
general
on
horseback
separated
himself
from
the
infantry
and
rode
up
to
kutuzov
there
were
only
four
men
left
in
kutuzovs
suite
they
were
all
pale
and
exchanged
glances
silently
stop
those
villains
kutuzov
said
breathlessly
to
the
regimental
commander
pointing
to
the
fleeing
men
but
at
the
same
moment
as
if
in
punishment
for
those
words
bullets
like
a
flock
of
birds
flew
whistling
at
the
regiment
and
kutuzovs
suite
the
french
had
attacked
the
battery
and
seeing
kutuzov
were
shooting
at
him
with
this
volley
the
regimental
commander
seized
his
leg
several
soldiers
fell
and
an
ensign
holding
a
standard
let
it
drop
from
his
hands
the
standard
wavered
and
fell
stopped
momentarily
by
the
bayonets
of
the
soldiers
around
it
the
soldiers
began
firing
without
any
orders
oooh
kutuzov
moaned
with
an
expression
of
despair
and
looked
around
bolkonsky
he
whispered
in
a
voice
trembling
with
awareness
of
his
old
mans
strengthlessness
bolkonsky
he
whispered
pointing
to
the
disordered
battalion
and
the
enemy
whats
going
on
but
before
he
finished
saying
it
prince
andrei
feeling
sobs
of
shame
and
anger
rising
in
his
throat
was
already
jumping
off
his
horse
and
running
towards
the
standard
forward
lads
he
cried
in
a
childishly
shrill
voice
here
it
is
thought
prince
andrei
seizing
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
hearing
with
delight
the
whistle
of
bullets
evidently
aimed
precisely
at
him
several
soldiers
fell
hurrah
cried
prince
andrei
barely
able
to
hold
up
the
heavy
standard
and
he
ran
forward
with
unquestioning
assurance
that
the
entire
battalion
would
run
after
him
and
indeed
he
ran
only
a
few
steps
alone
one
soldier
started
out
another
and
the
whole
battalion
with
a
shout
of
hurrah
rushed
forward
and
overtook
him
a
sergeant
of
the
battalion
ran
up
took
the
standard
that
was
wavering
in
prince
andreis
hands
because
of
its
weight
but
was
killed
at
once
prince
andrei
again
seized
the
standard
and
dragging
it
by
the
staff
ran
with
the
battalion
ahead
of
him
he
saw
our
artillerists
some
of
whom
were
fighting
while
others
abandoned
the
cannon
and
came
running
in
his
direction
he
also
saw
french
infantrymen
who
had
seized
the
artillery
horses
and
were
turning
the
cannon
prince
andrei
and
his
battalion
were
now
twenty
paces
from
the
cannon
above
him
he
heard
the
unceasing
whistle
of
bullets
and
soldiers
ceaselessly
gasped
and
fell
to
right
and
left
of
him
but
he
did
not
look
at
them
he
looked
fixedly
only
at
what
was
happening
ahead
of
himat
the
battery
he
clearly
saw
the
figure
of
a
redhaired
gunner
his
shako
knocked
askew
pulling
a
swab
from
one
side
while
a
french
soldier
pulled
it
towards
him
from
the
other
side
prince
andrei
saw
clearly
the
bewildered
and
at
the
same
time
angry
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
two
men
who
evidently
did
not
understand
what
they
were
doing
what
are
they
doing
prince
andrei
wondered
looking
at
them
why
doesnt
the
redhaired
artillerist
run
away
since
he
has
no
weapon
why
doesnt
the
frenchman
stab
him
before
he
runs
away
the
frenchman
will
remember
his
musket
and
bayonet
him
in
fact
another
frenchman
with
his
musket
atilt
ran
up
to
the
fighting
men
and
the
lot
of
the
redhaired
artillerist
who
still
did
not
understand
what
awaited
him
and
triumphantly
pulled
the
swab
from
the
french
soldiers
hands
was
about
to
be
decided
but
prince
andrei
did
not
see
how
it
ended
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
one
of
the
nearest
soldiers
with
the
full
swing
of
a
stout
stick
hit
him
on
the
head
it
was
slightly
painful
and
above
all
unpleasant
because
the
pain
distracted
him
and
kept
him
from
seeing
what
he
had
been
looking
at
what
is
it
am
i
falling
are
my
legs
giving
way
under
me
he
thought
and
fell
on
his
back
he
opened
his
eyes
hoping
to
see
how
the
fight
between
the
french
and
the
artillerists
ended
and
wishing
to
know
whether
or
not
the
redhaired
artillerist
had
been
killed
whether
the
cannon
had
been
taken
or
saved
but
he
did
not
see
anything
there
was
nothing
over
him
now
except
the
skythe
lofty
sky
not
clear
but
still
immeasurably
lofty
with
gray
clouds
slowly
creeping
across
it
how
quiet
calm
and
solemn
not
at
all
like
when
i
was
running
thought
prince
andrei
not
like
when
we
were
running
shouting
and
fighting
not
at
all
like
when
the
frenchman
and
the
artillerist
with
angry
and
frightened
faces
were
pulling
at
the
swabits
quite
different
the
way
the
clouds
creep
across
this
lofty
infinite
sky
how
is
it
i
havent
seen
this
lofty
sky
before
and
how
happy
i
am
that
ive
finally
come
to
know
it
yes
everything
is
empty
everything
is
a
deception
except
this
infinite
sky
there
is
nothing
nothing
except
that
but
there
is
not
even
that
there
is
nothing
except
silence
tranquillity
and
thank
god
xvii
at
nine
oclock
the
action
had
not
yet
begun
for
bagration
on
the
right
flank
not
wishing
to
agree
to
dolgorukovs
request
to
begin
action
and
wishing
to
avert
responsibility
from
himself
prince
bagration
suggested
to
dolgorukov
that
he
send
to
ask
the
commander
in
chief
bagration
knew
that
with
a
stretch
of
nearly
six
miles
separating
one
flank
from
the
other
if
the
messenger
was
not
killed
which
was
very
probable
and
even
if
he
found
the
commander
in
chief
which
would
be
quite
difficult
he
would
not
come
back
before
evening
bagration
looked
over
his
suite
with
his
big
expressionless
sleepy
eyes
and
rostovs
childlike
face
involuntarily
transfixed
with
excitement
and
hope
was
the
first
thing
that
struck
his
eye
he
sent
him
and
if
i
should
meet
his
majesty
before
the
commander
in
chief
your
excellency
asked
rostov
holding
his
hand
to
his
visor
you
can
give
the
message
to
his
majesty
said
dolgorukov
hastily
cutting
off
bagration
after
being
relieved
from
the
picket
line
rostov
had
managed
to
sleep
for
a
few
hours
before
morning
and
he
felt
cheerful
bold
resolute
with
that
suppleness
of
movement
assurance
of
his
good
luck
and
in
that
state
of
mind
in
which
everything
seems
easy
cheerful
and
possible
all
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
morning
general
battle
was
to
be
given
he
was
to
take
it
moreover
he
was
an
orderly
officer
of
the
bravest
of
generals
moreover
he
was
going
with
a
message
to
kutuzov
and
maybe
to
the
sovereign
himself
the
morning
was
bright
the
horse
under
him
was
good
he
felt
joyful
and
happy
on
receiving
the
order
he
started
his
horse
and
rode
along
the
line
first
he
rode
along
the
line
of
bagrations
troops
who
had
not
yet
gone
into
action
and
stood
motionless
then
he
rode
into
the
space
occupied
by
uvarovs
cavalry
and
here
he
noticed
movement
and
signs
of
preparation
for
action
having
passed
uvarovs
cavalry
he
clearly
heard
the
sounds
of
cannon
and
gunfire
ahead
of
him
the
fire
kept
intensifying
in
the
fresh
morning
air
the
shooting
was
no
longer
as
beforeat
irregular
intervals
two
or
three
gunshots
then
one
or
two
cannon
shotsnow
on
the
slopes
of
the
hills
before
pratz
one
could
hear
rolling
salvos
of
musket
fire
interrupted
by
such
rapid
cannon
fire
that
at
times
the
separate
shots
could
not
be
distinguished
from
each
other
but
merged
into
a
general
roar
one
could
see
the
puffs
of
gunsmoke
as
if
running
and
chasing
each
other
on
the
slopes
and
the
smoke
of
the
cannon
swirling
spreading
and
merging
together
one
could
see
from
the
gleam
of
bayonets
amidst
the
smoke
the
moving
masses
of
infantry
and
the
narrow
strips
of
artillery
with
green
caissons
rostov
stopped
his
horse
for
a
minute
on
a
knoll
so
as
to
see
what
was
going
on
but
no
matter
how
he
strained
his
attention
he
could
neither
understand
nor
make
out
what
was
going
on
some
sort
of
men
were
moving
about
in
the
smoke
some
sort
of
sheets
of
troops
were
moving
in
front
and
behind
but
why
who
whereit
was
impossible
to
grasp
the
sights
and
sounds
not
only
did
not
arouse
any
sort
of
dejected
or
timid
feelings
in
him
but
on
the
contrary
gave
him
energy
and
determination
more
more
step
it
up
he
addressed
these
sounds
mentally
and
again
started
riding
along
the
line
penetrating
further
and
further
into
the
area
of
the
troops
already
going
into
action
how
its
going
to
be
i
dont
know
but
all
will
be
well
thought
rostov
having
ridden
past
some
austrian
troops
rostov
noticed
that
the
next
the
line
this
was
the
guards
had
already
gone
into
action
so
much
the
better
ill
see
it
closeup
he
thought
he
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
line
several
horsemen
came
riding
in
his
direction
they
were
our
life
uhlans
who
were
returning
from
an
attack
in
disorderly
ranks
rostov
passed
by
them
involuntarily
noticing
that
one
of
them
was
covered
with
blood
and
rode
on
its
none
of
my
business
he
thought
he
had
not
managed
to
go
a
few
hundred
paces
after
that
when
to
the
left
of
him
cutting
across
there
appeared
along
the
whole
width
of
the
field
an
enormous
mass
of
cavalrymen
on
black
horses
in
white
gleaming
uniforms
coming
straight
at
him
at
a
canter
rostov
sent
his
horse
into
a
full
gallop
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
these
cavalrymen
and
he
would
have
gotten
away
from
them
if
they
had
continued
at
the
same
speed
but
they
kept
increasing
their
pace
so
that
some
of
the
horses
were
already
galloping
rostov
heard
their
hoofbeats
and
the
clanging
of
their
weapons
growing
louder
and
louder
and
saw
their
horses
their
figures
and
even
their
faces
more
and
more
clearly
these
were
our
horse
guards
going
into
attack
against
the
french
cavalry
which
was
coming
towards
them
the
horse
guards
galloped
but
still
holding
back
their
horses
rostov
could
now
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
command
forward
forward
uttered
by
an
officer
letting
his
thoroughbred
go
at
full
speed
rostov
afraid
of
being
trampled
or
swept
into
the
attack
on
the
french
galloped
along
the
front
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
go
and
still
did
not
manage
to
avoid
them
the
last
horse
guard
a
pockmarked
man
of
enormous
height
frowned
angrily
seeing
rostov
in
front
of
him
where
he
would
inevitably
run
into
him
this
horse
guard
would
certainly
have
knocked
rostov
and
his
bedouin
down
rostov
felt
himself
so
small
and
weak
compared
to
these
enormous
men
and
horses
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
swing
his
whip
at
the
eyes
of
the
guardsmans
horse
the
heavy
black
twentyhand
horse
shied
laying
back
his
ears
but
the
pockmarked
horse
guard
spurred
him
as
hard
as
he
could
with
his
huge
spurs
and
the
horse
tossing
his
tail
and
stretching
his
neck
raced
on
still
faster
the
horse
guards
had
barely
gone
past
rostov
when
he
heard
their
shout
of
hurrah
and
turning
saw
their
front
ranks
mingling
with
other
probably
french
horsemen
with
red
epaulettes
beyond
that
nothing
could
be
seen
because
just
after
that
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
everything
was
covered
in
smoke
at
the
moment
when
the
horse
guards
going
past
him
disappeared
into
the
smoke
rostov
hesitated
whether
to
gallop
after
them
or
ride
where
he
was
supposed
to
this
was
that
brilliant
attack
of
the
horse
guards
which
astonished
the
french
themselves
rostov
was
horrified
to
hear
later
that
of
all
that
mass
of
enormous
handsome
men
of
all
those
brilliant
rich
men
youths
officers
and
junkers
who
had
ridden
past
him
on
thousandrouble
horses
only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
attack
why
should
i
envy
them
mine
wont
go
away
and
now
maybe
ill
see
the
sovereign
thought
rostov
and
he
rode
on
having
drawn
even
with
the
infantry
guards
he
noticed
that
cannonballs
were
flying
over
and
around
them
not
so
much
because
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
cannon
but
because
he
saw
uneasiness
on
the
soldiers
faces
and
on
the
officers
an
unnatural
military
solemnity
riding
behind
one
of
the
lines
of
the
infantry
guard
regiments
he
heard
a
voice
call
him
by
name
rostov
what
he
replied
not
recognizing
boris
imagine
we
got
into
the
front
line
our
regiment
went
into
an
attack
said
boris
smiling
that
happy
smile
which
occurs
in
young
men
who
have
been
under
fire
for
the
first
time
rostov
stopped
really
he
said
and
what
then
we
beat
them
back
boris
said
animatedly
becoming
talkative
can
you
imagine
and
boris
began
telling
how
the
guards
taking
up
their
position
and
seeing
troops
in
front
of
them
took
them
for
austrians
and
suddenly
from
the
cannonballs
fired
from
those
troops
realized
that
they
were
in
the
front
line
and
had
unexpectedly
to
go
into
action
rostov
not
hearing
boris
out
touched
up
his
horse
where
are
you
going
asked
boris
to
his
majesty
with
a
message
there
he
is
said
boris
who
thought
he
heard
rostov
say
his
highness
instead
of
his
majesty
and
he
pointed
him
to
the
grand
duke
who
a
hundred
paces
from
them
in
a
helmet
and
a
horse
guards
tunic
with
his
raised
shoulders
and
frowning
brows
was
shouting
something
to
a
white
and
palefaced
austrian
officer
but
thats
the
grand
duke
and
i
need
the
commander
in
chief
or
the
sovereign
said
rostov
and
he
touched
up
his
horse
count
count
cried
berg
as
animated
as
boris
running
up
to
him
from
the
other
side
count
im
wounded
in
the
right
hand
he
said
showing
his
hand
bloody
and
bandaged
with
a
handkerchief
and
i
stayed
in
the
line
i
hold
the
sword
in
my
left
hand
count
our
race
the
von
bergs
count
were
all
knights
berg
was
still
saying
something
but
rostov
did
not
listen
any
further
and
rode
on
having
gone
past
the
guards
and
an
empty
space
rostov
to
avoid
getting
into
the
front
line
again
as
he
had
during
the
attack
of
the
horse
guards
followed
the
line
of
the
reserves
making
a
wide
circle
around
the
place
where
the
hottest
shooting
and
cannon
fire
were
heard
suddenly
ahead
of
him
and
behind
our
troops
in
a
place
where
he
could
never
have
supposed
the
enemy
to
be
he
heard
nearby
musket
fire
what
can
that
be
thought
rostov
the
enemy
in
the
rear
of
our
troops
it
cant
be
thought
rostov
and
the
terror
of
fear
for
himself
and
for
the
outcome
of
the
whole
battle
suddenly
came
over
him
whatever
it
may
be
however
he
thought
theres
no
point
now
in
going
around
i
must
look
for
the
commander
in
chief
here
and
if
all
is
lost
then
its
my
business
to
perish
along
with
everybody
the
bad
presentiment
that
suddenly
came
over
rostov
was
confirmed
more
and
more
the
further
he
rode
into
the
space
beyond
the
village
of
pratz
occupied
by
crowds
of
different
troops
what
is
this
what
is
this
whos
being
shot
at
whos
shooting
asked
rostov
drawing
even
with
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
running
in
mixed
crowds
across
his
path
devil
knows
about
them
hes
beaten
everybody
perish
them
all
answers
came
in
russian
german
and
czech
from
the
crowds
of
fleeing
men
who
like
himself
did
not
understand
what
was
going
on
there
shoot
the
germans
cried
one
devil
take
themthe
traitors
zum
henker
diese
russen
a
german
grumbled
several
wounded
soldiers
were
walking
down
the
road
oaths
shouts
groans
merged
into
one
general
clamor
the
shooting
died
down
and
as
rostov
learned
later
it
had
been
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
shooting
at
each
other
my
god
what
is
it
thought
rostov
here
where
the
sovereign
may
see
them
at
any
momentbut
no
it
must
be
just
a
few
scoundrels
it
will
pass
thats
not
it
it
cant
be
he
thought
just
ride
past
them
quickly
quickly
the
thought
of
defeat
and
flight
could
not
enter
rostovs
head
though
he
saw
french
guns
and
troops
precisely
on
the
pratzen
heights
in
the
very
place
where
he
had
been
told
to
look
for
the
commander
in
chief
he
could
not
and
would
not
believe
it
xviii
rostov
had
been
told
to
look
for
kutuzov
and
the
sovereign
near
the
village
of
pratz
but
not
only
were
they
not
there
but
there
was
not
a
single
superior
officer
there
were
only
various
crowds
of
disorderly
troops
he
urged
on
his
already
tired
horse
so
as
to
get
quickly
past
these
crowds
but
the
further
he
went
the
more
disorderly
the
crowds
became
the
high
road
he
came
out
on
was
crowded
with
carriages
vehicles
of
all
kinds
russian
and
austrian
soldiers
of
all
arms
wounded
and
not
wounded
all
this
droned
and
swarmed
confusedly
under
the
grim
sound
of
cannonballs
flying
from
the
french
batteries
set
up
on
the
pratzen
heights
where
is
the
sovereign
where
is
kutuzov
rostov
asked
everyone
he
could
stop
and
he
got
no
answer
from
any
of
them
at
last
seizing
a
soldier
by
the
collar
he
made
him
answer
eh
brother
they
all
ran
off
ahead
there
long
ago
the
soldier
said
to
rostov
laughing
at
something
and
trying
to
free
himself
abandoning
that
soldier
who
was
obviously
drunk
rostov
stopped
the
horse
of
an
orderly
or
groom
of
some
important
person
and
began
questioning
him
the
orderly
announced
to
rostov
that
the
sovereign
had
been
driven
away
at
top
speed
in
a
carriage
an
hour
earlier
and
that
he
was
dangerously
wounded
it
cant
be
said
rostov
it
must
have
been
somebody
else
i
saw
him
myself
said
the
orderly
with
a
selfassured
grin
i
ought
to
know
the
sovereign
by
now
seems
i
saw
him
lots
of
times
in
petersburg
this
close
he
was
sitting
in
the
carriage
pale
as
can
be
four
black
horses
saints
alive
how
they
went
rattling
past
us
seems
i
ought
to
know
the
tsars
horses
and
ilya
ivanych
by
now
seems
ilya
the
coachman
drives
nobody
but
the
tsar
rostov
let
go
of
his
horse
and
wanted
to
ride
on
passing
by
a
wounded
officer
addressed
him
who
do
you
want
asked
the
officer
the
commander
in
chief
he
was
killed
by
a
cannonball
hit
in
the
chest
in
front
of
our
regiment
not
killed
wounded
another
officer
corrected
who
kutuzov
asked
rostov
not
kutuzov
but
whats
his
namewell
it
makes
no
difference
there
werent
many
left
alive
go
over
there
to
that
village
all
the
superiors
are
assembled
there
said
this
officer
pointing
to
the
village
of
hostieradek
and
he
passed
by
rostov
rode
at
a
walk
not
knowing
why
and
to
whom
he
was
going
now
the
sovereign
was
wounded
the
battle
lost
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
it
now
rostov
rode
in
the
direction
indicated
to
him
and
in
which
he
could
see
a
tower
and
a
church
in
the
distance
why
should
he
hurry
what
was
he
to
say
now
to
the
sovereign
or
to
kutuzov
even
if
they
were
alive
and
not
wounded
go
that
way
your
honor
here
youll
get
killed
straight
off
a
soldier
cried
to
him
killed
straight
off
ah
what
are
you
saying
said
another
where
are
you
sending
him
this
ways
closer
rostov
pondered
and
went
precisely
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
told
he
would
be
killed
it
makes
no
difference
now
if
even
the
sovereign
is
wounded
why
should
i
look
out
for
myself
he
thought
he
rode
into
that
space
in
which
the
most
men
fleeing
from
pratz
had
been
killed
the
french
had
not
yet
taken
this
space
but
the
russiansthose
who
were
alive
or
woundedhad
abandoned
it
long
ago
over
the
field
like
sheaves
on
good
wheatland
lay
dead
or
wounded
men
ten
to
fifteen
to
an
acre
the
wounded
crept
together
by
twos
and
threes
and
one
could
hear
their
unpleasant
cries
and
moans
sometimes
feigned
as
it
seemed
to
rostov
he
sent
his
horse
into
a
canter
so
as
not
to
see
all
these
suffering
men
and
he
felt
frightened
he
was
afraid
not
for
his
life
but
for
the
courage
he
needed
and
which
he
knew
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
these
wretches
the
french
who
had
stopped
firing
on
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
wounded
because
there
was
nothing
left
alive
on
it
seeing
an
adjutant
riding
across
it
aimed
a
cannon
and
fired
several
shots
the
sensation
of
these
whistling
fearsome
sounds
and
the
surrounding
dead
merged
for
rostov
into
a
single
impression
of
terror
and
pity
for
himself
he
recalled
his
mothers
last
letter
what
would
she
feel
he
wondered
if
she
saw
me
here
now
on
this
field
with
cannon
aimed
at
me
in
the
village
of
hostieradek
he
found
russian
troops
confused
but
heading
away
from
the
battlefield
in
greater
order
the
french
cannon
fire
did
not
carry
that
far
and
the
sounds
of
shooting
seemed
a
long
way
off
here
everyone
already
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
lost
no
matter
who
rostov
turned
to
no
one
could
tell
him
where
the
sovereign
was
or
where
kutuzov
was
some
said
that
the
rumor
of
the
sovereigns
wound
was
correct
others
said
it
was
not
and
explained
the
spread
of
this
false
rumor
by
the
fact
that
the
grand
marshal
of
the
court
count
tolstoy
who
had
ridden
to
the
battlefield
with
others
in
the
emperors
suite
had
indeed
galloped
away
from
the
battlefield
pale
and
frightened
in
the
sovereigns
carriage
one
officer
told
rostov
that
he
had
seen
someone
from
the
high
command
to
the
left
beyond
the
village
and
rostov
went
there
no
longer
hoping
to
find
anyone
but
only
to
keep
his
own
conscience
clear
having
ridden
two
miles
and
left
behind
the
last
of
the
russian
troops
rostov
saw
two
horsemen
standing
near
a
kitchen
garden
surrounded
by
a
ditch
they
were
facing
this
ditch
one
with
white
plumes
on
his
hat
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
for
some
reason
the
other
an
unfamiliar
horseman
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
the
horse
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
rode
up
to
the
ditch
spurred
his
horse
and
releasing
the
reins
lightly
jumped
over
the
garden
ditch
only
a
little
soil
crumbled
down
the
bank
from
the
horses
hind
hoofs
turning
his
horse
sharply
he
leaped
back
over
the
ditch
and
courteously
addressed
the
horseman
with
the
white
plumage
evidently
suggesting
that
he
do
the
same
the
horseman
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
to
rostov
and
for
some
reason
involuntarily
riveted
his
attention
made
a
negative
gesture
with
his
head
and
hand
and
by
this
gesture
rostov
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
adored
sovereign
but
that
cant
be
him
alone
in
the
middle
of
this
empty
field
thought
rostov
just
then
alexander
turned
his
head
and
rostov
saw
the
beloved
features
so
vividly
imprinted
on
his
memory
the
sovereign
was
pale
his
cheeks
were
hollow
his
eyes
sunken
but
there
was
all
the
more
loveliness
and
mildness
in
his
features
rostov
was
happy
now
to
be
assured
that
the
rumor
of
the
sovereigns
wound
was
incorrect
he
was
happy
to
see
him
he
knew
that
he
could
even
must
address
him
directly
and
convey
to
him
what
dolgorukov
had
ordered
him
to
convey
but
as
a
young
man
in
love
trembles
and
thrills
not
daring
to
utter
what
he
dreams
of
by
night
and
looks
about
fearfully
seeking
help
or
the
possibility
of
delay
and
flight
when
the
desired
moment
comes
and
he
stands
alone
with
her
so
now
rostov
having
attained
what
he
desired
more
than
anything
in
the
world
did
not
know
how
to
approach
the
sovereign
and
presented
thousands
of
considerations
to
himself
for
why
it
was
unsuitable
improper
and
impossible
what
its
as
if
i
was
glad
to
take
advantage
of
his
being
alone
and
dejected
it
may
be
unpleasant
and
difficult
for
him
to
meet
an
unknown
person
at
this
moment
of
sorrow
and
then
what
can
i
say
to
him
now
when
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
my
heart
stops
and
my
mouth
goes
dry
not
one
of
the
countless
speeches
to
the
sovereign
that
he
had
composed
in
his
imagination
came
to
his
head
now
those
speeches
were
for
the
most
under
quite
different
conditions
they
were
spoken
for
the
most
moments
of
victory
and
triumph
and
predominantly
on
his
deathbed
from
the
wounds
he
had
received
while
the
sovereign
thanked
him
for
his
heroic
deeds
and
he
dying
voiced
the
love
confirmed
by
his
acts
and
then
what
am
i
to
ask
the
sovereign
about
his
orders
for
the
right
flank
when
it
is
now
past
three
in
the
afternoon
and
the
battle
is
lost
no
decidedly
i
should
not
approach
him
should
not
disturb
his
thoughts
better
to
die
a
thousand
times
than
to
get
a
bad
look
or
a
bad
opinion
from
him
rostov
decided
and
rode
away
with
sorrow
and
despair
in
his
heart
constantly
turning
to
look
at
the
sovereign
still
standing
in
the
same
attitude
of
indecision
while
rostov
was
making
these
considerations
and
sorrowfully
riding
away
from
the
sovereign
captain
von
toll
happened
to
arrive
in
the
same
place
and
seeing
the
sovereign
rode
straight
up
to
him
offered
him
his
services
and
helped
him
to
cross
the
ditch
on
foot
the
sovereign
wishing
to
rest
and
feeling
unwell
sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
toll
stopped
beside
him
rostov
from
a
distance
with
envy
and
regret
saw
von
toll
say
something
to
the
sovereign
at
length
and
with
ardor
and
saw
the
sovereign
probably
weeping
cover
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
press
tolls
hand
and
i
could
be
in
his
place
rostov
thought
to
himself
and
barely
holding
back
tears
of
pity
over
the
sovereigns
fate
rode
on
in
complete
despair
not
knowing
where
he
was
going
now
or
why
his
despair
was
the
stronger
in
that
he
felt
his
own
weakness
was
the
cause
of
his
grief
he
couldnot
only
could
but
should
have
ridden
up
to
the
sovereign
and
that
was
a
unique
chance
to
show
the
sovereign
his
devotion
and
he
had
not
made
use
of
itwhat
have
i
done
he
thought
and
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
emperor
but
there
was
no
one
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
only
wagons
and
carriages
drove
along
from
one
cart
driver
he
learned
that
kutuzovs
staff
was
in
a
nearby
village
where
the
train
was
going
rostov
followed
them
ahead
of
him
walked
kutuzovs
groom
leading
horses
covered
with
cloths
behind
the
groom
came
a
wagon
and
behind
the
wagon
an
old
house
serf
in
a
peaked
cap
a
short
coat
and
with
bandy
legs
titus
hey
titus
said
the
groom
what
the
old
man
asked
distractedly
titus
dont
bite
us
eh
you
fool
pah
the
old
man
said
and
spat
angrily
some
time
passed
in
silent
movement
and
the
same
joke
was
repeated
again
by
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
battle
had
been
lost
at
all
points
more
than
a
hundred
cannon
had
already
been
captured
by
the
french
przebyszewski
and
his
corps
laid
down
their
arms
other
columns
having
lost
about
half
their
men
were
retreating
in
disorderly
confused
crowds
the
remains
of
langerons
and
dokhturovs
troops
mixed
together
crowded
around
the
dams
and
banks
of
the
ponds
near
the
village
of
augesd
after
five
oclock
it
was
only
at
the
dam
of
augesd
that
the
hot
cannon
fire
of
the
french
alone
could
be
heard
from
numerous
batteries
lined
up
on
the
slopes
of
the
pratzen
heights
and
firing
at
our
retreating
troops
in
the
rear
guard
dokhturov
and
others
drawing
up
some
battalions
fired
back
at
the
french
cavalry
who
were
pursuing
our
troops
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
on
the
narrow
dam
of
augesd
on
which
for
so
many
years
an
old
miller
in
a
cap
used
to
sit
peacefully
with
his
fishing
rods
while
his
grandson
his
shirtsleeves
rolled
up
fingered
the
silvery
trembling
fish
in
the
watering
can
on
this
dam
over
which
for
so
many
years
moravians
in
shaggy
hats
and
blue
jackets
had
peacefully
driven
in
their
twohorse
carts
laden
with
wheat
and
had
driven
back
over
the
same
dam
all
dusty
with
flour
their
carts
whitenow
on
this
narrow
dam
between
wagons
and
cannon
under
horses
and
between
wheels
crowded
men
disfigured
by
the
fear
of
death
crushing
each
other
dying
stepping
over
the
dying
and
killing
each
other
only
to
go
a
few
steps
and
be
killed
themselves
just
the
same
every
ten
seconds
pushing
through
the
air
a
cannonball
smacked
or
a
shell
exploded
in
the
midst
of
this
dense
crowd
killing
and
spattering
with
blood
those
who
stood
near
dolokhov
wounded
in
the
arm
on
foot
with
a
dozen
soldiers
of
his
company
he
was
already
an
officer
and
his
regimental
commander
on
horseback
represented
the
remainder
of
the
entire
regiment
drawn
by
the
crowd
they
pressed
into
the
entrance
to
the
dam
and
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
stopped
because
ahead
of
them
a
horse
had
fallen
under
a
cannon
and
the
crowd
was
pulling
it
out
one
cannonball
killed
someone
behind
them
another
landed
in
front
and
spattered
dolokhov
with
blood
the
crowd
pushed
on
desperately
shrank
back
went
a
few
steps
and
stopped
again
get
through
these
hundred
steps
and
im
saved
for
sure
stand
here
another
two
minutes
and
im
sure
to
be
dead
each
man
was
thinking
dolokhov
who
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
tore
his
way
to
the
edge
of
the
dam
knocking
two
soldiers
off
their
feet
and
ran
down
onto
the
slippery
ice
that
covered
the
pond
turn
off
he
cried
skipping
over
the
ice
which
cracked
under
him
turn
off
he
cried
to
the
ordnance
it
holds
the
ice
held
him
but
it
sagged
and
cracked
and
it
was
obvious
that
it
would
give
way
not
only
under
a
cannon
or
a
crowd
but
under
him
alone
people
looked
at
him
and
pressed
to
the
bank
not
yet
daring
to
step
onto
the
ice
the
regimental
commander
standing
on
horseback
at
the
entrance
raised
his
arm
and
opened
his
mouth
addressing
dolokhov
suddenly
one
of
the
cannonballs
came
whistling
so
low
over
the
crowd
that
everybody
ducked
there
was
a
wet
smack
and
the
general
and
his
horse
fell
in
a
pool
of
blood
no
one
looked
at
the
general
still
less
thought
of
picking
him
up
go
onto
the
ice
go
onto
the
ice
go
turn
off
dont
you
hear
go
cried
countless
voices
after
the
cannonball
hit
the
general
themselves
not
knowing
what
and
why
they
were
shouting
one
of
the
rearmost
cannon
going
onto
the
dam
turned
off
onto
the
ice
crowds
of
soldiers
started
running
down
off
the
dam
onto
the
frozen
pond
the
ice
cracked
under
one
of
the
foremost
soldiers
and
one
foot
went
into
the
water
he
tried
to
right
himself
and
fell
through
to
the
waist
the
nearest
soldiers
hesitated
the
cannon
driver
stopped
his
horse
but
shouts
were
still
heard
from
behind
go
onto
the
ice
dont
stop
go
go
and
cries
of
terror
were
heard
in
the
crowd
the
soldiers
around
the
gun
waved
at
the
horses
and
beat
them
to
make
them
turn
and
move
on
the
horses
set
out
from
the
bank
the
ice
that
had
held
the
foot
soldiers
gave
way
in
one
huge
piece
and
about
forty
of
them
rushed
some
back
some
forward
drowning
each
other
the
cannonballs
went
on
regularly
whistling
and
smacking
into
the
ice
into
the
water
and
most
often
into
the
crowd
that
covered
the
dam
the
ponds
and
the
bank
xix
on
the
pratzen
hill
in
the
same
place
where
he
fell
with
the
staff
of
the
standard
in
his
hands
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
lay
bleeding
profusely
and
unbeknownst
to
himself
letting
out
soft
pitiful
and
childlike
moans
towards
evening
he
stopped
moaning
and
became
completely
still
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
was
unconscious
suddenly
he
felt
himself
alive
again
and
suffering
from
a
burning
and
rending
pain
in
the
head
where
is
it
that
lofty
sky
which
i
never
knew
till
now
and
saw
today
was
his
first
thought
and
i
never
knew
this
suffering
either
he
thought
yes
i
knew
nothing
nothing
till
now
but
where
am
i
he
began
to
listen
and
heard
the
sounds
of
approaching
hoofbeats
and
the
sound
of
voices
speaking
french
he
opened
his
eyes
over
him
again
was
that
same
lofty
sky
with
floating
clouds
rising
still
higher
through
which
showed
the
blue
of
infinity
he
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
see
those
who
judging
by
the
sounds
of
hoofs
and
voices
had
ridden
up
to
him
and
stopped
the
horsemen
who
had
ridden
up
were
napoleon
accompanied
by
two
adjutants
bonaparte
riding
over
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
about
the
reinforcement
of
the
batteries
firing
at
the
dam
of
augesd
and
was
looking
at
the
dead
and
wounded
who
were
left
on
the
battlefield
de
beaux
hommes
said
napoleon
looking
at
a
dead
russian
grenadier
who
his
face
buried
in
the
ground
and
his
nape
blackened
lay
on
his
stomach
one
of
his
already
stiff
arms
flung
far
out

an

said
just
then
having
come
from
the
batteries
that
were
firing
on
augesd
faites
avancer
celles
de
la
r233serve
said
napoleon
and
riding
on
a
few
paces
he
stopped
over
prince
andrei
who
lay
on
his
back
the
staff
of
the
standard
fallen
beside
him
the
standard
had
already
been
taken
as
a
trophy
by
the
french
voil224
une
belle
mort
said
napoleon
looking
at
bolkonsky
prince
andrei
understood
that
it
had
been
said
about
him
and
that
it
was
napoleon
speaking
he
heard
the
man
who
had
said
these
words
being
addressed
as
sire
but
he
heard
these
words
as
if
he
was
hearing
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
he
not
only
was
not
interested
he
did
not
even
notice
and
at
once
forgot
them
he
had
a
burning
in
his
head
he
felt
that
he
was
losing
blood
and
he
saw
above
him
that
distant
lofty
and
eternal
sky
he
knew
that
it
was
napoleonhis
herobut
at
that
moment
napoleon
seemed
to
him
such
a
small
insignificant
man
compared
with
what
was
now
happening
between
his
soul
and
this
lofty
infinite
sky
with
clouds
racing
across
it
to
him
it
was
all
completely
the
same
at
that
moment
who
was
standing
over
him
or
what
he
said
about
him
he
was
only
glad
that
people
had
stopped
over
him
and
only
wished
that
those
people
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
to
life
which
seemed
so
beautiful
to
him
because
he
now
understood
it
so
differently
he
gathered
all
his
strength
in
order
to
stir
and
produce
some
sound
he
stirred
his
leg
weakly
and
produced
a
weak
painful
moan
that
moved
even
him
to
pity
ah
hes
alive
said
napoleon
lift
up
this
young
man
ce
jeune
homme
and
take
him
to
the
firstaid
station
having
said
that
napoleon
rode
on
further
to
meet
marshal
lannes
who
was
riding
up
to
the
emperor
taking
off
his
hat
and
congratulating
him
on
the
victory
prince
andrei
remembered
nothing
more
he
lost
consciousness
from
the
terrible
pain
of
being
put
on
the
stretcher
the
jolting
while
he
was
being
carried
and
the
probing
of
his
wound
at
the
firstaid
station
he
came
to
only
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
he
along
with
other
russian
wounded
and
captured
officers
was
taken
to
the
hospital
during
this
transfer
he
felt
somewhat
fresher
and
could
look
around
and
even
speak
the
first
words
he
heard
when
he
came
to
were
the
words
of
the
french
convoy
officer
who
was
saying
hurriedly
we
must
stop
here
the
emperor
will
ride
by
now
it
will
give
him
pleasure
to
see
all
these
gentlemen
prisoners
there
are
so
many
prisoners
today
almost
the
whole
russian
army
that
he
must
be
bored
with
it
said
another
officer
well
really
this
they
say
is
the
commander
of
all
the
emperor
alexanders
guards
said
the
first
pointing
to
a
wounded
russian
officer
in
the
white
uniform
of
the
horse
guards
bolkonsky
recognized
prince
repnin
whom
he
used
to
meet
in
petersburg
society
next
to
him
stood
another
wounded
officer
of
the
horse
guards
a
nineteenyearold
boy
bonaparte
riding
up
at
a
gallop
stopped
his
horse
whos
the
senior
man
they
named
the
colonel
prince
repnin
are
you
the
commander
of
the
emperor
alexanders
regiment
of
horse
guards
asked
napoleon
i
commanded
a
squadron
replied
repnin
your
regiment
fulfilled
its
duty
honorably
said
napoleon
the
praise
of
a
great
general
is
a
soldiers
best
reward
said
repnin
i
bestow
it
on
you
with
pleasure
said
napoleon
who
is
this
young
man
next
to
you
prince
repnin
named
lieutenant
sukhtelen
napoleon
looked
at
him
and
said
smiling

nous
youth
is
no
impediment
to
bravery
sukhtelen
said
in
a
halting
voice
a
fine
answer
said
napoleon
youll
go
far
young
man
prince
andrei
who
to
complete
the
trophy
of
prisoners
was
also
brought
out
before
the
eyes
of
the
emperor
could
not
fail
to
attract
his
attention
napoleon
evidently
remembered
seeing
him
on
the
battlefield
and
turning
to
him
used
the
same
appellation
of
young
man
jeune
homme
under
which
bolkonsky
had
been
imprinted
on
his
memory
the
first
time
et
vous
jeune
homme
and
you
young
man
he
addressed
him
how
do
you
feel
mon
brave
though
five
minutes
earlier
prince
andrei
had
been
able
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
soldiers
transporting
him
now
with
his
eyes
fixed
directly
on
napoleon
he
was
silentto
him
at
that
moment
all
the
interests
that
occupied
napoleon
seemed
so
insignificant
his
hero
himself
seemed
so
petty
to
him
with
his
petty
vanity
and
joy
in
victory
compared
with
that
lofty
just
and
kindly
sky
which
he
had
seen
and
understood
that
he
was
unable
to
answer
him
then
too
everything
seemed
so
useless
and
insignificant
compared
with
that
stern
and
majestic
way
of
thinking
called
up
in
him
by
weakness
from
loss
of
blood
suffering
and
the
expectation
of
imminent
death
looking
into
napoleons
eyes
prince
andrei
thought
about
the
insignficance
of
grandeur
about
the
insignificance
of
life
the
meaning
of
which
no
one
could
understand
and
about
the
still
greater
insignificance
of
death
the
meaning
of
which
no
one
among
the
living
could
understand
or
explain
the
emperor
receiving
no
answer
turned
away
and
as
he
rode
off
addressed
one
of
the
officers
have
these
gentlemen
looked
after
and
taken
to
my
bivouac
have
my
doctor
larrey
examine
their
wounds
goodbye
prince
repnin
and
touching
up
his
horse
he
galloped
on
on
his
face
was
the
radiance
of
selfsatisfaction
and
happiness
the
soldiers
who
had
carried
prince
andrei
and
had
taken
from
him
the
little
golden
icon
hung
on
her
brother
by
princess
marya
seeing
the
kindness
with
which
the
emperor
treated
the
prisoners
hastened
to
return
the
icon
prince
andrei
did
not
see
how
or
by
whom
it
was
put
back
on
him
but
suddenly
on
his
chest
over
the
uniform
a
little
icon
on
a
fine
gold
chain
turned
up
it
would
be
good
thought
prince
andrei
looking
at
this
icon
which
his
sister
had
hung
on
him
with
such
feeling
and
reverence
it
would
be
good
if
everything
was
as
clear
and
simple
as
it
seems
to
princess
marya
how
good
it
would
be
to
know
where
to
look
for
help
in
this
life
and
what
to
expect
after
it
there
beyond
the
grave
how
happy
and
calm
id
be
if
i
could
say
now
lord
have
mercy
on
mebut
to
whom
shall
i
say
it
either
it
is
an
indefinable
unfathomable
power
which
i
not
only
cannot
address
but
which
i
cannot
express
in
wordsthe
great
all
or
nothing
he
said
to
himself
or
it
is
that
god
whom

marya
has
sewn
in
here
in
this
amulet
nothing
nothing
is
certain
except
the
insignificance
of
everything
i
can
comprehend
and
the
grandeur
of
something
incomprehensible
but
most
important
the
stretchers
began
to
move
at
every
jolt
he
again
felt
unbearable
pain
his
feverish
state
worsened
and
he
became
delirious
those
reveries
of
his
father
wife
sister
and
future
son
and
the
tenderness
he
had
experienced
on
the
night
before
the
battle
the
figure
of
the
little
insignificant
napoleon
and
the
lofty
sky
over
it
all
constituted
the
main
basis
for
his
feverish
imaginings
he
imagined
a
quiet
life
and
peaceful
family
happiness
at
bald
hills
he
was
already
enjoying
this
happiness
when
suddenly
little
napoleon
appeared
with
his
indifferent
limited
gaze
happy
in
the
unhappiness
of
others
and
doubts
and
torments
set
in
and
only
the
sky
promised
tranquillity
towards
morning
all
his
reveries
became
confused
and
merged
into
the
chaos
and
darkness
of
unconsciousness
and
oblivion
which
in
the
opinion
of
larrey
himself
napoleons
doctor
would
most
likely
end
in
death
rather
than
recovery

nikolai
rostov
came
home
on
leave
denisov
also
went
home
to
voronezh
and
rostov
persuaded
him
to
come
with
him
as
far
as
moscow
and
stay
in
their
house
at
the
next
to
last
posting
station
denisov
met
a
friend
drank
three
bottles
of
wine
with
him
and
despite
the
bumps
of
the
road
did
not
wake
up
all
the
way
lying
on
the
bottom
of
the
horsedrawn
sleigh
beside
rostov
who
became
more
and
more
impatient
the
closer
they
came
to
moscow
soon
now
soon
now
oh
these
unbearable
streets
shops
bakeries
street
lamps
cabbies
thought
rostov
when
they
had
already
registered
their
leaves
at
the
city
gates
and
entered
moscow
denisov
were
herehes
asleep
he
said
leaning
his
whole
body
forward
as
if
hoping
by
this
posture
to
speed
up
the
movement
of
the
sleigh
denisov
did
not
respond
heres
the
intersection
where
the
cabby
zakhar
stands
heres
zakhar
and
still
the
same
horse
heres
the
grocery
where
we
used
to
buy
gingerbread
soon
now

which
house

asked
the
driver

at
the
end
the
big
one

its
our
house
said
rostov
its
our
house
denisov
denisov
were
nearly
there
denisov
raised
his
head
cleared
his
throat
and
made
no
reply
dmitri
rostov
said
to
the
servant
on
the
box
arent

lights

our
house

your
papas

that

forget
to
take
out
my
new
hungarian
jacket
for
me
at
once
rostov
added
feeling
his
new
mustache
well
on
with
you
he
cried
to
the
driver
wake
up
now
vasya
he
turned
to
denisov
who
was
lowering
his
head
again
well
on
with
you
three
roubles
for
vodka
on
with
you
shouted
rostov
when
the
sleigh
was
three
houses
away
from
their
entrance
it
seemed
to
him
the
horses
were
not
moving
at
last
the
sleigh
pulled
to
the
right
at
the
entrance
over
his
head
rostov
saw
the
familiar
cornice
with
its
chipped
stucco
the
porch
the
hitching
post
he
jumped
out
of
the
sleigh
while
it
was
still
moving
and
ran
into
the
front
hall
the
house
stood
as
immobile
unwelcoming
as
if
it
cared
nothing
for
the
one
who
had
arrived
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
my
god
is
everything
all
right
thought
rostov
stopping
for
a
moment
with
a
sinking
heart
and
at
once
set
off
running
down
the
hall
and
up
the
familiar
slanting
steps
the
same
door
handle
the
dirtiness
of
which
always
angered
the
countess
turned
as
slackly
as
ever
one
tallow
candle
was
burning
in
the
front
room
old
mikhailo
was
sleeping
on
a
trunk
the
footman
prokofy
the
one
who
was
so
strong
he
could
lift
a
carriage
by
the
back
rail
was
sitting
and
plaiting
slippers
out
of
cloth
trimmings
he
glanced
at
the
opening
door
and
his
indifferent
sleepy
expression
suddenly
transformed
into
a
rapturously
alarmed
one
saints
alive
the
young
count
he
cried
recognizing
his
young
master
what
is
this
my
dear
heart
and
prokofy
trembling
with
excitement
rushed
for
the
door
to
the
living
room
probably
to
announce
him
but
clearly
thought
again
came
back
and
pressed
himself
to
the
young
masters
shoulder
everyone
well
asked
rostov
pulling
his
arm
away
thank
god
all
of
them
thank
god
theyve
just
finished
eating
let
me
look
at
you
your
excellency
everythings
quite
all
right
thank
god
thank
god
rostov
forgetting
all
about
denisov
not
wishing
anyone
to
announce
him
beforehand
threw
off
his
fur
coat
and
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
big
dark
reception
room
everything
was
the
samethe
same
card
tables
the
same
chandelier
in
its
cover
but
someone
had
already
seen
the
young
master
and
before
he
reached
the
drawing
room
something
flew
out
of
a
side
door
precipitously
like
a
storm
and
embraced
and
began
kissing
him
a
second
then
a
third
such
being
sprang
from
a
second
a
third
door
more
embraces
more
kisses
more
shouts
tears
of
joy
he
could
not
make
out
where
and
who
was
his
papa
who
was
natasha
who
was
petya
everybody
wept
talked
and
kissed
him
at
the
same
time

clung
to
his
legs
and
me
too
he
cried
natasha
pulled
him
down
to
her
and
kissed
his
face
all
over
then
jumped
back
and
holding
the
skirt
of
his
hungarian
jacket
hopped
up
and
down
in
one
place
like
a
little
goat
and
shrieked
piercingly
on
all
sides
there
were
loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
joy
there
were
lips
that
wanted
to
kiss
him
sonya
bright
red
also
held
him
by
the
hand
all
beaming
in
the
blissful
gaze
she
directed
at
his
eyes
which
she
had
been
waiting
for
sonya
had
already
turned
sixteen
and
she
was
very
beautiful
especially
in
this
moment
of
happy
rapturous
animation
she
looked
at
him
not
taking
her
eyes
away
smiling
and
holding
her
breath
he
glanced
at
her
gratefully
but
was
still
waiting
and
looking
for
someone
the
old
countess
had
not
come
out
yet
and
then
footsteps
were
heard
at
the
door
the
footsteps
were
so
quick
that
they
could
not
have
been
his
mothers
but
it
was
she
in
a
new
dress
unfamiliar
to
him
which
must
have
been
made
in
his
absence
everyone
let
him
go
and
he
ran
to
her
when
they
came
together
she
fell
on
his
breast
weeping
she
could
not
lift
her
face
and
only
pressed
it
to
the
cold
cords
of
his
hungarian
jacket
denisov
unnoticed
by
anyone
came
into
the
room
stood
there
and
rubbed
his
eyes
looking
at
them
vassily
denisov
friend
of
your
son
he
said
introducing
himself
to
the
old
count
who
was
looking
at
him
questioningly
i
bid
you
welcome
i
know
i
know
said
the
count
kissing
and
embracing
denisov
nikolushka
wrote
to
usnatasha
vera
heres
denisov
the
same
happy
rapturous
faces
turned
to
denisovs
shaggy
little
figure
with
its
black
mustaches
and
surrounded
him
darling
denisov
shrieked
natasha
beside
herself
with
rapture
and
she
ran
to
him
embraced
and
kissed
him
everyone
was
embarrassed
by
natashas
behavior
denisov
also
blushed
but
smiled
and
taking
natashas
hand
kissed
it
denisov
was
taken
to
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
all
the
rostovs
gathered
in
the
sitting
room
around
nikolushka
the
old
countess
never
letting
go
of
his
hand
which
she
kissed
every
other
moment
sat
next
to
him
the
rest
clustered
around
them
catching
his
every
movement
word
gaze
and
not
taking
their
rapturously
loving
eyes
off
him
his
brother
and
sisters
argued
and
snatched
the
places
nearest
to
him
from
each
other
and
fought
over
who
was
going
to
bring
him
tea
a
handkerchief
a
pipe
rostov
was
very
happy
in
the
love
that
was
shown
him
but
the
first
moment
of
their
meeting
had
been
so
blissful
that
his
present
happiness
seemed
too
little
to
him
and
he
kept
waiting
for
more
and
more
and
more
the
next
morning
the
new
arrivals
slept
till
past
nine
in
the
adjoining
room
sabers
bags
pouches
open
suitcases
dirty
boots
lay
about
two
pairs
of
polished
boots
with
spurs
had
just
been
put
near
the
wall
the
servants
brought
washbasins
and
hot
water
for
shaving
and
brushed
their
clothes
there
was
a
smell
of
tobacco
and
men
hey
rishka
my
pipe
cried
vaska
denisovs
hoarse
voice
get
up
rostov
rostov
rubbing
his
gluedtogether
eyes
raised
his
disheveled
head
from
the
hot
pillow
what
is
it
late
yes
its
past
nine
natashas
voice
replied
and
in
the
next
room
the
rustle
of
starched
skirts
whispers
and
the
laughter
of
girls
voices
were
heard
and
through
the
slightly
open
door
flashed
something
light
blue
ribbons
dark
hair
and
merry
faces
this
was
natasha
with
sonya
and
petya
who
had
come
to
see
whether
he
had
gotten
up
nikolenka
get
up
natashas
voice
was
again
heard
at
the
door
right
away
just
then
petya
glimpsing
the
sabers
in
the
adjoining
room
and
seizing
them
with
the
feeling
of
rapture
which
boys
experience
at
the
sight
of
a
military
older
brother
and
forgetting
that
it
was
improper
for
his
sisters
to
see
undressed
men
opened
the
door
is
this
your
saber
he
shouted
the
girls
jumped
away
denisov
with
frightened
eyes
hid
his
shaggy
legs
under
the
blanket
glancing
at
his
friend
for
help
the
door
admitted
petya
and
closed
again
behind
the
door
there
was
laughter
nikolenka
come
out
in
your
dressing
gown
said
natashas
voice
is
this
your
saber
asked
petya
or
is
it
yours
he
turned
to
the
mustached
black
denisov
with
obsequious
respect
rostov
hastily
put
on
his
shoes
his
dressing
gown
and
went
out
natasha
had
put
on
one
spurred
boot
and
was
getting
into
the
other
sonya
was
twirling
and
was
just
about
to
balloon
her
dress
and
crouch
down
when
he
came
in
the
two
girls
in
identical
new
light
blue
dresses
were
fresh
redcheeked
merry
sonya
ran
away
but
natasha
taking
her
brother
under
the
arm
led
him
to
the
sitting
room
and
started
talking
with
him
they
hastened
to
ask
and
answer
each
other
about
a
thousand
little
things
that
could
interest
only
them
natasha
laughed
at
every
word
he
said
and
she
saidnot
because
what
they
were
saying
was
funny
but
because
she
felt
merry
and
was
unable
to
hold
back
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
in
laughter
ah
how
good
excellent
she
added
after
every
word
rostov
felt
how
his
face
and
soul
expanded
under
the
influence
of
these
hot
rays
of
natashas
love
for
the
first
time
in
a
year
and
a
half
into
that
childish
and
pure
smile
which
he
had
not
once
smiled
since
he
left
home
no
listen
she
said
youre
quite
a
man
now
im
terribly
glad

my
brother
she
touched
his
mustache
id
like
to
know
how
you

are
are
you
like

no
why

sonya
run
away
rostov
asked
ah

whole
other
story

to
address
sonya
as

rostov

later
but
what
well
then
ill
tell
you
now
you
know
that
sonyas
my
friend
such
a
friend
that
id
burn
my
arm
for
her
look
here
she
pushed
up
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
a
red
mark
on
her
long
thin
and
delicate
arm
below
the
shoulder
but
far
above
the
elbow
where
it
is
covered
even
by
ball
gowns
i
burned
it
to
show
her
my
love
i
just
heated
a
ruler
in
the
fire
and
pressed
it
there
sitting
in
his
former
schoolroom
on
the
sofa
with
padded
armrests
and
looking
into
natashas
desperately
lively
eyes
rostov
again
entered
that
world
of
his
family
and
childhood
which
had
no
meaning
for
anyone
but
him
but
which
had
provided
him
with
one
of
the
best
enjoyments
in
life
and
the
burning
of
the
arm
with
a
ruler
to
show
love
did
not
seem
nonsense
to
him
he
understood
and
was
not
surprised
at
it
so
what
then
he
merely
asked
well
were
such
friends
such
friends
this
is
just
sillinessthe
ruler
but
were
friends
forever
if
she
loves
someone
its
forever
i
dont
understand
it
i
forget
at
once
well
so
what
well
so
she
loves
me
and
you
natasha
suddenly
blushed
well
you
remember
before
you
leftso
she
says
you
should
forget
it
allshe
said
ill
always
love
him
but
let
him
be
free
thats
excellent
excellent
and
noble
isnt
it
right
right
very
noble
right
natasha
asked
so
earnestly
and
excitedly
that
it
was
clear
that
what
she
was
saying
now
she
had
said
before
through
tears
rostov
pondered
i
dont
take
back
my
word
in
anything
he
said
and
besides
sonya
is
so
lovelywhat
fool
would
renounce
his
happiness
no
no
cried
natasha
she
and
i
already
talked
about
it
we
knew
youd
say
that
but
its
impossible
because
you
see
if
you
say
thatif
you
consider
yourself
bound
by
your
word
it
comes
out
as
if
shed
said
it
on
purpose
it
comes
out
as
if
youre
forced
to
marry
her
and
doesnt
come
out
right
at
all
rostov
saw
that
they
had
thought
it
out
very
well
sonya
had
already
struck
him
with
her
beauty
yesterday
today
having
glimpsed
her
fleetingly
he
thought
her
better
still
she
was
a
lovely
sixteenyearold
girl
obviously
passionately
in
love
with
him
he
did
not
doubt
it
for
a
moment
why
shouldnt
he
love
her
and
even
marry
her
thought
rostov
but
not
now
now
there
were
so
many
other
joys
and
things
to
do
yes
theyve
thought
it
out
splendidly
he
thought
i
should
remain
free
well
thats
splendid
he
said
well
talk
later
ah

so
glad
to
see
you
he
added
well
and
what
about

natasha
laughing

up
her
face

up
her
skirt
as

a
few
steps
turned
made
an
entrechat
tapped
her
foot
against
her
ankle
and
went
a
few
steps
on
the
very
tips
of
her
toes
see
me
standing
so
there
she
said
but
she
could
not
hold
it
thats
what
i
am
ill
never

a
dancer
only
dont
tell
anybody
rostov
laughed
so
loudly
and
merrily
that
denisov
felt
envious
in
his
room
and
natasha
unable
to
help
herself
laughed
with
him
no
but
its
nice
isnt
it
she
kept
saying
very
nice
so
you
no
longer

boris
natasha
blushed
i
dont

rostov

and
what

asked
yes

denisov

nicolas
no
vaskas
a
sweet
man
you
call
him
vaskastrange
and
what
is
he
very
nice
very
nice
well
come
quickly
and
have
tea
all
of
us
together
and
natasha
got
up
on
tiptoe
and
walked
out
of
the
room
as
ballet
dancers
do
but
smiling
as
only
happy
fifteenyearold
girls
do
meeting
sonya
in
the
drawing
room
rostov
blushed
he
did
not
know
how
to
treat
her
yesterday
they
had
kissed
each
other
in
the
first
moment
of
the
joy
of
meeting
but
today
he
felt
he
could
not
do
so
he
felt
that
all
of
them
his
mother
and
sisters
were
looking
at
him
questioningly
waiting
to
see
how
he
behaved
with
her
he
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
as
miss
sonya
but
their
eyes
met
without
any
formality
and
gave
each
other
a
tender
kiss
her
look
asked
forgiveness
for
daring
through
natashas
embassy
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
and
thanked
him
for
his
love
his
look
thanked
her
for
the
offer
of
freedom
and
said
that
one
way
or
another
he
would
never
stop
loving
her
because
it
was
impossible
not
to
love
her
how
strange
it
is
though
said
vera
finding
a
moment
of
general
silence
that
sonya
and
nikolenka
now
treat
each
other
like
strangers
on
formal
terms
veras
observation
was
correct
as
were
all
her
observations
but
like
most
of
her
observations
this
one
made
everyone
feel
awkward
and
not
only
sonya
nikolai
and
natasha
but
even
the
old
countess
who
feared
that
her
sons
love
for
sonya
might
deprive
him
of
a
brilliant
match
blushed
like
a
girl
to
rostovs
surprise
denisov
in
a
new
uniform
pomaded
and
perfumed
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
looking
as
dashing
as
he
did
in
battle
and
more
of
an
amiable
ladies
man
than
rostov
had
ever
expected
to
see
him
ii
having
returned
to
moscow
from
the
army
nikolai
rostov
was
received
by
all
the
family
as
the
best
of
sons
a
hero
and
their
darling
nikolushka
by
relations
as
a
nice
agreeable
and
courteous
young
man
by
acquaintances
as
a
handsome
hussar
lieutenant
an
adroit
dancer
and
one
of
the
best
suitors
in
moscow
all
moscow
was
acquainted
with
the
rostovs
the
old
count
had
enough
money
that
year
because
all
the
estates
had
been
remortgaged
and
therefore
nikolushka
having
acquired
his
own
trotter
and
the
most
fashionable
riding
breeches
special
ones
such
as
no
one
in
moscow
yet
had
and
the
most
fashionable
boots
with
the
most
pointed
toes
and
small
silver
spurs
spent
his
time
very
gaily
rostov
on
returning
home
experienced
a
pleasant
feeling
after
measuring
himself
for
a
certain
time
against
the
old
conditions
of
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
grown
and
matured
greatly
despair
over
a
failed
examination
in
catechism
borrowing
money
from
gavrilo
for
a
cab
secret
kisses
with
sonyahe
remembered
it
all
as
childishness
from
which
he
was
immeasurably
far
removed
now
now
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
the
hussars
in
a
silvertrimmed
dolman
with
his
soldiers
st
george
preparing
his
trotter
for
a
race
together
with
wellknown
older
respectable
fanciers
he
had
a
lady
acquaintance
on
the
boulevard
whom
he
visited
in
the
evenings
he
led
the
mazurka
at
the
arkharovs
ball
talked
about
the
war
with
field
marshal
kamensky
visited
the
english
club
and
was
on
familiar
terms
with
a
fortyyearold
colonel
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
through
denisov
his
passion
for
the
sovereign
weakened
somewhat
in
moscow
since
he
did
not
see
him
during
that
time
but
all
the
same
he
often
told
about
the
sovereign
about
his
love
for
him
letting
it
be
felt
that
he
was
not
telling
all
that
there
was
something
else
in
his
feeling
for
the
sovereign
that
not
everyone
could
understand
and
he
shared
with
all
his
soul
the
general
feeling
at
that
time
in
moscow
of
adoration
for
the
emperor
alexander
pavlovich
who
in
moscow
at
that
time
was
given
the
nickname
of
angel
in
the
flesh
during
rostovs
short
stay
in
moscow
before
leaving
for
the
army
he
did
not
become
closer
but
on
the
contrary
drew
away
from
sonya
she
was
very
pretty
sweet
and
obviously
passionately
in
love
with
him
but
he
was
in
that
season
of
youth
when
one
seems
to
have
so
much
to
do
that
there
is
no
time
for
that
and
a
young
man
is
afraid
of
being
tied
downhe
cherishes
his
freedom
which
he
needs
for
many
other
things
when
he
thought
about
sonya
during
his
stay
in
moscow
he
said
to
himself
ah
there
will
be
and
there
are
many
many
like
her
somewhere
whom
i
dont
know
yet
ill
still
have
time
when
i
want
to
occupy
myself
with
love
but
right
now
im
busy
besides
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
humiliating
to
his
manliness
in
womens
society
he
went
to
balls
and
into
womens
society
pretending
that
he
was
doing
so
against
his
will
the
races
the
english
club
carousing
with
denisov
going
therethat
was
another
matter
it
was
suitable
to
a
dashing
hussar
at
the
beginning
of
march
the
old
count
ilya
andreevich
rostov
was
taken
up
with
arranging
a
dinner
at
the
english
club
in
honor
of
prince
bagration
the
count
walked
about
the
reception
hall
in
his
dressing
gown
giving
orders
to
the
club
manager
and
to
the
famous
feoktist
the
head
chef
of
the
english
club
about
asparagus
fresh
cucumbers
strawberries
veal
and
fish
for
prince
bagrations
dinner
the
count
had
been
a
member
and
trustee
of
the
club
since
the
day
it
was
founded
he
had
been
charged
by
the
club
with
arranging
the
celebration
for
bagration
because
few
men
could
arrange
a
feast
with
such
largesse
and
hospitality
and
especially
because
few
men
could
and
would
supply
their
own
money
if
it
was
needed
to
arrange
the
feast
the
chef
and
the
club
manager
listened
to
the
counts
orders
with
cheerful
faces
because
they
knew
that
with
him
as
with
no
one
else
could
they
profit
so
well
from
a
dinner
costing
several
thousand
so
mind
you
cockscombs
put
cockscombs
in
the
tortue
you
know
three
cold
sauces
then
the
chef
asked
the
count
pondered
not
less
than
threemayonnaise
for
one
he
said
counting
off
on
his
fingers
so
your
orders
are
to
take
the
big
sterlet
asked
the
manager
no
help
for
it
take
the
big
ones
since
thats
what
theyve
got
ah
dear
me
i
almost
forgot
we
must
have
one
more
entr233e
on
the
table
oh
mercy
he
clutched
his
head
whos
going
to
bring
flowers
mitenka
hey
mitenka
gallop
to
the
moscow
estate
mitenka
he
said
to
the
steward
who
came
in
on
hearing
his
call
gallop
to
the
moscow
estate
and
tell
maximka
the
gardener
to
prepare
the
corv233e
now
tell
him
to
bring
the
whole
conservatory
here
wrapped
in
felt
two
hundred
pots
must
be
here
by
friday
having
given
more
and
more
orders
of
various
kinds
he
was
on
his
way
to
rest
with
his
little
countess
but
remembered
another
necessary
thing
came
back
himself
brought
the
chef
and
the
manager
back
and
again
began
giving
orders
a
light
male
footstep
was
heard
at
the
door
a
jingle
of
spurs
and
the
young
count
came
in
handsome
ruddy
with
a
black
little
mustache
obviously
rested
and
pampered
by
his
peaceful
life
in
moscow
ah
my
dear
fellow
my
head
is
spinning
said
the
old
man
smiling
to
his
son
as
if
embarrassed
you
might
at
least
help
me
we
need
singers
i
have
musicians
but
shall
we
invite
some
gypsies
you
military
folk

papa

think
prince
bagration

less
fuss
preparing
for
the
battle
of
sch246ngraben
than
youre
doing
now
the
son
said
smiling
the
old
count
pretended
to
be
angry
yes
talk
go
ahead
and
the
count
turned
to
the
chef
who
with
an
intelligent
and
respectful
face
glanced
at
the
father
and
son
observantly
and
affectionately
how
about
these
young
ones
eh
feoktist
he
said
laughing
at
us
old
folk
why
your
excellency
all
they
want
is
to
eat
well
but
putting
it
all
together
and
serving
it
is
none
of
their
business
right
right
cried
the
count
and
merrily
seizing
his
son
by
both
hands
he
cried
ive
caught
you
now

to
do
take
the
sleigh
and
pair
and
go
to
bezukhov
and
tell
him

nikolai
asked
laughing
well
well
just
then
anna
mikhailovna
stepped
inaudibly
into
the
room
with
the
businesslike
preoccupied
and
at
the
same
time
meek
christian
look
that
never
left
her
though
anna
mikhailovna
found
the
count
in
his
dressing
gown
every
day
he
became
embarrassed
each
time
and
apologized
for
his
costume
he
did
so
now
as
well
never
mind
my
dear
count
she
said
closing
her
eyes
meekly
and
ill
go
to
bezukhovs
myself
she
said
young
bezukhov
has
arrived
and
well
now

his
conservatory

have
to
see
him
anyway
he
has
sent
me
a
letter
from
boris
thank
god
boris
is
with
the
staff
now
the
count
was
delighted
that
anna
mikhailovna
was
taking
on
his
errands
and
he
ordered
the
smaller
carriage
readied
for
her
tell
bezukhov
to
come
ill
put
his
name
down
is
he
with
his
wife
he
asked
anna
mikhailovna
raised
her
eyes
and
her
face
expressed
deep
sorrow
ah
my
friend
hes
very
unfortunate
she
said
if
what
weve
heard
is
true
its
terrible
and
could
we
have
thought
of
it
when
we
rejoiced
over
his
happiness
and
such
a
lofty
heavenly
soul
this
young
bezukhov
yes

all
my
soul

ill

comfort
as
far
as
it
depends
on
me
but
what
is
it
asked
both
rostovs
old
and
young
anna
mikhailovna
sighed
deeply
dolokhov
marya
ivanovnas
son
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
they
say
he
has
totally
compromised
her
he
introduced
him
invited
him
to
his
house
in
petersburg
and
nowshe
has
come
here
and
that
daredevil
after
her
said
anna
mikhailovna
wishing
to
express
her
sympathy
for
pierre
but
by
involuntary
intonations
and
a
half
smile
expressing
her
sympathy
for
the
daredevil
as
she
called
dolokhov
they
say
pierre
is
totally
crushed
by
his
grief
well
all
the
same
tell
him
to
come
to
the
clubit
will
distract
him
therell
be
a
sumptuous
feast
the
next
day
the
third
of
march
between
one
and
two
in
the
afternoon
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
members
of
the
english
club
and
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
at
dinner
the
dear
guest
and
hero
of
the
austrian
campaign
prince
bagration
at
first
when
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
was
received
moscow
was
thrown
into
perplexity
at
that
time
the
russians
were
so
used
to
victories
that
on
receiving
news
of
the
defeat
some
simply
did
not
believe
it
others
sought
to
explain
such
a
strange
occurrence
by
some
extraordinary
causes
in
the
english
club
where
all
that
was
elite
had
accurate
information
and
carried
weight
used
to
gather
nothing
was
said
in
december
when
news
began
to
come
in
about
the
war
and
the
last
battle
as
if
there
was
a
general
agreement
to
keep
silent
about
it
people
who
guided
conversation
such
as
count
rastopchin
prince
yuri
vladimirovich
dolgoruky
valuev
count
markov
and
prince
vyazemsky
did
not
appear
at
the
club
but
gathered
in
peoples
houses
in
their
intimate
circles
and
those
muscovites
who
spoke
with
the
voices
of
others
to
whom
count
ilya
andreevich
rostov
also
belonged
were
left
for
a
short
time
without
any
definite
opinion
on
the
matter
of
the
war
and
without
guidance
the
muscovites
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
that
to
discuss
this
bad
news
was
difficult
and
therefore
it
was
better
to
be
silent
but
after
a
while
just
as
the
jurors
emerge
from
the
conference
room
so
the
aces
appeared
again
creating
opinion
in
the
club
and
all
began
speaking
clearly
and
definitely
the
causes
had
been
found
for
that
unbelievable
unheardof
and
impossible
event
of
a
russian
defeat
and
everything
became
clear
and
in
all
corners
of
moscow
the
same
things
were
said
these
causes
were
the
treachery
of
the
austrians
the
bad
provisioning
of
the
troops
the
treachery
of
the
pole
przebyszewski
and
the
frenchman
langeron
the
inability
of
kutuzov
and
in
a
low
voice
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
the
sovereign
who
had
trusted
bad
and
worthless
people
but
the
troops
the
russian
troops
everyone
said
were
extraordinary
and
had
performed
miracles
of
courage
the
soldiers
the
officers
and
the
generals
were
heroes
but
the
hero
of
heroes
was
prince
bagration
who
won
fame
for
his
action
at
sch246ngraben
and
for
the
retreat
from
austerlitz
in
which
he
alone
had
led
his
column
in
order
and
for
a
whole
day
had
beaten
back
a
twicestronger
enemy
what
contributed
to
the
choice
of
bagration
as
hero
in
moscow
was
that
he
had
no
moscow
connections
and
was
an
outsider
in
his
person
honor
was
paid
to
the
simple
russian
fighting
soldier
without
connections
or
intrigues
and
still
associated
through
memories
of
the
italian
campaign
with
the
name
of
suvorov
besides
rendering
him
such
honors
was
the
best
way
of
showing
dislike
and
disapproval
of
kutuzov
if
there
were
no
bagration
il
faudrait
linventer
said
the
joker
shinshin
parodying
the
words
of
voltaire
no
one
spoke
of
kutuzov
and
some
denounced
him
in
whispers
calling
him
a
court
weathercock
and
an
old
satyr
all
over
moscow
they
repeated
the
words
of
prince
dolgorukov
paste
paste
and
you
get
pastedcomforting
himself
for
our
defeat
with
the
memory
of
previous
victories
and
repeated
the
words
of
rastopchin
that
french
soldiers
had
to
be
urged
into
battle
by
highflown
phrases
that
with
germans
you
had
to
reason
logically
persuading
them
that
it
was
more
dangerous
to
run
away
than
to
go
forward
but
that
russian
soldiers
only
had
to
be
held
back
and
begged
to
slow
down
on
all
sides
more
and
more
new
stories
were
heard
about
particular
examples
of
courage
shown
by
soldiers
and
officers
at
austerlitz
this
one
had
saved
a
standard
that
one
had
killed
five
frenchmen
that
one
had
loaded
five
cannons
singlehanded
it
was
even
said
of
berg
by
those
who
did
not
know
him
that
wounded
in
the
right
hand
he
had
taken
his
sword
in
his
left
and
forged
ahead
of
bolkonsky
nothing
was
said
and
only
those
who
knew
him
closely
regretted
that
he
had
died
early
leaving
his
pregnant
wife
with
his
eccentric
father
iii
on
the
third
of
march
the
drone
of
talking
voices
hung
in
all
the
rooms
of
the
english
club
and
like
bees
in
spring
the
members
and
guests
of
the
club
shuttled
back
and
forth
sat

came
together
and
dispersed
again
in
uniforms
tailcoats
and
some
even
in
powdered
wigs
and
kaftans
powdered
liveried
servants
in
stockings
and
buckled
shoes
stood
by
every
door
and
strained
to
catch
every
movement
of
the
guests
and
members
of
the
club
in
order
to
offer
their
services
the
majority
of
those
present
were
venerable
old
people
with
broad
selfconfident
faces
fat
fingers
firm
movements
and
voices
this
sort
of
guests
and
members
sat
in
their
known
habitual
places
and
met
together
in

were
denisov
rostov
and
dolokhov
who
had
again
become
an
officer
of
the
semyonovsky
regiment
on
the
faces
of
the
young
men
especially
the
military
there
was
an
expression
of
that
feeling
of
disdainful
deference
towards
the
old
men
which
seemed
to
say
to
the
older
generation
were
prepared
to
respect
and
honor
you
but
remember
all
the
same
that
the
future
is
ours
nesvitsky
was
there
as
an
old
member
of
the
club
pierre
who
on
his
wifes
orders
had
let
his
hair
grow
long
and
removed
his
spectacles
was
fashionably
dressed
but
walked
about
the
rooms
with
a
sad
and
dejected
air
as
everywhere
he
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
people
who
bowed
before
his
wealth
and
he
treated
them
with
a
habitual
lordliness
and
absentminded
disdain
by
his
age
he
should
have
been
with
the
young
people
but
by
his
wealth
and
connections
he
was
a
member
of
the
circle
of
old
venerable
guests
and
therefore
he
kept
going
from
one
circle
to
another
the
most
distinguished
old
men
were
at
the
centers
of
the
circles
deferentially
surrounded
even
by
strangers
who
came
to
listen
to
the
wellknown
people
big
circles
formed
around
count
rastopchin
valuev
and
naryshkin
rastopchin
was
telling
about
how
the
russians
had
been
overrun
by
the
fleeing
austrians
and
had
had
to
use
bayonets
to
make
their
way
through
the
fugitives
valuev
told
confidentially
that
uvarov
had
been
sent
from
petersburg
to
find
out
the
opinion
of
the
muscovites
about
austerlitz
in
the
third
circle
naryshkin
was
talking
about
the
meeting
of
the
austrian
council
of
war
in
which
suvorov
had
crowed
like
a
cock
in
response
to
some
austrian
generals
stupidity
shinshin
who
was
standing
there
was
about
to
make
a
joke
saying
that
kutuzov
had
been
unable
to
learn
even
that
simple
skillof
crowing
like
a
cockfrom
suvorov
but
the
old
men
gave
the
joker
a
stern
look
letting
him
feel
that
there
and
on
that
day
it
was
improper
to
speak
like
that
about

in

in
a

and

important
and
unimportant

by

he
addressed
a
little
old
man
who
was
passing
by
but
before
he
finished
the
greeting
everything
stirred
and
a
servant
came
running
with
a
frightened
face
and
announced
hes
here
there
was
a
ringing
of
bells
the
club
stewards
rushed
forward
scattered
through
different
rooms
the
guests
like
rye
shaken
in
a
shovel
came
together
in
one
heap
and
stopped
in
the
big
drawing
room
by
the
door
to
the
reception
hall
in
the
doorway
of
the
anteroom
bagration
appeared
without
his
hat
and
sword
which
as
was
customary
at
the
club
he
had
left
with
the
doorman
he
was
not
in
an
astrakhan
peaked
cap
with
a
whip
over
his
shoulder
as
rostov
had
seen
him
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
but
in
a
trim
new
uniform
with
russian
and
foreign
decorations
and
the
star
of
st
george
on
his
left
breast
he
had
evidently
had
his
hair
and
sidewhiskers
trimmed
just
before
the
dinner
which
changed
his
physiognomy
to
its
disadvantage
on
his
face
there
was
something
na239vely
festive
which
in
combination
with
his
firm
manly
features
even
gave
his
face
a
somewhat
comical
expression
bekleshov
and
fyodor
petrovich
uvarov
who
came
with
him
stopped
in
the
doorway
wishing
him
as
the
main
guest
to
go
ahead
of
them
bagration
was
embarrassed
not
wishing
to
take
advantage
of
their
courtesy
a
pause
in
the
doorway
ensued
and
bagration
finally
did
go
ahead
of
them
he
walked
over
the
parquet
of
the
reception
hall
bashfully
and
awkwardly
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
hands
it
was
easier
and
more
usual
for
him
to
walk
under
bullets
over
a
plowed
field
as
he
had
walked
ahead
of
the
kursky
regiment
at
sch246ngraben
the
stewards
met
him
at
the
first
door
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
about
the
joy
of
seeing
such
a
dear
guest
and
not
waiting
for
him
to
reply
and
as
if
taking
possession
of
him
surrounded
him
and
led
him
to
the
drawing
room
it
was
impossible
to
go
through
the
door
of
the
drawing
room
because
of
the
thronging
members
and
guests
who
pressed
against
each
other
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
bagration
as
of
a
rare
animal
over
each
others
shoulders

through

led
the

to
the
drawing

and
seated
them
on
the
middle
sofa
the
aces
the

most
respected
members
stood
around
the
new
arrivals
count
ilya
andreich
again
pushing
through
the
crowd
left
the
drawing
room
and
came
back
a
moment
later
with
another
steward
carrying
a
large
silver
platter
which
he
offered
to
prince
bagration
on
the
platter
lay
verses
composed
and
printed
in
honor
of
the
hero
seeing
the
platter
bagration
glanced
fearfully
around
as
if
looking
for
help
but
all
eyes
were
demanding
that
he
submit
feeling
himself
in
their
power
bagration
resolutely
took
the
platter
in
both
hands
and
looked
angrily
and
reproachfully
at
the
count
who
had
offered
it
to
him
someone
obligingly
took
the
platter
from
bagrations
hands
otherwise
he
seemed
prepared
to
hold
it
that
way
till
evening
and
go
to
the
table
with
it
and
drew
his
attention
to
the
verses
well
so
ill
read
them
bagration
seemed
to
say
and
fixing
his
weary
eyes
on
the
paper
he
began
to
read
with
a
concentrated
and
serious
look
the
author
himself
took
the
verses
from
him
and
began
to
read
prince

inclined
his
head
and
listened

count
ilya
andreich
glancing
angrily
at
the
author
who
went
on
reading
his
verses
bowed
before
bagration
they
all
stood
up
feeling
that
dinner
was
more
important
than
verses
and
again
bagration
went
ahead
of
everyone
to
the
table
he
was
seated
in
the
first
place
between
two
alexandersbekleshov
and
naryshkinwhich
also
made
reference
to
the
sovereigns
name
three
hundred
people
were
then
seated
in
the
dining
room
by
rank
and
importance
the
more
important
closer
to
the
guest
of
honor
as
naturally
as
water
flows
deeper
where
the
terrain
is
lower
just
before
dinner
count
ilya
andreich
introduced
his
son
to
the
prince
bagration
recognizing
him
spoke
a
few
incoherent
awkward
words
like
all
the
words
he
spoke
that
day
while
bagration
was
talking
with
his
son
count
ilya
andreich
looked
everyone
over
joyfully
and
proudly
nikolai
rostov
with
denisov
and
his
new
acquaintance
dolokhov
sat
together
almost
at
the
middle
of
the
table
opposite
them
sat
pierre
beside
prince
nesvitsky
count
ilya
andreich
sat
opposite
bagration
together
with
the
other
stewards
and
did
the
honors
for
prince
bagration
personifying
moscow
hospitality
in
himself
his
labors
had
not
gone
in
vain
the
dinnersboth
lenten
and
nonlentenwere
splendid
but
even
so
he
could
not
be
perfectly
at
ease
until
dinner
was
over
he
winked
to
the
barman
whispered
orders
to
the
servants
and
waited
not
without
anxiety
for
each
familiar
dish
everything
was
excellent
with
the
second
course
along
with
a
giant
sterlet
seeing
which
ilya
andreich
blushed
from
joy
and
bashfulness
the
servants
began
to
pop
corks
and
pour
champagne
after
the
fish
which
produced
a
certain
impression
count
ilya
andreich
exchanged
glances
with
the
other
stewards
therell
be
many
toasts
its
time
to
begin
he
whispered
and
taking
a
glass
in
his
hand
he
arose
everyone
fell
silent
and
waited
for
what
he
would
say
to
the
health
of
our
sovereign
emperor
he
cried
and
at
the
same
moment
his
kindly
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
of
joy
and
rapture
at
that
same
moment
the
thunder
of
victory
resound
was
played
they
all
rose
from
their
seats
and
shouted
hurrah
bagration
too
shouted
hurrah
in
the
same
voice
in
which
he
had
shouted
on
the
field
of
sch246ngraben
young
rostovs
rapturous
voice
could
be
heard
above
the
other
three
hundred
voices
he
was
almost
weeping
to
the
health
of
the
sovereign
emperor
he
cried
hurrah
emptying
his
glass
at
one
gulp
he
flung
it
on
the
floor
many
followed
his
example
and
the
loud
shouts
continued
for
a
long
time
when
the
voices
died
down
the
servants
cleared
away
the
broken
glass
and
everybody
began
to
take
their
seats
smiling
at
their
own
shouts
and
talking
among
themselves
count
ilya
andreevich
rose
again
glanced
at
the
little
note
that
lay
next
to
his
plate
and
pronounced
a
toast
to
the
health
of
the
hero
of
our
latest
campaign
prince
pyotr
ivanovich
bagration
and
again
the
counts
blue
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
hurrah
the
voices
of
the
three
hundred
guests
shouted
again
and
instead
of
music
a
choir
was
heard
singing
a
cantata
composed
by
pavel
ivanovich
kutuzov
vain
are
all
barriers
to
russians
in
us

all
enemies
will
be
at
our
feetetc
as
soon
as
the
choir
finished
more
and
more
new
toasts
followed
at
which
count
ilya
andreevich
grew
more
and
more
sentimental
and
more
glasses
were
smashed
and
more
shouts
were
heard
they
drank
to
the
health
of
bekleshov
naryshkin
uvarov
dolgorukov
apraksin
valuev
to
the
health
of
the
stewards
to
the
health
of
the
manager
to
the
health
of
all
the
members
of
the
club
to
the
health
of
all
the
guests
of
the
club
and
finally
separately
to
the
health
of
the
dinners
host
count
ilya
andreevich
at
this
toast
the
count
took
out
his
handkerchief
covered
his
face
and
burst
completely
into
tears
iv
pierre
was
sitting
across
from
dolokhov
and
nikolai
rostov
he
ate
a
lot
and
greedily
and
drank
a
lot
as
usual
but
those
who
knew
him
intimately
could
see
that
some
great
change
had
taken
place
in
him
that
day
he
was
silent
all
through
dinner
and
squinting
and
wincing
looked
around
him
or
fixing
his
eyes
with
a
completely
absentminded
air
rubbed
the
bridge
of
his
nose
with
his
finger
his
face
was
dejected
and
gloomy
he
seemed
to
see
and
hear
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
to
be
thinking
of
some
one
painful
and
unresolved
thing
this
unresolved
question
that
tormented
him
came
from
the
hints
of
the
young
princess
in
moscow
at
dolokhovs
intimacy
with
his
wife
and
from
an
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
which
said
with
the
mean
jocularity
of
all
anonymous
letters
that
he
saw
poorly
through
his
spectacles
and
that
his
wifes
liaison
with
dolokhov
was
a
secret
to
no
one
but
him
pierre
decidedly
did
not
believe
either
the
princesss
hints
or
the
letter
but
it
was
scary
for
him
now
to
look
at
dolokhov
who
was
sitting
in
front
of
him
each
time
his
gaze
chanced
to
meet
dolokhovs
handsome
insolent
eyes
pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
ugly
rise
up
in
his
soul
and
he
quickly
turned
away
involuntarily
recalling
all
his
wifes
past
and
her
relations
with
dolokhov
pierre
saw
clearly
that
what
was
said
in
the
letter
might
be
true
might
at
least
seem
true
if
it
had
not
concerned
his
wife
pierre
involuntarily
recalled
how
dolokhov
to
whom
everything
had
been
restored
after
the
campaign
had
returned
to
petersburg
and
come
to
see
him
using
his
relations
of
carousing
friendship
with
pierre
dolokhov
had
come
straight
to
his
house
and
pierre
had
put
him
up
and
lent
him
money
pierre
recalled
how
h233l232ne
smiling
had
expressed
her
displeasure
at
dolokhovs
living
in
their
house
and
how
dolokhov
had
cynically
praised
his
wifes
beauty
to
him
and
how
from
then
until
they
came
to
moscow
he
had
not
parted
from
them
for
a
minute
yes
hes
very
handsome
thought
pierre
i
know
him
for
him
there
would
be
a
special
charm
in
disgracing
my
name
and
laughing
at
me
precisely
because
i
solicited
for
him
took
him
in
and
helped
him
i
know
i
understand
what
salt
it
would
give
his
deceit
in
his
own
eyes
if
it
were
true
yes
if
it
were
true
but
i
dont
believe
it
i
have
no
right
to
and
cannot
believe
it
he
recalled
the
expression
dolokhovs
face
assumed
in
moments
when
cruelty
came
over
him
as
when
he
tied
the
policeman
to
the
bear
and
threw
him
into
the
water
or
when
he
challenged
a
man
to
a
duel
for
no
reason
or
killed
a
cabbys
horse
with
a
pistol
that
expression
was
often
on
dolokhovs
face
when
he
looked
at
him
yes
hes
a
duellist
thought
pierre
to
kill
a
man
is
nothing
to
him
he
must
think
everybodys
afraid
of
him
it
must
make
him
feel
good
he
must
think
im
also
afraid
of
him
and
in
fact
i
am
afraid
of
him
thought
pierre
and
again
at
these
thoughts
he
felt
something
frightful
and
ugly
rise
up
in
his
soul
dolokhov
denisov
and
rostov
now
sat
facing
pierre
and
seemed
very
merry
rostov
talked
merrily
with
his
two
friends
one
of
whom
was
a
dashing
hussar
the
other
a
notorious
duellist
and
scapegrace
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
mockingly
at
pierre
who
stood
out
at
this
dinner
because
of
his
concentrated
absentminded
massive
figure
rostov
looked
at
pierre
unkindly
first
because
in
his
hussars
eyes
pierre
was
a
rich
civilian
the
husband
of
a
beauty
and
generally
an
old
woman
second
because
pierre
in
his
concentrated
and
absentminded
mood
had
not
recognized
rostov
and
had
not
responded
to
his
bow
when
they
drank
to
the
sovereigns
health
pierre
being
deep
in
thought
did
not
rise
or
take
his
glass
whats
with
you
rostov
shouted
looking
at
him
with
rapturously
spiteful
eyes
dont
you
hear
to
the
health
of
the
sovereign
emperor
pierre
sighed
rose
obediently
drank
his
glass
and
waiting
for
everyone
to
sit
down
turned
to
rostov
with
his
kindly
smile
and
i
just
didnt
recognize
you
he
said
but
rostov
could
not
be
bothered
he
was
shouting
hurrah
why
dont
you
renew
your
acquaintance
dolokhov
said
to
rostov
hes
a
fool
god
help
him
said
rostov
we
must
cherish
the
husbands
of
pretty
women
said
denisov
pierre
did
not
hear
what
they
were
saying
but
he
knew
it
was
about
him
he
blushed
and
turned
away
well
now
to
the
health
of
beautiful
women
said
dolokhov
and
with
a
serious
expression
but
with
a
smile
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
turned
to
pierre
glass
in
hand
to
the
health
of
beautiful
women
petrusha
and
of
their
lovers
he
said
pierre
his
eyes
lowered
drank
from
his
glass
without
looking
at
dolokhov
or
answering
him
the
servant
who
was
handing
out
kutuzovs
cantata
laid
a
sheet
before
pierre
as
one
of
the
more
honored
guests
pierre
was
about
to
pick
it
up
but
dolokhov
leaned
across
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
began
to
read
it
pierre
looked
at
dolokhov
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
sank
the
something
terrible
and
ugly
that
had
sickened
him
during
dinner
rose
up
and
took
possession
of
him
he
leaned
his
entire
corpulent
body
across
the
table
dont
you
dare
take
it
he
cried
hearing
this
cry
and
seeing
to
whom
it
was
addressed
nesvitsky
and
pierres
neighbor
on
the
right
turned
fearfully
and
hastily
to
bezukhov
enough
enough
whats
wrong
frightened
voices
whispered
dolokhov
looked
at
pierre
with
his
light
merry
cruel
eyes
and
with
the
same
smile
as
if
saying
ah
this
is
what
i
like
i
wont
give
it
to
you
he
said
distinctly
pale
his
lip
trembling
pierre
tore
at
the
page
youyouare
a
scoundreli
challenge
you
he
said
and
having
moved
his
chair
back
he
got
up
from
the
table
the
very
second
he
did
so
and
uttered
those
words
he
felt
that
the
question
of
his
wifes
guilt
which
had
tormented
him
all
that
past
day
was
definitively
and
indubitably
resolved
in
the
affirmative
he
hated
her
and
was
severed
from
her
forever
in
spite
of
denisovs
pleas
that
rostov
not
get
involved
in
the
affair
rostov
agreed
to
be
dolokhovs
second
and
after
dinner
talked
over
the
conditions
of
the
duel
with
nesvitsky
bezukhovs
second
pierre
went
home
and
rostov
sat
in
the
club
with
dolokhov
and
denisov
till
late
in
the
evening
listening
to
the
gypsies
and
the
singers
so
till
tomorrow
in
sokolniki
said
dolokhov
taking
leave
of
rostov
on
the
porch
of
the
club
and
youre
calm
asked
rostov
dolokhov
stopped
look
ill
reveal
to
you
in
two
words
the
whole
secret
of
a
duel
if
youre
going
to
a
duel
and
you
write
your
will
and
tender
letters
to
your
parents
if
you
think
you
may
be
killed
youre
a
fool
and
are
certainly
lost
you
should
go
with
the
firm
intention
of
killing
him
as
quickly
and
certainly
as
possible
then
everythings
in
good
order
as
our
bear
hunter
in
kostroma
used
to
say
how
can
you
not
be
afraid
of
a
bear
hed
say
but
once
you
see
him
your
fear
goes
away
except
of
letting
him
escape
well
thats
how
i

demain
mon
cher
the
next
day
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
pierre
and
nesvitsky
arrived
at
the
sokolniki
woods
and
found
dolokhov
denisov
and
rostov
already
there
pierre
had
the
look
of
a
man
occupied
with
some
considerations
of
no
concern
to
the
present
affair
his
pinched
face
was
yellow
he
obviously
had
not
slept
that
night
he
looked
around
absentmindedly
and
winced
as
if
from
the
bright
sun
two
considerations
occupied
him
exclusively
the
guilt
of
his
wife
of
which
after
the
sleepless
night
not
the
least
doubt
remained
and
the
innocence
of
dolokhov
who
had
no
reason
whatever
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
man
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
maybe
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
place
thought
pierre
i
even
certainly
would
have
done
the
same
thing
why
this
duel
this
murder
either
ill
kill
him
or
hell
hit
me
in
the
head
in
the
elbow
in
the
knee
leave
here
run
away
bury
myself
somewhere
came
to
his
head
but
precisely
in
the
moments
when
such
thoughts
came
to
him
he
with
that
especially
calm
and
absentminded
air
which
inspired
respect
in
those
who
looked
at
him
would
ask
will
it
be
soon
are
we
ready
when
everything
was
ready
the
swords
stuck
in
the
snow
to
mark
the
barrier
to
which
they
had
to
walk
and
the
pistols
loaded
nesvitsky
came
over
to
pierre
i
would
not
be
fulfilling
my
duty
count
he
said
in
a
timid
voice
and
would
not
justify
the
trust
and
honor
you
have
shown
me
by
choosing
me
as
your
second
if
i
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
at
this
important
this
very
important
moment
i
think
this
affair
has
no
sufficient
grounds
and
is
not
worth
shedding
blood
overyou
were
wrong
you
lost
your
temper
ah
yes
terribly
stupid
said
pierre
then
allow
me
to
convey
your
regrets
and
im
certain
that
our
adversaries
will
agree
to
accept
your
apology
said
nesvitsky
like
the
other
participants
in
the
affair
and
like
everyone
in
similar
affairs
not
believing
that
things
would
go
so
far
as
an
actual
duel
you
know
count
its
much
more
noble
to
acknowledge
your
mistake
than
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
point
beyond
repairthere
was
no
offense
on
either
side
allow
me
to
talk
it
over
no
what
is
there
to
talk
about
said
pierre
it
makes
no
differenceso
are
we
ready
he
added
only
tell
me
where
am
i
to
go
and
where
am
i
to
shoot
he
said
with
an
unnaturally
meek
smile
he
took
the
pistol
in
his
hands
and
began
asking
how
to
pull
the
trigger
because
until
then
he
had
never
handled
a
pistol
something
he
did
not
want
to
admit
ah
yes
like
that
i
know
i
just
forgot
he
said
no
apologies
decidedly
nothing
dolokhov
replied
to
denisov
who
for
his
made
an
attempt
at
reconciliation
and
he
also
walked
to
the
designated
place
the
place
chosen
for
the
duel
was
some
eighty
paces
off
the
road
where
the
sleighs
had
been
left
in
a
small
clearing
in
the
pine
woods
covered
with
snow
wet
from
the
thaw
that
had
set
in
over
the
last
few
days
the
adversaries
stood
some
forty
paces
from
each
other
at
the
edges
of
the
clearing
nesvitsky
and
denisov
measuring
out
the
paces
left
tracks
imprinted
in
the
deep
wet
snow
from
the
places
where
they
were
standing
to
their
swords
marking
the
barrier
and
stuck
into
the
ground
ten
paces
apart
the
thaw
and
the
fog
persisted
at
a
distance
of
forty
paces
they
could
not
see
each
other
clearly
in
three
minutes
all
was
ready
and
still
they
were
slow
to
begin
everyone
was
silent
v
well
begin
said
dolokhov
lets
said
pierre
with
the
same
smile
it
was
becoming
frightening
it
was
obvious
that
the
affair
having
begun
so
lightly
could
no
longer
be
prevented
by
anything
that
it
was
going
on
by
itself
independently
of
mens
will
and
would
be
accomplished
denisov
first
went
to
the
barrier
and
announced
since
the
adversaries
have
refused
a
reconciliation
kindly
begin
take
your
pistols
and
at
the
word
three
start
walking
towards
each
other
oone
two
three
denisov
cried
out
angrily
and
stepped
aside
the
two
men
began
walking
over
the
imprinted
tracks
getting
closer
and
closer
and
recognizing
each
other
in
the
fog
the
adversaries
had
the
right
to
fire
at
any
time
while
coming
to
the
barrier
dolokhov
walked
slowly
without
raising
his
pistol
his
light
shining
blue
eyes
peering
into
his
adversarys
face
on
his
mouth
there
was
as
usual
the
semblance
of
a
smile
at
the
word
three
pierre
walked
forward
with
quick
steps
getting
off
the
beaten
track
and
stepping
into
the
untouched
snow
pierre
stretched
his
arm
out
and
held
the
pistol
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
killing
himself
with
it
he
carefully
put
his
left
hand
behind
him
because
he
would
have
liked
to
support
his
right
hand
with
it
and
he
knew
that
was
not
allowed
having
gone
some
six
paces
and
veered
off
the
track
into
the
snow
pierre
looked
down
at
his
feet
again
gave
a
quick
glance
at
dolokhov
and
pulling
his
finger
as
he
had
been
taught
fired
never
expecting
such
a
loud
noise
pierre
gave
a
start
then
smiled
at
his
own
impression
and
stood
still
the
smoke
especially
thick
because
of
the
fog
at
first
prevented
him
from
seeing
anything
but
the
other
shot
he
was
expecting
did
not
follow
all
he
could
hear
were
dolokhovs
hurrying
steps
then
his
figure
appeared
through
the
smoke
he
was
holding
one
hand
to
his
left
side
the
other
clutched
his
lowered
pistol
his
face
was
pale
rostov
ran
over
and
said
something
to
him
nno
dolokhov
said
through
his
teeth
no
its
not
over
and
taking
several
more
dipping
hobbling
steps
to
the
sword
he
fell
on
the
snow
beside
it
his
left
hand
was
bloody
he
wiped
it
on
his
coat
and
propped
himself
up
with
it
his
face
was
pale
frowning
and
trembled
kind
dolokhov
began
but
could
not
get
the
word
out
kindly
he
finished
with
effort
pierre
barely
holding
back
his
sobs
ran
towards
dolokhov
and
was
about
to
cross
the
space
separating
the
barriers
when
dolokhov
cried
to
the
barrier
and
pierre
realizing
what
it
was
about
stopped
at
his
sword
only
ten
paces
separated
them
dolokhov
lowered
his
head
to
the
snow
bit
at
it
greedily
raised
his
head
again
pulled
himself
together
tucked
his
legs
under
and
sat
up
trying
to
find
a
steady
point
of
balance
he
filled
his
mouth
with
cold
snow
and
sucked
on
it
his
lips
trembled
but
went
on
smiling
his
eyes
glittered
with
the
effort
and
the
anger
of
a
last
summoning
of
strength
he
raised
his
pistol
and
began
to
take
aim
turn
cover
yourself
with
the
pistol
said
nesvitsky
cover
yourself
even
denisov
could
not
help
crying
to
his
adversary
pierre
with
a
meek
smile
of
pity
and
regret
his
legs
and
arms
spread
helplessly
his
broad
chest
exposed
stood
before
dolokhov
and
looked
at
him
sorrowfully
denisov
rostov
and
nesvitsky
closed
their
eyes
the
shot
and
dolokhovs
angry
cry
came
simultaneously
missed
cried
dolokhov
and
strengthless
he
sprawled
face
down
on
the
snow
pierre
clutched
his
head
and
turning
around
walked
off
towards
the
woods
treading
on
the
untouched
snow
and
mouthing
incoherent
words
aloud
stupidstupid
deathlies
he
repeated
wincing
nesvitsky
stopped
him
and
took
him
home
rostov
and
denisov
drove
off
with
the
wounded
dolokhov
dolokhov
silent
his
eyes
closed
lay
in
the
sleigh
and
did
not
answer
a
word
to
the
questions
they
put
to
him
but
as
they
entered
moscow
he
suddenly
came
to
and
raising
his
head
with
difficulty
took
the
hand
of
rostov
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
rostov
was
struck
by
the
totally
altered
unexpectedly
and
rapturously
tender
expression
on
dolokhovs
face
well
so
how
do
you
feel
asked
rostov
rotten
but
thats
not
the
point
my
friend
said
dolokhov
in
a
halting
voice
where
are
we
were
in
moscow
i
know
never
mind
me
but
ive
killed
her
killedshe
wont
survive
it
she
wont
survive
who
asked
rostov
my
mother
my
mother
my
angel
my
adored
angel
my
mother
and
dolokhov
wept
pressing
rostovs
hand
when
he
had
calmed
down
a
little
he
explained
to
rostov
that
he
lived
with
his
mother
that
if
his
mother
saw
him
dying
she
wouldnt
survive
it
he
begged
rostov
to
go
and
prepare
her
rostov
went
on
ahead
to
carry
out
his
errand
and
to
his
great
surprise
discovered
that
dolokhov
this
rowdy
duellist
lived
in
moscow
with
his
old
mother
and
hunchbacked
sister
and
was
a
most
affectionate
son
and
brother
vi
of
late
pierre
had
rarely
seen
his
wife
alone
both
in
petersburg
and
in
moscow
their
house
was
constantly
full
of
guests
the
night
after
the
duel
he
did
not
go
to
his
bedroom
but
remained
as
he
often
did
in
his
fathers
enormous
study
the
same
in
which
old
count
bezukhov
had
died
tormenting
as
the
inner
work
of
the
previous
sleepless
night
had
been
still
more
tormenting
work
was
beginning
now
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
wanted
to
fall
asleep
in
order
to
forget
all
that
had
happened
to
him
but
he
could
not
do
it
such
a
storm
of
feelings
thoughts
and
memories
suddenly
arose
in
his
soul
that
he
not
only
could
not
sleep
but
could
not
stay
in
place
and
had
to
jump
up
from
the
sofa
and
pace
the
room
with
quick
steps
now
he
pictured
her
in
the
initial
time
of
their
marriage
with
bared
shoulders
and
weary
passionate
eyes
and
at
once
beside
her
he
pictured
dolokhovs
handsome
insolent
and
firmly
mocking
face
as
it
had
been
at
the
dinner
and
the
same
face
of
dolokhov
pale
trembling
and
suffering
as
it
had
been
when
he
turned
and
fell
on
the
snow
what
has
happened
he
asked
himself
i
killed
a
lover
yes
i
killed
my
wifes
lover
yes
it
happened
why
how
did
i
come
to
that
because
you
married
her
an
inner
voice
answered
but
what
am
i
to
blame
for
he
asked
for
having
married
her
without
loving
her
for
deceiving
both
myself
and
her
and
he
vividly
pictured
that
moment
after
supper
at
prince
vassilys
when
he
had
spoken
those
words
je
vous
aime
which
had
refused
to
come
out
of
him
its
all
because
of
that
i
felt
then
too
he
thought
i
felt
then
that
it
was
wrong
that
i
had
no
right
to
it
and
so
it
turned
out
he
recalled
their
honeymoon
and
blushed
at
the
recollection
especially
vivid
insulting
and
shameful
for
him
was
the
recollection
of
how
once
soon
after
his
marriage
he
had
come
from
his
bedroom
to
his
study
before
noon
wearing
a
silk
dressing
gown
and
in
his
study
had
found
his
head
steward
who
bowed
respectfully
looked
at
pierres
face
at
his
dressing
gown
and
smiled
slightly
as
if
expressing
with
this
smile
a
respectful
sympathy
for
his
employers
happiness
and
how
many
times
i
felt
proud
of
her
he
thought
proud
of
her
majestic
beauty
her
worldly
tact
proud
of
my
house
in
which
she
received
all
petersburg
proud
of
her
inaccessibility
and
beauty
so
this
is
what
i
was
proud
of
i
thought
then
that
i
didnt
understand
her
how
often
pondering
her
character
i
said
to
myself
that
i
was
to
blame
that
i
didnt
understand
her
didnt
understand
that
eternal
calm
contentment
and
lack
of
any
predilections
and
desires
and
the
whole
answer
was
in
this
terrible
word
that
she
is
a
depraved
woman
i
said
this
terrible
word
to
myself
and
everything
became
clear
anatole
would
come
to
borrow
money
from
her
and
would
kiss
her
bare
shoulders
she
didnt
give
him
the
money
but
allowed
him
to
kiss
her
her
father
joking
tried
to
arouse
her
jealousy
she
said
with
a
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
jealous
he
can
do
as
he
likes
she
said
of
me
i
asked
her
once
whether
she
felt
any
signs
of
pregnancy
she
laughed
scornfully
and
said
she
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
want
to
have
children
and
that
she
would
not
have
children
from
me
then
he
recalled
the
clarity
and
coarseness
of
thought
and
the
vulgarity
of
expression
typical
of
her
despite
her
upbringing
in
high
aristocratic
circles
im
not
such
a
foolgo
and
give
it
a
tryallez
vous
promener
she
used
to
say
often
looking
at
her
success
in
the
eyes
of
old
and
young
men
and
women
pierre
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
love
her
and
i
never
loved
her
pierre
said
to
himself
i
knew
she
was
a
depraved
woman
he
repeated
but
i
didnt
dare
admit
it
to
myself
and
now
dolokhovsitting
on
the
snow
with
a
forced
smile
maybe
dying
and
responding
to
my
regret
with
some
sort
of
swagger
pierre
was
one
of
those
people
who
despite
their
ostensible
weakness
of
character
as
it
is
called
do
not
seek
to
confide
their
grief
he
worked
over
his
grief
alone
with
himself
she
she
alone
is
to
blame
for
everything
everything
he
said
to
himself
but
what
of
it
why
did
i
bind
myself
to
her
why
did
i
say
that
je
vous
aime
to
her
which
was
a
lie
and
still
worse
than
a
lie
he
said
to
himself
im
to
blame
and
i
must
bearbut
what
the

louis
xvi
was
executed
for
being
as
they
said
dishonest
and
criminal
came
into
pierres
head
and
they
were
right
from
their
point
of
view
and
equally
right
were
those
who
died
a
martyrs
death
for
him
and
counted
him
among
the
saints
then
robespierre
was
executed
because
he
was
a
despot
whos
right
and
whos
wrong
no
one
youre
aliveso
live
tomorrow
youll
die
just
as
i
could
have
died
an
hour
ago
and
is
it
worth
suffering
when
theres
only
a
second
left
to
live
compared
with
eternity
but
the
moment
he
considered
himself
comforted
by
this
sort
of
reasoning
he
suddenly
pictured
her
in
those
moments
when
he
had
shown
her
his
insincere
love
most
intensely
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
and
he
had
to
get
up
again
and
move
about
and
break
and
tear
things
that
happened
to
be
within
his
reach
why
did
i
say
je
vous
aime
to
her
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
and
having
repeated
this
question
for
the
tenth
time
molieres
mais
que
diable
allaitil
faire
dans
cette
gal232re
came
to
his
head
and
he
laughed
at
himself
in
the
night
he
called
his
valet
and
told
him
to
pack
up
to
go
to
petersburg
he
could
not
remain
under
the
same
roof
with
her
he
could
not
imagine
how
he
was
going
to
speak
to
her
now
he
decided
that
he
would
go
the
next
day
and
leave
her
a
letter
in
which
he
would
announce
his
intention
to
her
forever
in
the
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
his
study
bringing
coffee
pierre
was
lying
asleep
on
the
sofa
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
he
woke
up
and
looked
around
fearfully
for
a
long
time
unable
to
understand
where
he
was
the
countess
told
me
to
ask
whether
your
excellency
is
at
home
said
the
valet
but
before
pierre
decided
on
what
answer
he
would
give
the
countess
herself
in
a
white
satin
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
silver
and
with
her
hair
done
up
simply
two
enormous
braids
wound
twice
around
her
lovely
head
en
diad232me
came
into
the
room
calmly
and
majestically
only
there
was
a
wrinkle
of
wrath
on
her
marble
and
slightly
prominent
forehead
with
her
allenduring
calm
she
refrained
from
speaking
in
front
of
the
valet
she
knew
about
the
duel
and
had
come
to
talk
about
it
she
waited
until
the
valet
set
down
the
coffee
and
went
out
pierre
looked
at
her
timidly
through
his
spectacles
and
as
a
hare
surrounded
by
hounds
presses
its
ears
back
and
goes
on
sitting
in
full
view
of
its
enemies
so
he
attempted
to
go
on
reading
but
he
felt
that
it
was
senseless
and
impossible
and
again
glanced
at
her
timidly
she
did
not
sit
down
and
looked
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
smile
waiting
for
the
valet
to
leave
what
is
this
what
have
you
done
i
ask
you
she
said
sternly
iwhat
i
said
pierre
what
a
brave
fellow
weve
got
here
well
answer
what
is
this
duel
what
did
you
want
to
prove
by
it
what
i
ask
you
pierre
shifted
heavily
on
the
sofa
opened
his
mouth
but
could
not
answer
since
you
dont
answer
ill
tell
you
h233l232ne
went
on
you

everything
youre

you

h233l232ne
laughed
that
dolokhov
is
my
lover
she
said
in
french
with
her
coarse
precision
of
speech
pronouncing
the
word
lover
like
any
other
word
and
you
believed
it
but
what
did
you
prove
by
it
what
did
you
prove
by
this
duel
that
youre
a
fool
que
vous
234tes
un

everybody
knew
that
anyway
what
will
it
lead
to
that
i
will
become
the
laughingstock
of
all
moscow
that
everyone
will
say
that
you
in
a
drunken
state
forgetting
yourself
challenged
to
a
duel
a
man
of
whom
you
were
groundlessly
jealous
h233l232ne
raised
her
voice
and
became
more
and
more
inspired
and
who
is
better
than
you
in
all
respects
hmhm
pierre
grunted
without
looking
at
her
or
stirring
any
limb
of
his
body
and
why
should
you
believe
that
he
is
my
loverwhy
because
i
like
his
company
if
you
were
more
intelligent
and
agreeable
id
prefer
yours
dont
speak
to
mei
beg
you
pierre
whispered
hoarsely
why
shouldnt
i
speak
i
can
speak
and
ill
say
boldly
that
there
are
few
wives
who
wouldnt
take
lovers
des
amants
with
a
husband
like
you
but
i
didnt
do
that
she
said
pierre
wanted
to
say
something
gave
her
a
strange
look
the
expression
of
which
she
did
not
understand
and
lay
back
again
he
was
suffering
physically
at
that
moment
there
was
a
tightness
in
his
chest
and
he
could
not
breathe
he
knew
he
had
to
do
something
to
stop
this
suffering
but
what
he
wanted
to
do
was
too
terrible
its
better
for
us
to
part
he
said
haltingly
well
part
if
you
please
but
only
if
you
give
me
a
fortune
said
h233l232neto
parthow
scary
pierre
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
and
staggering
rushed
at
her
ill
kill
you
he
shouted
and
with
a
strength
as
yet
unknown
to
him
he
seized
the
marble
slab
from
a
table
took
a
step
towards
her
and
swung
h233l232nes
face
became
frightful
she
shrieked
and
sprang
away
from
him
his
fathers
blood
told
in
him
pierre
felt
the
enthusiasm
and
enchantment
of
rage
he
threw
down
the
slab
broke
it
and
approaching
h233l232ne
with
widespread
arms
shouted
out
in
such
a
frightful
voice
that
everybody
in
the
house
was
terrified
on
hearing
this
shout
god
knows
what
pierre
would
have
done
at
that
moment
if
h233l232ne
had
not
run
out
of
the
room
a
week
later
pierre
gave
his
wife
power
of
attorney
for
the
management
of
all
his
estates
in
great
russia
which
formed
the
major
his
fortune
and
left
alone
for
petersburg
vii
two
months
had
gone
by
since
the
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
and
the
loss
of
prince
andrei
was
received
at
bald
hills
and
despite
all
the
letters
sent
through
the
embassy
despite
all
the
searches
his
body
had
not
been
found
nor
was
he
among
the
prisoners
worst
of
all
for
his
family
was
that
there
still
remained
a
hope
that
he
had
been
picked
up
by
the
local
populace
on
the
battlefield
and
might
be
lying
somewhere
recovering
or
dying
alone
among
strangers
unable
to
send
news
of
himself
in
the
newspapers
from
which
the
old
prince
had
first
learned
of
the
defeat
at
austerlitz
it
was
written
as
usual
quite
briefly
and
indefinitely
that
after
brilliant
battles
the
russians
had
been
forced
to
retreat
and
that
the
retreat
had
been
carried
out
in
perfect
order
from
this
official
report
the
old
prince
understood
that
the
russians
had
been
defeated
a
week
after
the
newspapers
brought
news
of
the
battle
of
austerlitz
came
a
letter
from
kutuzov
which
informed
the
prince
of
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
son
before
my
eyes
wrote
kutuzov
your
son
with
a
standard
in
his
hands
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
fell
as
a
hero
worthy
of
his
father
and
his
fatherland
to
the
general
regret
of
myself
and
the
entire
army
it
is
still
unknown
whether
he
is
alive
or
not
i
flatter
myself
and
you
with
the
hope
that
your
son
is
alive
for
otherwise
he
would
be
among
the
officers
found
on
the
battlefield
and
his
name
would
be
on
the
list
given
me
by
the
peace
envoys
having
received
this
news
late
in
the
evening
when
he
was
alone
in
his
study
the
old
prince
did
not
say
anything
to
anyone
as
usual
the
next
day
he
went
for
his
morning
walk
but
he
was
silent
with
the
steward
the
gardener
and
the
architect
and
though
he
looked
angry
he
said
nothing
to
anyone
when
princess
marya
came
into
his
study
at
the
usual
time
he
was
standing
and
working
at
his
lathe
but
as
usual
did
not
turn
to
her
ah
princess
marya
he
suddenly
said
unnaturally
and
threw
down
his
chisel
the
wheel
went
on
turning
by
inertia
princess
marya
long
remembered
the
dying
creak
of
the
wheel
which
merged
for
her
with
what
followed
after
princess
marya
moved
towards
him
saw
his
face
and
something
suddenly
sank
inside
her
her
eyes
ceased
to
see
clearly
by
her
fathers
face
not
sad
not
crushed
but
angry
and
working
itself
unnaturally
she
could
see
that
there
there
above
her
hanging
over
her
and
crushing
her
was
a
terrible
misfortune
the
worst
misfortune
in
life
one
she
had
not
yet
experienced
an
irreparable
inconceivable
misfortunethe
death
of
a
loved

said
the
graceless
awkward
princess
with
such
an
inexpressible
loveliness
of
sorrow
and
selfforgetfulness
that
her
father
could
not
endure
her
gaze
and
sobbing
turned
away
ive
received
news
hes
not
among
the
prisoners
and
not
among
the
dead
kutuzov
writes
he
cried
shrilly
as
if
wishing
to
drive
the
princess
away
with
this
cry
hes
been
killed
the
princess
did
not
fall
did
not
feel
faint
she
had
been
pale
to
begin
with
but
when
she
heard
these
words
her
face
changed
and
something
lit
up
in
her
luminous
beautiful
eyes
it
was
as
if
joy
the
supreme
joy
independent
of
the
sorrows
and
joys
of
this
world
poured
over
the
deep
sorrow
that
was
in
her
she
forgot
all
her
fear
of
her
father
went
up
to
him
took
him
by
the
hand
pulled
him
to
her
and
embraced

dry
sinewy
neck

the
princess
sank
strengthlessly
into
the
armchair
next
to
her
father
and
wept
she
now
saw
her
brother
at
the
moment
when
he
had
taken
leave
of
her
and
liza
with
his
tender
and
at
the
same
time
arrogant
air
saw
him
at
the
moment
when
tenderly
and
mockingly
he
had
put
on
the
little
icon
did
he
believe
did
he
repent
of
his
unbelief
was
he

asked

go

liza
ill
come
when
princess
marya
came
back
from
her
father
the
little
princess
was
sitting
over
her
work
and
she
looked
at
princess
marya
with
that
special
expression
of
an
inward
and
happily
serene
gaze
that
only
pregnant
women
have
it
was
clear
that
she
did
not
see
princess
marya
but
was
looking
deep
inside
herselfinto
something
happy
and
mysterious
that
was
being
accomplished
in
her
marie
she
said
leaving
the
embroidery
frame
and
throwing
herself
backwards
give
me
your
hand
she
took
the
princesss
hand
and
placed
it
on
her
belly
her
eyes
were
smiling
in
expectation
her
little
lip
with
its
mustache
rose
and
remained
raised
in
a
childishly
happy
way
princess
marya
knelt
before
her
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
sisterinlaws
dress
there
theredo
you
feel
it
its
so
strange
and
you
know
marie
ill
love
him
very
much
said
liza
looking
at
her
sisterinlaw
with
shining
happy
eyes
princess
marya
could
not
raise
her
head
she
was
weeping
whats
the

masha
never
mindi
just

sadsad
about

she
said
wiping
her
tears
on
her
sisterinlaws
knees
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
princess
marya
began
to
prepare
her
sisterinlaw
and
each
time
she
began
to
weep
these
tears
the
reason
for
which
the
little
princess
did
not
understand
alarmed
her
though
she
was
little
attentive
she
did
not
say
anything
but
glanced
around
anxiously
as
if
looking
for
something
before
dinner
the
old
prince
whom
she
had
always
been
afraid
of
came
into
her
room
now
with
an
especially
uneasy
angry
face
and
left
without
saying
a
word
she
looked
at
princess
marya
then
became
thoughtful
with
that
expression
of
inward
attention
that
pregnant
women
have
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
have
you
received
something
from
andrei
she
asked
no
you
know
its
still
too
early
for
any
news
but
mon
p232re
worries
and
im
frightened
so
theres
nothing
nothing
said
princess
marya
looking
firmly
at
her
sisterinlaw
with
her
luminous
eyes
she
had
decided
not
to
tell
her
and
persuaded
her
father
to
conceal
the
terrible
news
from
her
sisterinlaw
until
her
delivery
which
was
expected
any
day
princess
marya
and
the
old
prince
in
their
own
ways
bore
with
the
grief
and
concealed
it
the
old
prince
did
not
want
to
hope
he
decided
that
prince
andrei
had
been
killed
and
though
he
sent
an
official
to
austria
to
look
for
his
sons
traces
he
ordered
a
gravestone
for
him
in
moscow
which
he
intended
to
put
in
his
garden
and
told
everyone
that
his
son
had
been
killed
he
tried
to
go
on
with
his
old
way
of
life
unchanged
but
his
strength
failed
him
he
walked
less
ate
less
slept
less
and
grew
weaker
every
day
princess
marya
went
on
hoping
she
prayed
for
her
brother
as
for
one
of
the
living
and
expected
news
of
his
return
any
moment
viii
ma
bonne

the
little
princess
said
on
the
morning
of
the
nineteenth
of
march
and
her
mustached
little
lip
rose
by
old
habit
but
as
ever
since
the
day
the
terrible
news
had
been
received
there
had
been
sorrow
not
only
in
the
smiles
but
in
the
sounds
of
talk
even
in
the
footsteps
in
that
house
so
now
the
smile
of
the
little
princess
who
had
succumbed
to
the
general
moodthough
she
did
not
know
its
causewas
such
that
it
was
all
the
more
a
reminder
of
the
general
sorrow

one
of
the
maids

a
midwife
from
the
provincial
capital
who
had
already
been
living
at

hills
for

she
kissed
liza
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
ah
no
noand
besides
the
paleness
the
face
of
the
little
princess
showed
a
childish
fear
of
unavoidable
physical
suffering
non

que

dites
marie
dites
and
the
princess
wept
with
a
capricious
childs
suffering
even
shamming
somewhat
wringing
her
little
hands
the
princess
ran
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
marya
bogdanovna
oh

she
heard
behind
her
the
midwife

with
a
significantly
calm
face
rubbing
her
small
plump
white
hands

princess
marya
looking
at
the

her
pace

in
her
rooms
the
princess
heard
something
heavy
being
carried
she
peeked
outthe
servants
were
for
some
reason
carrying
a
leather
sofa
that
had
been
in
prince
andreis
study
there
was
something
solemn
and
quiet
in
the
carriers
faces
princess
marya
sat
alone
in
her
room
listening
to
the
noises
in
the
house
opening
her
door
from
time
to
time
when
someone
passed
by
and
watching
over
what
was
happening
in
the
corridor
several
women
passed
back
and
forth
there
with
soft
steps
glanced
at
the
princess
and
turned
away
from
her
she
did
not
dare
ask
anything
closed
her
door
returned
to
her
room
and
now
sat
in
her
armchair
now
took
her
prayer
book
now
knelt
before
the
icons
unfortunately
and
to
her
astonishment
she
felt
that
prayer
did
not
calm
her
agitation
suddenly
the
door
to
her
room
opened
quietly
and
her
old
nanny
praskovya
savishna
who
hardly
ever
came
to
her
room
because
the
old
prince
forbade
it
appeared
in
the
doorway
her
head
bound
with
a
kerchief
ive
come
to
sit
with
you
mashenka
said
the
nanny
and
here
ive
brought
the
princes
wedding
candles
to
light
before
the
saint
my
angel
she
said
sighing
ah
im
so
glad
nanny
god
is
merciful
dear
heart
the
nanny
lit
the
golddecorated
candles
in
front
of
the
icon
stand
and
sat
down
by
the
door
with
her
knitting
princess
marya
took
a
book
and
began
to
read
only
when
steps
or
voices
were
heard
they
looked
at
each
other
the
princess
fearfully
questioningly
and
the
nanny
soothingly
the
same
feeling
that
princess
marya
was
experiencing
as
she
sat
in
her
room
came
over
everyone
and
spread
to
all
ends
of
the
house
following
the
belief
that
the
less
people
know
about
the
suffering
of
a
woman
in
labor
the
less
she
suffers
everyone
tried
to
pretend
they
knew
nothing
no
one
spoke
of
it
but
a
the
usual
staidness
and
respectfulness
of
good
manners
that
prevailed
in
the
princes
house
one
could
see
a
sort
of
general
concern
a
softness
of
heart
and
the
awareness
of
something
great
inconceivable
that
was
being
accomplished
at
that
moment
no
laughter
was
heard
in
the
big
maids
room
in
the
footmens
quarters
the
men
all
sat
silently
ready
for
something
the
caretakers
did
not
sleep
and
had
splinters
and
candles
burning
the
old
prince
paced
his
study
stepping
on
his
heels
and
sent
tikhon
to
marya
bogdanovna
to
ask
what
news
just
say
the
prince
told
me
to
ask
what
news
and
come
and
tell
me
what
she
says
tell
the
prince
that
labor
has
begun
said
marya
bogdanovna
glancing
significantly
at
the
messenger
tikhon
went
and
told
him
very
well
said
the
prince
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
tikhon
did
not
hear
the
least
sound
from
the
study
after
that
a
little
later
tikhon
went
into
the
study
as
if
to
tend
to
the
candles
seeing
the
prince
lying
on
the
sofa
tikhon
looked
at
him
at
his
upset
face
shook
his
head
silently
went
over
to
him
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
and
went
out
without
tending
to
the
candles
or
saying
why
he
had
come
the
mystery
the
most
solemn
in
the
world
continued
to
be
accomplished
evening
passed
night
came
and
the
feeling
of
expectation
and
of
the
hearts
softness
before
the
inconceivable
did
not
diminish
but
heightened
no
one
slept
it
was
one
of
those
march
nights
when
it
is
as
if
winter
wants
to
claim
its
own
back
and
with
desperate
malice
pours
out
its
last
snows
and
storms
the
german
doctor
from
moscow
was
expected
any
moment
a
carriage
had
been
sent
for
him
to
the
turning
from
the
highway
to
the
country
road
and
mounted
men
with
lanterns
went
to
lead
him
along
the
bumpy
and
muddy
road
princess
marya
had
long
ago
abandoned
her
book
she
was
sitting
silently
her
luminous
eyes
fixed
on
her
nannys
wrinkled
face
familiar
to
her
in
the
smallest
detail
on
the
lock
of
gray
hair
that
strayed
from
under
her
kerchief
at
the
little
pouch
of
skin
that
hung
under
her
chin
the
nanny
savishna
holding
her
knitting
was
telling
in
a
low
voice
herself
not
hearing
or
understanding
the
words
the
story
she
had
told
a
hundred
times
about
how
the
late
princess
had
given
birth
to
princess
marya
in
kishinev
with
a
moldavian
peasant
woman
instead
of
a
midwife
with
gods
mercy
theres
no
need
for
any
dokhturs
she
said
suddenly
a
gust
of
wind
blew
open
the
poorly
latched
window
at
the
princes
behest
with
the
coming
of
the
larks
one
frame
of
the
double
windows
was
removed
in
each
room
sent
the
heavy
silk
curtain
fluttering
blew
in
cold
and
snow
and
put
out
the
candle
princess
marya
shuddered
the
nanny
set
her
knitting
down
went
to
the
window
leaned
out
and
began
snatching
at
the
open
window
frame
cold
wind
blew
about
the
ends
of
her
kerchief
and
her
stray
locks
of
gray
hair
princess
dearest
somebodys
driving
down
the
avenue
she
said
holding
the
frame
and
not
closing
it
with
lanterns
must
be
the
dokhtur
ah
my
god
thank
god
said
princess
marya
i
must
go
and
meet
him
he
doesnt
know
russian
princess
marya
threw
on
her
shawl
and
ran
to
meet
the
arrivals
as
she
went
down
the
hall
she
saw
through
the
window
a
carriage
with
lanterns
standing
by
the
porch
she
went
out
to
the
stairs
a
tallow
candle
stood
on
a
baluster
melting
in
the
wind
the
servant
filipp
with
an
alarmed
face
and
holding
another
candle
stood
below
on
the
first
landing
of
the
stairs
still
lower
around
the
turning
of
the
stairs
footsteps
in
warm
boots
could
be
heard
and
a
voice
that
seemed
familiar
to
princess
marya
was
saying
something
thank
god
said
the
voice
and
father
gone
to
bed
replied
the
voice
of
the
butler
demyan
who
was
already
downstairs
then
the
voice
said
something
else
demyan
made
some
reply
and
the
footsteps
in
warm
boots
began
to
approach
more
quickly
the
invisible
turning
of
the
stairs
its
andrei
thought
princess
marya
no
it
cant
be
it
would
be
too
extraordinary
she
thought
and
the
moment
she
thought
it
the
face
and
figure
of
prince
andrei
in
a
fur
coat
with
a
snowsprinkled
collar
appeared
on
the
landing
where
the
servant
stood
with
a
candle
yes
it
was
he
but
pale
and
thin
with
a
changed
strangely
softened
but
anxious
expression
on
his
face
he
came
up
the
stairs
and
embraced
his
sister
you
didnt
get
my
letter
he
asked
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
which
he
would
not
have
received
because
the
princess
was
unable
to
speak
he
went
back
and
together
with
the
accoucheur
who
came
in
behind
him
they
had
met
at
the
last
posting
station
came
upstairs
again
with
quick
steps
and
again
embraced
his
sister
what
fate
he
said
masha
dear
and
throwing
off
his
fur
coat
and
boots
he
went
to
his
wifes
rooms
ix
the
little
princess
lay
propped
on
pillows
in
a
white
cap
her
suffering
had
just
eased
locks
of
her
black
hair
curled
around
her
inflamed
sweaty
cheeks
her
rosy
lovely
little
mouth
with
its
little
lip
covered
with
fine
black
hair
was
open
and
she
was
smiling
joyfully
prince
andrei
came
into
the
room
and
stopped
before
her
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
lying
her
glittering
eyes
looking
childishly
frightened
and
anxious
rested
on
him
without
changing
expression
i
love
you
all
i
did
no
harm
to
anyone
why
am
i
suffering
help
me
her
expression
said
she
saw
her
husband
but
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
his
appearance
before
her
prince
andrei
went
around
the
sofa
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
my
darling
he
spoke
words
he
had
never
said
to
her
before
god
is
merciful
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
with
childlike
reproach
i
expected
help
from
you
and
theres
nothing
nothingyou
too
said
her
eyes
she
was
not
surprised
that
he
had
come
she
did
not
understand
that
he
had
come
his
coming
had
no
relation
to
her
suffering
and
its
relief
the
pain
started
again
and
marya
bogdanovna
advised
prince
andrei
to
leave
the
room
the
accoucheur
came
in
prince
andrei
left
and
meeting
princess
marya
went
up
to
her
again
they
spoke
in
whispers
but
the
conversation
stopped
every
other
minute
they
waited
and
listened
allez
mon
ami
said
princess
marya
prince
andrei
went
to
his
wife
again
and
sat
in
the
next
room
waiting
some
woman
came
out
of
the
room
with
a
frightened
face
and
became
embarrassed
on
seeing
prince
andrei
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
sat
that
way
for
several
minutes
pitiful
helplessly
animal
moans
came
from
behind
the
door
prince
andrei
got
up
went
to
the
door
and
wanted
to
open
it
someone
was
holding
the
door
you
mustnt
you
mustnt
a
frightened
voice
said
from
inside
he
started
pacing
the
room
the
cries
ceased
another
few
seconds
went
by
suddenly
a
terrible
crynot
her
cry
she
could
not
cry
like
thatcame
from
the
next
room
prince
andrei
rushed
to
the
door
the
cry
ceased
but
another
cry
was
heard
a
babys
cry
why
did
they
bring
a
baby
there
was
prince
andreis
first
thought
a
baby
what
babywhy
is
he
there
or
has
a
baby
been
born
when
he
suddenly
realized
all
the
joyful
meaning
of
that
cry
tears
choked
him
and
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
windowsill
he
wept
sobbing
as
children
weep
the
door
opened
the
doctor
his
shirtsleeves
rolled
up
without
his
frock
coat
pale
his
jaw
trembling
came
out
of
the
room
prince
andrei
turned
to
him
but
the
doctor
gave
him
a
bewildered
look
and
passed
by
without
saying
a
word
a
woman
ran
out
and
seeing
prince
andrei
hesitated
in
the
doorway
he
went
into
his
wifes
room
she
lay
dead
in
the
same
position
in
which
he
had
seen
her
five
minutes
before
and
despite
her
still
eyes
and
pale
cheeks
there
was
the
same
expression
on
that
lovely
timid
childish
face
with
its
lip
covered
with
fine
black
hair
i
loved
you
all
and
did
nothing
bad
to
anybody
and
what
have
you
done
to
me
ah
what
have
you
done
to
me
said
her
lovely
pitiful
dead
face
in
the
corner
something
small
and
red
snorted
and
squealed
in
marya
bogdanovnas
white
trembling
hands
two
hours
after
that
prince
andrei
went
into
his
fathers
study
with
quiet
steps
the
old
man
already
knew
everything
he
was
standing
just
by
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
the
old
man
silently
embraced
his
sons
neck
with
his
old
tough
arms
as
in
a
vise
and
burst
into
sobs
like
a
child
three
days
later
the
funeral
service
was
held
for
the
little
princess
and
in
bidding
farewell
to
her
prince
andrei
went
up
the
steps
to
the
coffin
she
had
the
same
face
in
the
coffin
though
her
eyes
were
closed
ah
what
have
you
done
to
me
it
kept
saying
and
prince
andrei
felt
that
something
snapped
in
his
soul
that
he
was
to
blame
for
something
he
could
neither
set
aright
nor
forget
he
was
unable
to
weep
the
old
man
also
came
and
kissed
her
waxen
little
hand
which
lay
calmly
over
the
other
hand
and
to
him
her
face
also
said
ah
what
is
it
that
you
have
done
to
me
and
why
and
the
old
man
turned
angrily
away
on
seeing
that
face
after
another
five
days
the
young
prince
nikolai
andreich
was
baptized
the
foster
mother
held
the
swaddling
clothes
up
with
her
chin
while
the
priest
anointed
the
boys
wrinkled
red
palms
and
feet
with
a
goose
feather
the
godfatherhis
grandfatherin
fear
of
dropping
him
shook
as
he
carried
the
infant
around
the
dented
tin
baptismal
font
and
then
handed
him
to
his
godmother
princess
marya
prince
andrei
his
heart
sinking
for
fear
they
would
drown
the
baby
sat
in
another
room
waiting
for
the
sacrament
to
be
over
he
looked
joyfully
at
the
baby
when
the
nanny
brought
him
out
to
him
and
nodded
approvingly
when
the
nanny
told
him
that
when
thrown
into
the
font
the
piece
of
wax
with
the
babys
hair
had
not
sunk
but
had
floated
in
the
font
x
rostovs
participation
in
the
duel
between
dolokhov
and
bezukhov
was
hushed
up
through
the
efforts
of
the
old
count
and
rostov
instead
of
being
demoted
as
he
expected
was
appointed
adjutant
to
the
governor
general
of
moscow
as
a
result
of
that
he
could
not
go
to
the
country
with
the
whole
family
but
remained
in
moscow
all
summer
with
his
new
duties
dolokhov
recovered
and
rostov
became
especially
close
to
him
during
the
time
of
his
convalescence
dolokhov
lay
ill
at
his
mothers
who
loved
him
passionately
and
tenderly
old
marya
ivanovna
came
to
love
rostov
for
his
friendship
with
fedya
and
often
spoke
with
him
about
her
son
yes
count
she
used
to
say
hes
too
noble
and
purehearted
for
the
depraved
world
of
our
time
no
one
loves
virtue
its
a
sty
in
everyones
eye
now
tell
me
count
was
it
fair
was
it
honest
on
bezukhovs
part
yet
fedya
in
his
nobility
loved
him
and
never
says
anything
bad
about
him
even
now
all
that
mischief
with
the
policeman
in
petersburg
some
sort
of
fools
play
didnt
they
do
it
together
why
nothing
happened
to
bezukhov
and
fedya
had
to
bear
it
all
on
his
shoulders
hes
had
to
bear
so
much
suppose
they
did
restore
him
but
how
could
they
not
i
dont
think
there
were
so
many
brave
sons
of
the
fatherland
like
him
there
and
nowthis
duel
do
these
people
have
any
feeling
any
honor
to
challenge
him
to
a
duel
knowing
hes
an
only
son
and
shoot
straight
at
him
its
a
good
thing
god
was
merciful
to
us
and
for
what
who
in
our
time
doesnt
have
love
affairs
why
if
he
was
so
jealousi
can
understandthen
he
should
have
let
him
feel
it
sooner
but
no
it
lasted
a
whole
year
and
so
he
challenged
him
to
a
duel
assuming
that
fedya
wouldnt
fight
because
he
owed
him
money
how
mean
how
vile
i
know
youve
understood
fedya
my
dear
count
thats
why
i
love
you
from
the
heart
believe
me
few
people
understand
him
hes
such
a
lofty
heavenly
soul
dolokhov
himself
during
his
convalescence
often
spoke
such
words
to
rostov
as
he
could
never
have
expected
from
him
people
consider
me
a
wicked
man
i
know
he
used
to
say
and
let
them
i
dont
care
about
anyone
except
those
i
love
but
those
i
love
i
love
so
much
that
id
give
my
life
for
them
and
the
rest
id
crush
if
they
stood
in
my
way
i
have
an
adored
a
priceless
mother
two
or
three
friends
you
among
them
and
to
the
rest
i
pay
attention
only
insofar
as
theyre
useful
or
harmful
and
almost
all
of
them
are
harmful
especially
women
yes
my
dear
heart
he
went
on
i
have
met
loving
noble
lofty
men
but
i
have
never
yet
met
any
women
who
werent
boughtwhether
countesses
or
kitchen
maids
i
have
never
yet
met
that
heavenly
purity
and
faithfulness
that
i
seek
in
a
woman
if
i
had
ever
found
such
a
woman
i
would
have
given
my
life
for
her
but
these
he
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
believe
me
if
i
still
value
my
life
its
only
because
i
still
hope
to
meet
the
heavenly
being
who
will
resurrect
purify
and
elevate
me
but
you
dont
understand
that
no
i
understand
very
well
replied
rostov
who
was
under
the
influence
of
his
new
friend
in
the
fall

to
moscow
at
the
beginning
of

that
nikolai
rostov
spent
in
moscow
was
one
of
the
happiest
and
merriest
for
him
and
his
whole
family
nikolai
attracted
many
young
men
to
his
parents
house
vera
was
a
beautiful
twentyyearold
girl
sonya
a
sixteenyearold
with
all
the
loveliness
of
a
justopened
flower
natasha
half
young
lady
half
child
now
childishly
funny
now
girlishly
bewitching
at
that
time
there
was
a
special
atmosphere
of
amorousness
in
the
rostovs
house
as
happens
in
a
house
where
there
are
very
nice
and
very
young
girls
every
young
man
who
came
to
the
rostovs
house
looking
at
these
young
susceptible
girlish
faces
always
smiling
at
something
probably
their
own
happiness
at
this
lively
rushing
about
listening
to
this
young
female
babble
incoherent
but
affectionate
towards
everyone
ready
for
anything
filled
with
hope
listening
to
these
incoherent
noises
now
of
singing
now
of
music
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
readiness
for
love
and
expectation
of
happiness
that
these
young
people
of
the
rostovs
house
themselves
experienced
among
the
young
men
introduced
by
rostov
one
of
the
first
was
dolokhov
whom
everyone
in
the
house
liked
with
the
exception
of
natasha
she
almost
quarreled
with
her
brother
over
dolokhov
she
insisted
that
he
was
a
wicked
man
that
in
his
duel
with
bezukhov
pierre
had
been
right
and
dolokhov
wrong
that
he
was
unpleasant
and
unnatural
theres
nothing
for
me
to
understand
natasha
cried
with
stubborn
willfulness
hes
wicked
and
unfeeling
i
do
like
your
denisov
and
hes
a
carouser
and
all
that
but
even
so
i
like
him
which
means
i
understand
i
dont
know
how
to
tell
you
he
has
it
all
calculated
and
i
dont
like
that
but
denisov
well
denisovs
something
else
replied
nikolai
making
it
clear
that
compared
with
dolokhov
even
denisov
was
nothing
you
should
understand
what
a
soul
dolokhov
has
you
should
see
him
with
his
mother
he
has
such
a
heart
well
that
i
dont
know
but
i
feel
awkward
with
him
and
do
you
know
that
hes
in
love
with
sonya
what
silliness
im
certain
youll
see
natashas
prediction
was
proving
true
dolokhov
who
did
not
like
the
society
of
women
began
to
frequent
their
house
and
the
question
of
whom
he
was
doing
it
for
was
soon
resolved
though
no
one
spoke
of
it
in
the
sense
that
he
was
doing
it
for
sonya
and
sonya
knew
it
though
she
would
never
have
dared
to
say
it
and
she
flushed
crimson
every
time
dolokhov
appeared
dolokhov
dined
frequently
with
the
rostovs
never
missed
a
play
when
they
went
and
attended
the
balls
for
adolescentes
at
iogels
where
the
rostovs
always
went
he
paid
most
attention
to
sonya
and
looked
at
her
with
such
eyes
that
not
only
was
she
unable
to
endure
that
gaze
without
turning
red
but
even
the
old
countess
and
natasha
blushed
when
they
noticed
it
it
was
clear
that
this
strong
strange
man
was
under
the
irresistible
influence
produced
on
him
by
this
darkhaired
graceful
girl
who
loved
another
rostov
noticed
something
new
between
dolokhov
and
sonya
but
he
did
not
define
for
himself
what
these
new
relations
were
theyre
all
in
love
with
somebody
he
thought
about
sonya
and
natasha
but
he
now
felt
less
at
ease
with
sonya
and
dolokhov
and
he
began
to
stay
away
from
home
more
often
with
the
fall
of
1806
everyone
again
began
talking
about
war
with
napoleon
with
still
greater
ardor
than
the
previous
year
a
recruitment
was
announced
not
only
of
ten
recruits
but
of
another
nine
fighting
men
per
thousand
bonapartius
was
anathematized
everywhere
and
around
moscow
the
only
talk
was
of
the
impending
war
for
the
rostov
family
all
the
interest
of
these
preparations
for
war
consisted
only
in
the
fact
that
nikolushka
absolutely
refused
to
remain
in
moscow
and
was
simply
waiting
for
the
end
of
denisovs
leave
in
order
to
go
with
him
to
their
regiment
after
the
holidays
the
impending
departure
not
only
did
not
hinder
his
merrymaking
but
even
encouraged
it
he
spent
most
of
the
time
away
from
home
at
dinners
evening
parties
and
balls
xi
on
the
third
day
of
christmas
nikolai
dined
at
home
which
had
rarely
happened
with
him
recently
this
was
an
official
farewell
dinner
because
he
and
denisov
would
be
leaving
for
their
regiment
after
epiphany
there
were
some
twenty
guests
at
dinner
dolokhov
and
denisov
among
them
never
had
the
amorous
air
in
the
rostovs
house
the
atmosphere
of
being
in
love
manifested
itself
so
strongly
as
during
these
festive
days
seize
the
moments
of
happiness
make
them
love
you
fall
in
love
yourself
that
is
the
only
real
thing
in
this
worldthe
rest
is
all
nonsense
and
that
is
the
one
thing
were
taken
up
with
here
said
this
atmosphere
nikolai
as
always
having
exhausted
two
pairs
of
horses
and
still
not
having
managed
to
get
to
all
the
places
he
had
to
go
and
to
which
he
had
been
invited
came
home
just
before
dinner
as
soon
as
he
came
in
he
noticed
and
felt
the
intensity
of
the
amorous
atmosphere
in
the
house
but
besides
that
he
noticed
a
strange
perplexity
prevailing
among
certain
members
of
the
company
sonya
dolokhov
and
the
old
countess
were
especially
perplexed
and
natasha
somewhat
nikolai
realized
that
something
must
have
happened
before
dinner
between
sonya
and
dolokhov
and
with
a
sensitivity
of
heart
all
his
own
he
treated
them
both
very
delicately
and
carefully
during
dinner
that
same
evening
of
the
third
day
of
the
feast
one
of
those
balls
was
to
take
place
that
iogel
a
dancing
master
gave
during
the
holidays
for
all
his
pupils
boys
and
girls
will
you
go
to
iogels
nikolenka
please
do
natasha
said
to
him
he
has
asked
you
specially
and
vassily
dmitrich
that
is
denisov
is
going
ill
go
anywhere
the
countess
orders
me
to
said
denisov
who
had
jokingly
placed
himself
on
the
footing
of
natashas
knight
in
the
rostovs
house
im
ready
to
dance
the
pas
de
ch226le
if
i
have
time
i
promised
to
be
at
the
arkharovs
soir233e
said
nikolai
and
you
he
turned
to
dolokhov
and
as
soon
as
he
asked
it
he
noticed
that
he
should
not
have
asked
yes
perhaps
dolokhov
answered
coldly
and
angrily
glancing
at
sonya
and
frowning
he
glanced
at
nikolai
exactly
as
he
had
looked
at
pierre
during
the
club
dinner
theres
something
here
thought
nikolai
and
still
more
convinced
of
his
conjecture
by
dolokhovs
departure
right
after
dinner
he
called
natasha
out
and
asked
what
it
was
and
ive
been
looking
for
you
said
natasha
running
out
to
him
i
kept
saying
it
and
you
refused
to
believe
me
she
said
triumphantly
he
proposed
to
sonya
little
as
nikolai
had
been
occupied
with
sonya
during
that
time
it
was
as
if
something
snapped
in
him
when
he
heard
it
dolokhov
was
a
decent
and
in
some
respects
a
brilliant
match
for
the
dowerless
orphan
sonya
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
countess
and
of
society
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
him
and
therefore
nikolais
first
feeling
when
he
heard
it
was
anger
at
sonya
he
was
preparing
to
say
splendid
and
of
course
she
must
forget
her
childish
promises
and
accept
the
proposal
but
before
he
had
time
to
say
it
can
you
imagine
she
refused
him
refused
him
altogether
said
natasha
she
said
she
loved
another
she
added
after
a
brief
pause
yes
my
sonya
couldnt
have
acted
otherwise
thought
nikolai
no
matter
how
much
mama
begged
her
she
refused
and
i
know
she
wont
change
once
shes
said
something
and
mama
begged
her
nikolai
said
with
reproach
yes
said
natasha
you
see
nikolenka
dont
be
angry
but
i
know
you
wont
marry
her
i
know
god
knows
how
but
i
know
for
certain
that
you
wont
marry
her
well
that
you
really
cant
know
said
nikolai
but
i
must
speak
with
her
what
a
delight
this
sonya
is
he
added
smiling
she
is
a
delight
ill
send
her
to
you
and
natasha
having
kissed
her
brother
ran
off
a
moment
later
sonya
came
in
frightened
bewildered
and
guilty
nikolai
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
it
was
the
first
time
during
his
visit
that
they
spoke
alone
and
about
their
love
sophie
he
said
timidly
at
first
then
more
and
more
boldly
if
you
want
to
refuse
not
only
a
brilliant
but
an
advantageous
match
but
hes
a
wonderful
noble
manhes
my
friend
sonya
interrupted
him
ive
already
refused
she
said
hurriedly
if
youve
refused
for
my
sake
im
afraid
i
sonya
interrupted
him
again
she
looked
at
him
with
a
pleading
frightened
gaze
nicolas
dont
say
that
to
me
she
said
no
i
must
maybe
its
suffisance
on
my
part
but
its
still
better
to
say
everything
if
you
refused
for
my
sake
i
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
love
you
i
think
more
than
anyone
thats
enough
for
me
sonya
said
blushing
no
but
i
have
fallen
in
love
and
will
fall
in
love
a
thousand
times
though
i
have
no
such
feeling
of
friendship
trust
and
love
for
anyone
but
you
besides
im
young
maman
doesnt
want
it
well
simply
i
dont
promise
anything
and
i
ask
you
to
think
about
dolokhovs
proposal
he
said
speaking
his
friends
name
with
difficulty
dont
say
that
to
me
i
dont
want
anything
i
love
you
as
a
brother
and
will
love
you
always
and
i
need
nothing
more
youre
an
angel
im
not
worthy
of
you
only
im
afraid
to
deceive
you
and
nikolai
kissed
her
hand
once
more
xii
the
balls
at
iogels
were
the
merriest
in
moscow
mothers
said
so
looking
at
their
adolescentes
performing
their
justlearned
pas
the
adolescentes
and
adolescents
said
so
themselves
dancing
until
they
dropped
grownup
girls
and
young
men
said
so
who
came
to
these
balls
thinking
they
were
condescending
and
found
the
best
of
merriment
in
them
that
year
two
matches
were
made
at
these
balls
the
two
pretty
gorchakov
princesses
found
fianc233s
and
got
married
and
this
added
still
more
to
the
reputation
of
these
balls
the
particuliarity
of
these
balls
was
that
there
was
no
host
or
hostess
there
was
the
goodnatured
iogel
scraping
the
parquet
by
all
the
rules
of
art
flitting
about
like
a
bit
of
down
receiving
tickets
for
lessons
from
his
pupils
another
thing
was
that
only
those
came
to
these
balls
who
wanted
to
dance
and
be
merry
the
way
thirteen
and
fourteenyearold
girls
do
who
put
on
long
gowns
for
the
first
time
all
of
them
with
rare
exceptions
were
or
seemed
pretty
so
rapturously
they
smiled
so
litup
were
their
eyes
sometimes
the
best
girl
pupils
even
danced
the
pas
de
ch226le
and
the
best
of
them
was
natasha
distinguished
by
her
gracefulness
but
at
this
last
ball
only
the
233cossaise
and
the
anglaise
were
danced
and
the
mazurka
which
was
just
coming
into
fashion
iogel
rented
the
ballroom
in
bezukhovs
house
and
the
ball
was
very
successful
as
everyone
said
there
were
many
pretty
girls
and
the
rostov
girls
were
among
the
best
they
were
both
especially
happy
and
gay
that
evening
sonya
proud
of
dolokhovs
proposal
of
her
refusal
and
of
the
talk
with
nikolai
started
twirling
while
she
was
still
at
home
not
letting
her
maid
do
up
her
braids
and
now
she
shone
all
through
with
impetuous
joy
natasha
no
less
proud
of
wearing
a
long
gown
for
the
first
time
at
a
real
ball
was
still
happier
the
two
girls
wore
white
muslin
gowns
with
pink
ribbons
natasha
fell
in
love
from
the
moment
she
entered
the
ballroom
she
was
not
in
love
with
anyone
in
particular
but
with
everyone
she
fell
in
love
with
whomever
she
looked
at
the
moment
she
looked
at
him
ah
how
nice
she
kept
saying
running
to
sonya
nikolai
and
denisov
walked
around
the
rooms
looking
at
the
dancers
benignly
and
patronizingly
how
pretty
she
is
shell
be
a
beauty
said
denisov
who
countess
natasha
replied
denisov
and
how
well
she
dances
what
race
he
said
again
after
some
silence
who
are
you
talking
about
your
sister
denisov
cried
angrily
rostov
smiled
mon
cher
comte
vous
234tes
lun
de
mes
meilleurs
233coliers
il
faut
que
vous
dansiez
said
little
iogel
coming
over
to
nikolai
voyez
combien
de
jolies
demoiselles
he
turned
with
the
same
request
to
denisov
who
was
also
his
former
pupil
non
mon
cher
je
ferai
tapisserie
said
denisov
dont
you
remember
what
poor
use
i
made
of
your
lessons
oh
no
iogel
hastened
to
reassure
him
you
were
merely
inattentive
but
you
had
the
ability
yes
you
had
the
ability
they
began
to
play
the
newly
fashionable
mazurka
nikolai
could
not
refuse
iogel
and
asked
sonya
to
dance
denisov
sat
down
with
the
old
ladies
and
his
elbow
propped
on
his
saber
his
foot
beating
time
told
some
merry
story
and
made
the
old
ladies
laugh
while
glancing
at
the
dancing
young
people
iogel
danced
in
the
lead
couple
with
natasha
his
pride
and
his
best
pupil
moving
his
feet
softly
delicately
in
his
little
boots
iogel
flew
down
the
ballroom
with
natasha
who
timidly
but
carefully
performed
her
pas
denisovs
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
and
he
beat
time
with
an
air
which
said
clearly
that
he
was
not
dancing
himself
only
because
he
did
not
want
to
not
because
he
could
not
in
the
middle
of
a
figure
he
called
out
to
rostov
who
was
just
passing
by
thats
not
it
at
all
he
said
is
that
a
polish
mazurka
but
she
dances
splendidly
knowing
that
denisov
was
famous
even
in
poland
for
his
skill
in
dancing
the
polish
mazurka
nikolai
ran
over
to
natasha
go
and
choose
denisov
you
should
see
him
dance
its
a
wonder
he
said
when
natashas
turn
came
again
she
got
up
and
stepping
quickly
in
her
beribboned
little
shoes
she
timidly
ran
alone
across
the
room
to
the
corner
where
denisov
was
sitting
she
saw
that
everyone
was
looking
at
her
and
waiting
nikolai
saw
that
denisov
and
natasha
were
having
a
smiling
argument
and
that
denisov
was
protesting
but
smiling
joyfully
he
ran
over
please
vassily
dmitrich
natasha
said
please
do
no
really
spare
me
countess
said
denisov
enough
now
vasya
said
nikolai
he
talks
to
me
like
vaska
the
cat
denisov
said
jokingly
ill
sing
for
you
all
evening
said
natasha
the
sorceress
she
does
whatever
she
likes
with
me
said
denisov
and
he
unbuckled
his
saber
he
came
out
from
behind
the
chairs
took
his
lady
firmly
by
the
hand
threw
back
his
head
and
advanced
his
foot
waiting
for
the
downbeat
only
on
horseback
and
in
the
mazurka
did
denisovs
small
stature
not
show
and
he
looked
like
the
fine
fellow
he
felt
himself
to
be
on
the
downbeat
he
gave
his
lady
a
victorious
and
jocular
sidelong
look
unexpectedly
stamped
his
foot
bounced
off
the
floor
springily
like
a
ball
and
flew
along
in
a
circle
drawing
his
lady
after
him
he
flew
inaudibly
across
half
the
room
on
one
leg
and
seeming
not
to
see
the
chairs
that
stood
before
him
raced
straight
for
them
but
suddenly
clanking
his
spurs
and
spreading
his
legs
he
stopped
on
his
heels
paused
like
that
for
a
second
tapped
his
feet
in
place
with
a
clanking
of
spurs
spun
quickly
then
tapping
his
right
ankle
with
his
left
foot
again
flew
along
in
a
circle
natasha
intuitively
guessed
what
he
was
about
to
do
and
not
knowing
how
herself
followed
himgiving
herself
to
him
now
he
twirled
her
on
his
right
arm
now
on
his
left
now
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
led
her
around
him
then
jumped
up
and
sped
on
as
precipitously
as
if
he
intended
to
run
through
all
the
rooms
without
pausing
for
breath
now
he
suddenly
stopped
again
and
performed
a
new
and
unexpected
caper
when
he
swiftly
twirled
his
lady
in
front
of
her
seat
and
jingled
his
spurs
before
her
as
he
bowed
natasha
did
not
even
curtsey
to
him
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
in
perplexity
smiling
as
though
she
did
not
recognize
him
what
on
earth
is
this
she
said
even
though
iogel
did
not
acknowledge
this
mazurka
as
authentic
everyone
admired
denisovs
skill
began
choosing
him
constantly
and
the
old
men
smiling
began
to
talk
about
poland
and
the
good
old
days
denisov
flushed
from
the
mazurka
and
wiping
himself
with
a
handkerchief
sat
down
by
natasha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
whole
ball
xiii
for
two
days
after
that
rostov
did
not
see
dolokhov
at
his
house
and
could
not
find
him
at
home
on
the
third
day
he
received
a
note
from
him
since
i
do
not
intend
to
frequent
your
house
anymore
for
reasons
known
to
you
and
am
leaving
for
the
army
tonight
i
am
giving
a
farewell
party
for
my
friendscome
to
the
english
hotel
that
evening
after
nine
oclock
rostov
went
to
the
english
hotel
from
the
theater
where
he
had
been
with
his
family
and
denisov
he
was
brought
at
once
to
the
best
rooms
of
the
hotel
taken
for
the
night
by
dolokhov
some
twenty
men
crowded
around
the
table
at
which
dolokhov
sat
between
two
candles
on
the
table
lay
gold
and
banknotes
and
dolokhov
kept
the
bank
nikolai
had
not
seen
dolokhov
since
his
proposal
and
sonyas
refusal
and
he
felt
embarrassed
at
the
thought
of
how
they
would
meet
dolokhovs
light
cold
gaze
met
rostov
at
the
door
as
if
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
him
we
havent
seen
each
other
for
long
time
he
said
thank
you
for
coming
let
me
just
finish
the
game
and
ilyushka
will
come
with
the
chorus
i
called
at
your
place
rostov
said
blushing
dolokhov
did
not
reply
you
can
stake
he
said
rostov
remembered
at
that
moment
a
strange
conversation
he
had
once
had
with
dolokhov
only
fools
can
gamble
on
luck
dolokhov
had
said
then
or
are
you
afraid
to
play
with
me
dolokhov
said
now
as
if
guessing
rostovs
thought
and
he
smiled
behind
his
smile
rostov
saw
in
him
that
mood
he
had
been
in
during
the
dinner
at
the
club
and
generally
at
those
times
when
bored
with
everyday
life
dolokhov
felt
the
necessity
of
getting
out
of
it
by
some
strange
most
often
cruel
act
rostov
felt
awkward
he
sought
and
could
not
find
in
his
mind
a
joke
which
would
reply
to
dolokhovs
words
but
before
he
managed
to
do
it
dolokhov
looking
straight
in
rostovs
face
said
to
him
slowly
and
measuredly
so
that
everyone
could
hear
remember
we
talked
once
about
gamblinghes
a
fool
who
wants
to
gamble
on
luck
gambling
needs
certainty
but
i
want
to
try
it
try
gambling
on
luck
or
on
certainty
rostov
wondered
but
youd
better
not
gamble
dolokhov
added
and
flexing
a
newly
opened
deck
he
said
bank
gentlemen
moving
money
forward
dolokhov
prepared
to
keep
the
bank
rostov
sat
beside
him
and
at
first
did
not
play
dolokhov
kept
glancing
at
him
why
arent
you
playing
said
dolokhov
and
strangely
nikolai
felt
the
need
to
take
a
card
stake
an
insignificant
sum
on
it
and
begin
to
play
i
have
no
money
with
me
said
rostov
ill
trust
you
rostov
staked
five
roubles
and
lost
staked
once
more
and
lost
again
dolokhov
killedthat
is
wonten
cards
in
a
row
from
rostov
gentlemen
he
said
after
keeping
the
bank
for
a
while
i
ask
you
to
put
your
money
on
your
cards
otherwise
i
may
get
confused
in
the
accounting
one
of
the
players
said
he
had
hoped
he
could
be
trusted
that
i
can
do
but
im
afraid
to
get
confused
i
ask
you
to
put
money
on
the
cards
replied
dolokhov
and
dont
you
be
shy
well
settle
our
accounts
he
added
turning
to
rostov
the
game
went
on
a
servant
constantly
went
around
with
champagne
all
of
rostovs
cards
were
beaten
and
eight
hundred
roubles
were
already
scored
against
him
he
wrote
eight
hundred
rubles
on
a
card
but
while
champagne
was
served
to
him
he
changed
his
mind
and
again
wrote
an
ordinary
stake
twenty
rubles
leave
it
said
dolokhov
though
it
seemed
he
was
not
even
looking
at
rostov
youll
win
it
back
the
sooner
i
let
the
others
win
but
you
i
beat
or
are
you
afraid
of
me
he
repeated
rostov
obeyed
left
the
eight
hundred
as
written
and
laid
down
a
seven
of
hearts
with
a
torn
corner
that
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
he
remembered
it
very
well
afterwards
he
laid
down
the
seven
of
hearts
and
wrote
eight
hundred
above
it
with
a
piece
of
chalk
in
round
straight
figures
drank
the
glass
of
now
warm
champagne
that
had
been
served
him
smiled
at
dolokhovs
words
and
waiting
with
sinking
heart
for
a
seven
began
watching
dolokhovs
hands
which
held
the
deck
the
winning
or
losing
of
this
seven
meant
a
lot
to
rostov
last
sunday
count
ilya
andreich
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
rubles
and
he
who
never
liked
to
talk
about
money
problems
had
told
him
that
this
money
was
the
last
until
may
and
that
he
therefore
asked
his
son
to
be
more
economical
this
time
nikolai
had
said
that
it
was
even
too
much
for
him
and
on
his
word
of
honor
he
would
not
ask
for
more
money
until
spring
he
now
had
twelve
hundred
rubles
of
that
money
left
therefore
the
seven
of
hearts
meant
not
only
the
loss
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
but
the
necessity
of
breaking
his
word
with
sinking
heart
he
watched
dolokhovs
hands
and
thought
well
be
quick
deal
me
the
card
and
ill
take
my
cap
and
go
home
to
have
supper
with
denisov
natasha
and
sonya
and
will
certainly
never
touch
cards
again
at
that
moment
his
life
at
homejokes
with
petya
talks
with
sonya
duets
with
natasha
piquet
with
his
father
and
even
his
quiet
bed
in
the
house
on
povarskayapresented
itself
to
him
with
such
force
clarity
and
delight
as
though
it
were
all
a
long
past
lost
and
unappreciated
happiness
he
could
not
imagine
that
stupid
chance
making
the
seven
fall
to
the
right
rather
than
the
left
could
deprive
him
of
all
this
newly
understood
newly
illumined
happiness
and
cast
him
into
an
abyss
of
as
yet
unexperienced
and
undefined
misfortune
it
could
not
be
but
even
so
he
waited
with
sinking
heart
for
the
movement
of
dolokhovs
hands
those
broadboned
reddish
hands
with
hair
showing
from
under
the
cuffs
set
down
the
deck
of
cards
and
took
the
glass
and
pipe
that
had
been
served
him
so
youre
not
afraid
to
gamble
with
me
dolokhov
repeated
and
as
if
in
order
to
tell
a
merry
story
he
set
the
cards
down
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
with
a
smile
slowly
began
to
speak
yes
gentlemen
ive
been
told
theres
a
rumor
going
around
moscow
that
im
a
cardsharper
so
i
advise
you
to
be
more
careful
with
me
well
deal
then
said
rostov
ah
these
moscow
gossips
said
dolokhov
and
he
picked
up
the
cards
with
a
smile
ahh
rostov
nearly
cried
seizing
his
hair
with
both
hands
the
seven
he
needed
was
lying
on
top
the
first
card
in
the
deck
he
had
lost
more
than
he
could
pay
dont
overdo
it
though
said
dolokhov
with
a
fleeting
glance
at
rostov
and
he
went
on
dealing
xiv
an
hour
and
a
half
later
most
of
the
players
looked
upon
their
own
game
as
a
joke
the
whole
game
was
concentrated
on
rostov
alone
instead
of
sixteen
hundred
roubles
he
had
a
long
column
of
figures
scored
against
him
which
he
had
reckoned
up
to
ten
thousand
but
which
by
now
as
he
dimly
supposed
had
already
risen
to
fifteen
thousand
in
fact
the
score
already
exceeded
twenty
thousand
roubles
dolokhov
no
longer
listened
or
told
stories
he
watched
every
movement
of
rostovs
hands
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
quickly
through
his
score
he
had
decided
to
continue
playing
until
the
score
grew
to
fortythree
thousand
he
had
chosen
this
number
because
fortythree
made
up
the
sum
of
his
age
plus
sonyas
rostov
his
head
propped
in
both
hands
sat
at
the
writtenon
winestained
cardstrewn
table
one
tormenting
impression
would
not
leave
him
those
broadboned
reddish
hands
with
hair
showing
from
under
the
cuffs
those
hands
which
he
loved
and
hated
and
which
held
him
in
their
power
six
hundred
roubles
ace
corner
ninei
cant
win
it
all
backand
how
cheerful
it
would
be
at
homea
jack
ah
noit
cant
beand
why
is
he
doing
this
to
me
rostov
thought
and
tried
to
recall
occasionally
he
staked
a
large
sum
but
dolokhov
refused
to
play
and
set
the
stake
himself
nikolai
obeyed
him
and
first
he
prayed
to
god
as
he
had
prayed
during
the
battle
on
the
amstetten
bridge
then
he
decided
that
the
first
card
that
came
to
hand
from
the
pile
of
bent
cards
under
the
table
would
be
the
one
to
save
him
then
he
counted
the
cords
on
his
jacket
and
chose
the
card
with
the
same
number
to
stake
against
his
entire
loss
then
he
looked
at
the
other
players
for
help
then
he
peered
into
the
now
cold
face
of
dolokhov
and
tried
to
figure
out
what
was
going
on
in
him
he
does
know
what
this
loss
means
to
me
he
said
to
himself
can
he
really
wish
for
my
ruin
he
used
to
be
my
friend
i
loved
himbut
its
not
his
fault
either
what
can
he
do
if
hes
in
luck
nor
is
it
my
fault
he
said
to
himself
ive
done
nothing
wrong
did
i
kill
anyone
insult
or
wish
evil
to
anyone
why
then
such
a
terrible
misfortune
and
when
did
it
start
just
now
when
i
came
to
this
table
wishing
to
win
a
hundred
roubles
to
buy
that
sewing
box
for
mamas
birthday
and
go
home
i
was
so
happy
so
free
so
cheerful
and
i
didnt
realize
then
how
happy
i
was
when
did
it
end
and
when
did
this
new
terrible
condition
begin
what
marked
the
change
i
kept
sitting
in
the
same
way
in
this
place
at
this
table
choosing
cards
and
playing
them
and
watching
those
broadboned
deft
hands
when
did
it
happen
and
what
has
happened
im
healthy
strong
im
the
same
and
in
the
same
place
no
it
cant
be
surely
it
will
all
come
to
nothing
he
was
red
all
in
a
sweat
though
it
was
not
hot
in
the
room
and
his
face
was
frightful
and
pitiful
especially
in
its
impotent
desire
to
seem
calm
the
score
reached
the
fateful
number
of
fortythree
thousand
rostov
prepared
a
card
which
was
to
go
corners
on
the
three
thousand
just
given
him
when
dolokhov
tapped
the
deck
on
the
table
set
it
aside
and
taking
the
chalk
quickly
began
in
his
clear
strong
hand
breaking
the
piece
of
chalk
to
add
up
rostovs
score
supper
time
for
supper
the
gypsies
are
here
indeed
some
darkhaired
men
and
women
saying
something
with
a
gypsy
accent
were
already
coming
in
from
the
cold
nikolai
knew
it
was
all
over
but
he
said
in
an
indifferent
voice
so
you
wont
go
on
and
i
had
a
nice
card
ready
as
if
he
was
most
interested
in
the
amusement
of
the
game
itself
its
all
over
im
lost
he
thought
a
bullet
in
the
head
is
all
thats
left
to
me
and
at
the
same
time
he
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
well
one
more
little
card
all
right
said
dolokhov
having
finished
reckoning
all
right
ill
go
twentyone
roubles
he
said
pointing
to
the
difference
of
twentyone
roubles
over
the
exact
sum
of
fortythree
thousand
and
taking
the
deck
prepared
to
deal
rostov
obediently
unbent
the
corner
and
instead
of
the
six
thousand
he
had
prepared
carefully
wrote
twentyone
its
all
the
same
to
me
he
said
im
just
curious
to
know
whether
youll
kill
this
ten
or
let
me
win
it
dolokhov
gravely
began
to
deal
oh
how
rostov
hated
at
that
moment
those
reddish
hands
with
their
short
fingers
and
the
hair
sticking
out
from
the
cuffs
which
had
him
in
their
powerhe
won
the
ten
you
owe
me
fortythree
thousand
count
said
dolokhov
and
he
stood
up
from
the
table
and
stretched
its
tiring
though
to
sit
so
long
he
said
yes
im
tired
too
said
rostov
dolokhov
as
if
to
remind
him
that
it
was
unsuitable
for
him
to
joke
interrupted
him
when
will
i
get
the
money
count
if
you
please
rostov
flushed
and
invited
dolokhov
to
another
room
i
cant
pay
it
all
i
suppose
youll
accept
a
promissory
note
he
said
listen
rostov
said
dolokhov
smiling
brightly
and
looking
into
nikolais
eyes
you
know
the
saying
lucky
in
love
unlucky
at
cards
your
cousins
in
love
with
you
i
know
it
oh
its
terrible
to
feel
myself
so
much
in
this
mans
power
thought
rostov
rostov
knew
what
a
blow
he
would
deal
to
his
father
to
his
mother
in
announcing
this
loss
he
knew
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
be
delivered
of
it
all
and
he
realized
that
dolokhov
knew
he
could
deliver
him
from
this
shame
and
grief
but
still
wanted
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
your
cousin
dolokhov
tried
to
begin
but
nikolai
interrupted
him
my
cousin
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
there
is
no
point
in
talking
about
her
he
cried
in
a
rage
so
when
will
i
get
it
asked
dolokhov
tomorrow
rostov
said
and
left
the
room
xv
to
say
tomorrow
and
keep
up
the
tone
of
propriety
was
not
difficult
but
to
come
home
alone
to
see
his
sisters
brother
mother
father
to
confess
and
ask
for
money
to
which
he
had
no
right
after
giving
his
word
of
honor
was
terrible
at
home
no
one
was
asleep
the
young
people
of
the
rostovs
house
having
come
back
from
the
theater
and
had
supper
were
sitting
by
the
clavichord
as
soon
as
nikolai
came
into
the
reception
room
he
was
enveloped
by
that
amorous
poetic
atmosphere
which
had
prevailed
in
their
house
that
winter
and
which
now
after
dolokhovs
proposal
and
iogels
ball
seemed
to
thicken
still
more
like
the
air
before
a
thunderstorm
over
sonya
and
natasha
sonya
and
natasha
in
the
light
blue
dresses
they
had
worn
to
the
theater
pretty
and
knowing
it
happy
smiling
stood
by
the
clavichord
vera
and
shinshin
were
playing
chess
in
the
drawing
room
the
old
countess
waiting
for
her
son
and
husband
was
playing
patience
with
an
old
gentlewoman
who
lived
in
their
house
denisov
eyes
shining
and
hair
disheveled
was
sitting
his
leg
thrust
back
at
the
clavichord
banging
out
chords
on
it
with
his
stubby
fingers
and
his
eyes
rolling
was
singing
in
his
small
hoarse
but
true
voice
some
verses
of
his
own
composition
the
sorceress
which
he
was
trying
to
set
to
music
sorceress
tell
me
by
what
art
thou
drawest
me
to
abandoned
strings
what
fire
has
thou
instilled
in
my
heart
what
rapture
through
my
fingers
sings
he
sang
in
a
passionate
voice
his
agateblack
eyes
flashing
at
the
frightened
and
happy
natasha
splendid
excellent
cried
natasha
another
stanza
she
said
not
noticing
nikolai
for
them
everythings
the
same
thought
nikolai
peeking
into
the
drawing
room
where
he
saw
vera
and
his
mother
with
the
little
old
lady

said
sonya

to
me
my
dearest
the
countesss
voice
came
from
the
drawing
room
nikolai
went
over
to
his
mother
kissed
her
hand
silently
sat
down
at
her
table
and
began
watching
her
hands
which
were
laying
out
cards
from
the
reception
room
came
laughter
and
merry
voices
persuading
natasha
well
all
right
all
right
cried
denisov
now
theres
no
getting
out
of
it
you
owe
us
a
barcarolle
i
beg
you
the
countess
glanced
at
her
silent
son
whats
the
matter
the
mother
asked
nikolai
oh
nothing
he
said
as
if
he
was
already
sick
of
this
one
and
the
same
question
will
papa
come
soon
i
think
so
for
them
everythings
the
same
they
dont
know
anything
what
am
i
to
do
with
myself
thought
nikolai
and
he
went
back
to
the
reception
room
where
the
clavichord
stood
sonya
was
sitting
at
the
clavichord
and
playing
the
prelude
to
the
barcarolle
that
denisov
especially
liked
natasha
was
preparing
to
sing
denisov
was
looking
at
her
with
rapturous
eyes
nikolai
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
why
on
earth
make
her
sing
what
can
she
sing
theres
no
fun
in
it
at
all
thought
nikolai
sonya
played
the
first
chord
of
the
prelude
my
god
im
a
dishonest
lost
man
a
bullet
in
the
head
is
all
thats
left
for
me
not
singing
he
thought
go
away
but
where
never
mind
let
them
sing
nikolai
continuing
to
pace
the
room
glanced
gloomily
at
denisov
and
the
girls
avoiding
their
eyes
nikolenka
whats
the
matter
with
you
asked
sonyas
eyes
turned
to
him
she
saw
at
once
that
something
had
happened
to
him
nikolai
turned
away
from
her
natasha
with
her
sensitivity
also
instantly
noticed
her
brothers
state
she
noticed
it
but
she
felt
so
merry
herself
at
that
moment
she
was
so
far
from
grief
sorrow
reproach
that
she
purposely
deceived
herself
as
often
happens
with
young
people
no
im
too
merry
now
to
spoil
my
merriment
by
sympathy
for
someone
elses
grief
she
felt
and
said
to
herself
no
im
surely
mistaken
he
must
be
as
merry
as
i
am
well
sonya
she
said
and
went
out
to
the
very
middle
of
the
reception
room
where
in
her
opinion
the
resonance
was
best
raising
her
head
lowering
her
lifelessly
hanging
arms
as
dancers
do
natasha
made
a
few
energetic
steps
from
heel
to
toe
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stopped
here
i
am
she
seemed
to
be
saying
responding
to
the
rapturous
gaze
of
denisov
who
was
watching
her
whats
she
so
glad
about
thought
nikolai
looking
at
his
sister
how
is
it
shes
not
bored
and
ashamed
natasha
took
the
first
note
her
throat
expanded
her
chest
straightened
her
eyes
acquired
a
serious
expression
she
did
not
think
of
anyone
or
anything
at
that
moment
and
from
her
lips
composed
into
a
smile
sounds
poured
forth
sounds
that
anyone
can
produce
for
the
same
lengths
of
time
at
the
same
intervals
but
which
leave
one
cold
a
thousand
times
then
for
the
thousand
and
first
time
make
one
tremble
and
weep
that
winter
natasha
had
begun
to
sing
seriously
for
the
first
time
especially
because
denisov
admired
her
singing
she
no
longer
sang
like
a
child
there
was
none
of
that
comic
childish
assiduousness
in
her
singing
which
had
been
in
it
before
but
her
singing
was
not
good
yet
as
all
the
critical
connoisseurs
said
who
had
heard
her
sing
her
voice
has
no
polish
its
beautiful
but
it
needs
polish
they
all
said
but
they
usually
said
it
long
after
her
voice
had
fallen
silent
while
this
unpolished
voice
with
its
wrong
breathing
and
strained
transitions
was
singing
even
the
critical
connoisseurs
said
nothing
and
merely
enjoyed
this
unpolished
voice
merely
wanted
to
hear
it
again
her
voice
had
that
virgin
intact
quality
that
unawareness
of
its
strength
that
unpolished
velvetiness
which
were
so
combined
with
a
deficiency
in
the
art
of
singing
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
change
anything
in
this
voice
without
spoiling
it
what
on
earth
is
this
thought
nikolai
hearing
her
voice
and
opening
his
eyes
wide
whats
happened
with
her
how
she
sings
today
he
thought
and
suddenly
the
whole
world
became
concentrated
for
him
on
the
expectation
of
the
next
note
the
next
phrase
and
everything
in
the
world
became
divided
into
three
beats
oh
mio
crudele
affetto
one
two
threeone
twothreeoneoh
mio
crudele
affettoone
two
threeone
ah
our
foolish
life
thought
nikolai
all
this
misfortune
and
money
and
dolokhov
and
spite
and
honorits
all
nonsenseand
here
isthe
real
thingah
natasha
ah
darling
ah
dearesthow
is
she
going
to
take
this
bshe
did
it
thank
god
and
without
noticing
it
he
himself
was
singing
so
as
to
strengthen
that
b
taking
the
second
voice
a
third
below
the
high
note
my
god
how
beautiful
did
i
sing
that
what
happiness
he
thought
oh
how
that
third
had
vibrated
and
how
touched
was
something
that
was
best
in
rostovs
soul
and
that
something
was
independent
of
anything
in
the
world
and
higher
than
anything
in
the
world
what
are
gambling
losses
and
dolokhovs
and
words
of
honorits
all
nonsense
one
can
kill
and
steal
and
still
be
happy
xvi
it
was
long
since
rostov
had
experienced
such
enjoyment
from
music
as
on
that
day
but
as
soon
as
natasha
finished
her
barcarolle
reality
again
reminded
him
of
itself
saying
nothing
he
left
and
went
downstairs
to
his
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
old
count
merry
and
content
came
home
from
the
club
nikolai
hearing
him
come
went
to
him
well
did
you
have
a
good
time
asked
ilya
andreich
smiling
joyfully
and
proudly
at
his
son
nikolai
wanted
to
say
yes
but
could
not
he
all
but
burst
into
sobs
the
count
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
did
not
notice
his
sons
state
eh
its
inevitable
nikolai
thought
for
the
first
and
last
time
and
suddenly
in
the
most
casual
tone
which
made
him
seem
vile
to
himself
as
if
he
was
asking
for
a
carriage
in
order
to
go
to
town
he
said
to
his
father
papa
ive
come
on
business
i
nearly
forgot
i
need
money
well
now
said
his
father
who
was
in
an
especially
cheerful
mood
i
told
you
it
wouldnt
be
enough
how
much
very
much
said
nikolai
blushing
and
with
a
stupid
casual
smile
for
which
he
could
not
forgive
himself
for
a
long
time
afterwards
ive
lost
a
bit
at
cards
that
is
a
good
deal
even
a
very
great
deal
fortythree
thousand
what
to
whomyoure
joking
the
count
cried
his
neck
and
nape
suddenly
turning
an
apoplectic
red
as
happens
with
old
people
i
promised
to
pay
tomorrow
said
nikolai
well
said
the
old
count
spreading
his
arms
and
sinking
strengthlessly
onto
the
sofa
no
help
for
it
it
happens
to
everybody
his
son
said
in
a
careless
brazen
tone
while
in
his
soul
he
considered
himself
a
villain
a
scoundrel
whose
whole
life
would
not
be
enough
to
redeem
his
crime
he
would
have
liked
to
kiss
his
fathers
hands
to
go
to
his
knees
and
ask
forgiveness
yet
he
said
in
a
careless
and
even
rude
tone
that
it
happened
to
everybody
hearing
his
sons
words
count
ilya
andreich
lowered
his
eyes
and
began
fussing
about
as
if
looking
for
something
yes
yes
he
said
its
hard
im
afraid
its
hard
to
findit
happens
yes
it
happens
to
everybody
and
giving
his
son
a
fleeting
look
the
count
started
out
of
the
roomnikolai
had
been
prepared
for
a
rebuff
but
he
had
never
expected
this
papa
papa
he
cried
out
after
him
sobbing
forgive
me
and
seizing
his
fathers
hand
he
pressed
his
lips
to
it
and
wept
while
father
and
son
were
having
a
talk
a
no
less
important
talk
was
going
on
between
mother
and
daughter
natasha
excited

come
running
to
her
mother

recently

natasha
said
crossly
i

the
countess
shrugged
her
shoulders
if

proposed
to
you
ridiculous
as
it
is
tell
him

offended
and
serious
tone

countess

smiling

she
added
responding
to
her
smile
if

to

said
the
countess
indignant
that
someone
had
dared
to
consider
her
little
natasha
a
grownup
no
not
for
anything
ill
do
it
and
you
go
and
listen
at
the
door
and
natasha
ran
across
the
drawing
room
to
the
reception
room
where
denisov
was
sitting
on
the
same
chair
at
the
clavichord
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
at
the
sound
of
her
light
footsteps
he
jumped
up
natalie
he
said
going
to
her
with
quick
steps
decide
my
fate
it
is
in
your
hands
vassily
dmitrich
im
so
sorry
for
youno
but
youre
so
nicebut
you
mustntthatbut
ill
always
love
you
like
this
denisov
bent
over
her
hand
and
she
heard
strange
incomprehensible
sounds
she
kissed
him
on
his
black
tousled
curly
head
at
that
moment
there
was
a
hasty
rustle
of
the
countesss
skirts
she
went
up
to
them
vassily
dmitrich
i
thank
you
for
the
honor
the
countess
said
in
an
embarrassed
tone
which
seemed
stern
to
denisov
but
my
daughter
is
so
young
and
i
thought
that
you
as
my
sons
friend
would
have
addressed
me
first
in
that
case
you
would
not
have
brought
me
to
the
necessity
of
a
refusal
countess
said
denisov
with
lowered
eyes
and
a
guilty
look
and
he
was
about
to
say
something
more
but
faltered
natasha
could
not
calmly
see
him
so
pitiful
she
began
to
sob
loudly
countess
i
am
to
blame
before
you
denisov
went
on
in
a
halting
voice
but
know
that
i
adore
your
daughter
and
your
whole
family
so
much
that
i
would
give
two
lives
he
looked
at
the
countess
and
noticing
her
stern
facegoodbye
countess
he
said
kissed
her
hand
and
without
looking
at
natasha
with
quick
resolute
steps
left
the
room
the
next
day
rostov
saw
off
denisov
who
did
not
want
to
remain
in
moscow
a
day
longer
all
denisovs
moscow
friends
were
seeing
him
off
at
the
gypsies
and
he
did
not
remember
how
he
was
put
in
the
sleigh
and
driven
the
first
three
posting
stations
after
denisovs
departure
rostov
waiting
for
the
money
which
the
old
count
could
not
raise
all
at
once
spent
two
more
weeks
in
moscow
without
leaving
the
house
mostly
in
the
young
ladies
room
sonya
was
more
devoted
and
tender
to
him
than
ever
it
was
as
if
she
wanted
to
show
him
that
his
loss
at
cards
was
a
feat
which
made
her
love
him
still
more
but
nikolai
now
considered
himself
unworthy
of
her
he
covered
the
girls
albums
with
verses
and
music
and
without
taking
leave
of
any
of
his
acquaintances
having
finally
sent
off
the
entire
fortythree
thousand
and
received
dolokhovs
receipt
left
at
the
end
of
november
to
catch
up
with
his
regiment
which
was
already
in
poland
i
after
his
talk
with
his
wife
pierre
went
to
petersburg
at
the
torzhok
posting
station
there
were
no
horses
or
else
the
postmaster
did
not
want
to
give
them
to
him
pierre
had
to
wait
without
undressing
he
lay
down
on
a
leather
sofa
in
front
of
a
round
table
put
his
big
feet
in
their
warm
boots
on
the
table
and
lapsed
into
thought
would
you
like
to
have
the
suitcases
brought
in
would
you
like
to
have
the
bed
made
or
tea
served
asked
his
valet
pierre
did
not
reply
because
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
he
had
lapsed
into
thought
at
the
previous
station
and
went
on
thinking
about
the
same
thingso
important
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
happening
around
him
he
not
only
was
not
interested
in
whether
he
would
get
to
petersburg
sooner
or
later
or
whether
he
would
or
would
not
find
a
place
to
rest
in
this
station
but
compared
with
the
thoughts
that
occupied
him
then
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
he
spent
a
few
hours
or
his
whole
life
in
this
station
the
postmaster
his
wife
the
valet
a
peasant
woman
with
torzhok
embroidery
kept
coming
into
the
room
offering
their
services
pierre
not
changing
the
position
of
his
raised
legs
looked
at
them
through
his
spectacles
without
understanding
what
they
could
possibly
want
or
how
they
could
possibly
live
without
resolving
the
questions
that
occupied
him
and
he
had
been
occupied
with
the
same
questions
ever
since
the
day
when
he
came
back
from
sokolniki
after
the
duel
and
spent
the
first
tormenting
sleepless
night
only
now
in
the
solitude
of
the
journey
they
came
over
him
with
particular
force
whatever
he
started
thinking
about
he
came
back
to
the
same
questions
which
he
could
not
resolve
and
could
not
stop
asking
himself
it
was
as
if
the
main
screw
in
his
head
which
held
his
whole
life
together
had
become
stripped
the
screw
would
not
go
in
would
not
come
out
but
turned
in
the
same
groove
without
catching
hold
and
it
was
impossible
to
stop
turning
it
the
postmaster
came
in
and
humbly
began
asking
his
excellency
to
wait
only
two
little
hours
after
which
come
what
might
he
would
give
his
excellency
posthorses
the
postmaster
was
obviously
lying
and
only
wanted
to
get
extra
money
from
the
traveler
is
that
bad
or
is
it
good
pierre
asked
himself
for
me
its
good
for
some
other
traveler
it
would
be
bad
and
for
the
postmaster
its
inevitable
because
he
has
nothing
to
eat
he
says
an
officer
gave
him
a
thrashing
on
account
of
that
the
officer
gave
him
a
thrashing
because
he
had
to
leave
soon
and
i
shot
at
dolokhov
because
i
considered
myself
insulted
and
louis
xvi
was
executed
because
he
was
considered
a
criminal
and
a
year
later
those
who
executed
him
were
also
killed
for
something
what
is
bad
what
is
good
what
should
one
love
what
hate
why
live
and
what
am
i
what
is
life
what
is
death
what
power
rules
over
everything
he
asked
himself
and
there
was
no
answer
to
any
of
these
questions
except
one
which
was
not
logical
and
was
not
at
all
an
answer
to
these
questions
this
answer
was
you
will
dieand
everything
will
end
you
will
die
and
learn
everythingor
stop
asking
but
to
die
was
also
frightening
the
torzhok
peddler
woman
offered
him
her
wares
in
a
shrill
voice
especially
a
pair
of
goatskin
shoes
i
have
hundreds
of
roubles
that
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
and
she
stands
there
in
a
tattered
coat
and
looks
at
me
timidly
thought
pierre
and
what
does
she
need
the
money
for
as
if
this
money
can
add
one
hairs
breadth
to
her
happiness
her
peace
of
mind
can
anything
in
the
world
make
her
or
me
less
subject
to
evil
and
death
death
which
will
end
everything
and
which
must
come
today
or
tomorrowin
a
moment
anyhow
compared
with
eternity
and
he
again
put
pressure
on
the
stripped
screw
and
the
screw
kept
turning
in
one
and
the
same
place
his
servant
handed
him
a
book
cut
as
far
as
the
middle
an
epistolary
novel
by
mme
souza
he
started
reading
about
the
sufferings
and
virtuous
struggle
of
some
am233lie
de
mansfield
and
why
did
she
struggle
against
her
seducer
he
wondered
if
she
loved
him
god
could
not
have
put
into
her
soul
a
yearning
that
was
contrary
to
his
will
my
former
wife
didnt
struggle
and
maybe
she
was
right
nothing
has
been
discovered
pierre
again
said
to
himself
nothing
has
been
invented
we
can
know
only
that
we
know
nothing
and
that
is
the
highest
degree
of
human
wisdom
everything
within
him
and
around
him
seemed
confused
senseless
and
loathsome
but
in
this
very
loathing
for
everything
around
him
pierre
took
a
sort
of
irritating
pleasure
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
your
excellency
to
move
over
a
little
for
this
gentleman
asked
the
postmaster
coming
into
the
room
and
bringing
in
another
traveler
who
was
detained
for
lack
of
horses
this
was
a
squat
largeboned
sallow
wrinkled
old
man
with
gray
beetling
brows
over
glittering
eyes
of
an
indefinite
grayish
color
pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
table
got
up
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
prepared
for
him
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
the
man
who
had
come
in
and
not
looking
at
pierre
with
a
sullenly
weary
air
was
undressing
with
difficulty
helped
by
a
servant
left
in
a
fleecelined
nankeen
coat
with
felt
boots
on
his
skinny
bony
legs
the
traveler
sat
down
on
the
sofa
leaned
his
closecropped
head
very
big
and
broad
at
the
temples
against
the
back
and
looked
at
bezukhov
the
stern
intelligent
and
penetrating
expression
of
this
look
struck
pierre
he
wanted
to
start
a
conversation
with
this
traveler
but
as
he
was
preparing
to
address
him
with
a
question
about
the
road
the
traveler
closed
his
eyes
and
folding
his
wrinkled
old
mans
hands
on
the
finger
of
one
of
which
was
a
big
castiron
signet
ring
with
a
deaths
head
sat
motionless
either
resting
or
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
reflecting
deeply
and
calmly
on
something
the
travelers
servant
was
also
a
sallow
old
man
all
covered
with
wrinkles
with
no
beard
or
mustache
which
evidently
had
not
been
shaved
but
had
never
grown
the
agile
old
servant
opened
the
cellaret
prepared
the
tea
table
and
brought
a
boiling
samovar
when
everything
was
ready
the
traveler
opened
his
eyes
moved
to
the
table
and
having
poured
himself
a
glass
poured
another
for
the
beardless
old
man
and
handed
it
to
him
pierre
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasiness
and
the
necessity
even
the
unavoidability
of
getting
into
conversation
with
this
traveler
the
servant
brought
back
his
empty
overturned
glass
and
a
bitten
lump
of
sugar
and
asked
whether
anything
was
needed
nothing
give
me
the
book
said
the
traveler
the
servant
gave
him
a
book
which
looked
like
a
spiritual
one
to
pierre
and
the
traveler
immersed
himself
in
reading
pierre
was
looking
at
him
suddenly
the
traveler
set
the
book
aside
having
put
in
a
bookmark
and
closed
it
and
closing
his
eyes
and
leaning
back
sat
again
in
his
former
position
pierre
was
looking
at
him
and
had
no
time
to
turn
away
before
the
old
man
opened
his
eyes
and
fixed
his
firm
and
stern
gaze
directly
on
pierres
face
pierre
felt
embarrassed
and
wanted
to
avoid
that
gaze
but
the
old
mans
glittering
eyes
drew
him
irresistibly
to
them
ii
i
have
the
pleasure
of
speaking
with
count
bezukhov
if
im
not
mistaken
the
traveler
said
unhurriedly
and
loudly
pierre
looked
silently
and
questioningly
at
his
interlocutor
through
his
spectacles
ive
heard
about
you
the
traveler
went
on
and
about
the
misfortune
that
has
befallen
you
my
dear
sir
he
underlined
as
it
were
the
word
misfortune
as
if
to
say
yes
misfortune
whatever
you
may
call
it
i
know
that
what
happened
to
you
in
moscow
was
a
misfortune
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
my
dear
sir
pierre
blushed
and
hastily
lowering
his
legs
from
the
bed
leaned
towards
the
old
man
smiling
unnaturally
and
timidly
i
have
mentioned
it
my
dear
sir
not
out
of
curiosity
but
for
more
important
reasons
he
paused
not
letting
pierre
out
of
his
gaze
and
shifted
on
the
sofa
inviting
pierre
by
this
gesture
to
sit
next
to
him
pierre
found
it
unpleasant
to
get
into
conversation
with
this
old
man
but
involuntarily
submitting
to
him
he
went
over
and
sat
down
next
to
him
you
are
unhappy
my
dear
sir
he
went
on
you
are
young
i
am
old
i
should
like
to
help
you
as
much
as
i
can
ah
yes
said
pierre
with
an
unnatural
smile
im
very
gratefulwhere
are
you
coming
from
the
travelers
face
was
not
gentle
but
even
cold
and
stern
yet
in
spite
of
that
his
new
acquaintances
words
and
face
had
an
irresistibly
attractive
effect
on
pierre
but
if
for
some
reason
you
find
conversation
with
me
unpleasant
said
the
old
man
say
so
my
dear
sir
and
he
suddenly
smiled
an
unexpectedly
gentle
fatherly
smile
ah
no
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
im
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
pierre
and
glancing
once
again
at
his
new
acquaintances
hands
he
took
a
closer
look
at
his
ring
he
saw
a
deaths
head
on
it
a
masonic
sign
allow
me
to
ask
he
said
are
you
a
mason
yes
i
belong
to
the
brotherhood
of
freemasons
said
the
traveler
peering
more
and
more
deeply
into
pierres
eyes
and
i
give
you
a
brotherly
handshake
on
my
own
behalf
and
on
theirs
im
afraid
said
pierre
smiling
and
hesitating
between
the
trust
which
the
mason
personally
inspired
in
him
and
his
habit
of
mocking
masonic
beliefs
im
afraid
im
very
far
from
understandinghow
shall
i
put
itim
afraid
my
way
of
thinking
about
the
universe
is
so
much
the
opposite
of
yours
that
we
wont
understand
each
other
your
way
of
thinking
is
known
to
me
said
the
mason
and
this
way
of
thinking
of
yours
which
you
are
talking
about
and
which
seems
to
you
the
result
of
your
own
mental
work
is
the
way
of
thinking
of
the
majority
of
people
the
monotonous
fruit
of
pride
laziness
and
ignorance
forgive
me
my
dear
sir
but
if
i
did
not
know
it
i
would
not
be
talking
with
you
your
way
of
thinking
is
a
lamentable
error
just
as
i
may
suppose
you
to
have
fallen
into
error
pierre
said
with
a
weak
smile
i
shall
never
dare
to
say
that
i
know
the
truth
said
the
mason
amazing
pierre
more
and
more
with
his
definite
and
firm
speech
no
one
can
attain
to
the
truth
by
himself
only
stone
by
stone
with
the
participation
of
all
over
millions
of
generations
from
our
forefather
adam
down
to
our
time
is
the
temple
being
built
which
is
to
become
a
worthy
dwelling
place
for
the
great
god
said
the
mason
and
he
closed
his
eyes
i
must
tell
you
that
i
dont
believe
dontbelieve
in
god
pierre
said
with
regret
and
effort
feeling
the
need
to
speak
the
whole
truth
the
mason
looked
at
pierre
attentively
and
smiled
as
a
rich
man
holding
millions
in
his
hands
would
smile
at
a
poor
man
who
has
said
to
him
that
he
the
poor
man
did
not
have
the
five
roubles
that
would
make
his
happiness
but
you
dont
know
him
my
dear
sir
said
the
mason
you
cannot
know
him
you
dont
know
him
and
that
is
why
you
are
unhappy
yes
yes
i
am
unhappy
pierre
agreed
but
what
am
i
to
do
you
dont
know
him
my
dear
sir
and
that
is
why
you
are
very
unhappy
you
dont
know
him
but
he
is
here
he
is
in
me
he
is
in
my
words
he
is
in
you
and
even
in
that
blasphemous
talk
you
have
just
produced
the
mason
said
in
a
stern
trembling
voice
he
paused
and
sighed
obviously
trying
to
calm
himself
if
he
did
not
exist
he
said
softly
we
would
not
be
talking
about
him
my
dear
sir
what
whom
are
we
talking
about
whom
have
you
denied
he
said
suddenly
with
rapturous
sternness
and
power
in
his
voice
who
invented
him
if
he
does
not
exist
why
has
the
supposition
appeared
in
you
that
there
is
such
an
incomprehensible
being
why
do
you
and
the
whole
world
suppose
the
existence
of
such
an
unfathomable
being
a
being
almighty
eternal
and
infinite
in
all
his
qualities
he
stopped
and
was
silent
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
and
did
not
want
to
break
that
silence
he
exists
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
him
the
mason
spoke
again
not
looking
at
pierres
face
but
straight
ahead
leafing
through
his
book
with
his
old
mans
hands
which
could
not
remain
still
because
of
his
inner
turmoil
if
you
doubted
the
existence
of
some
man
i
would
bring
this
man
to
you
i
would
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
to
you
but
how
can
i
an
insignificant
mortal
show
all
his
almightiness
all
his
eternity
all
his
goodness
to
one
who
is
blind
or
who
closes
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
not
to
understand
his
own
loathsomeness
and
depravity
he
paused
who
are
you
what
are
you
you
fancy
that
youre
wise
because
you
were
able
to
utter
those
blasphemous
words
he
said
with
a
gloomy
and
scornful
smile
but
you
are
more
foolish
and
mad
than
a
little
child
who
playing
with
a
skillfully
made
clock
would
dare
say
that
since
he
does
not
understand
the
purpose
of
this
clock
he
does
not
believe
in
the
master
who
made
it
it
is
hard
to
know
him
for
centuries
starting
with
our
forefather
adam
and
down
to
our
days
we
have
been
working
towards
that
knowledge
and
are
infinitely
far
from
reaching
our
goal
but
we
see
our
incomprehension
only
as
our
weakness
and
his
grandeur
with
a
swelling
heart
with
glittering
eyes
pierre
gazed
into
the
masons
face
listened
to
him
did
not
interrupt
him
did
not
ask
anything
and
believed
with
his
whole
soul
what
this
stranger
was
telling
him
whether
he
believed
those
reasonable
arguments
in
the
masons
speech
or
believed
as
children
do
the
intonations
convictions
and
heartfelt
emotion
in
the
masons
speech
the
trembling
of
his
voice
which
sometimes
almost
interrupted
him
or
those
glittering
old
mans
eyes
grown
old
in
that
conviction
or
the
calmness
firmness
and
knowledge
of
purpose
which
shone
in
the
masons
whole
being
and
which
struck
him
especially
strongly
compared
with
his
own
slackness
and
hopelessness
in
any
case
he
wanted
to
believe
with
his
whole
soul
and
did
believe
and
experienced
a
joyful
feeling
of
peace
renewal
and
return
to
life
he
is
not
apprehended
by
reason
but
by
life
said
the
mason
i
dont
understand
said
pierre
fearfully
sensing
doubt
arising
in
him
he
feared
the
vagueness
and
weakness
of
his
interlocutors
arguments
he
feared
not
believing
him
i
dont
understand
he
said
how
is
it
that
human
reason
cannot
apprehend
the
knowledge
you
speak
of
the
mason
smiled
his
meek
fatherly
smile
the
highest
wisdom
and
truth
is
like
the
most
pure
liquid
which
we
want
to
receive
into
ourselves
he
said
can
i
receive
this
pure
liquid
in
an
impure
vessel
and
then
judge
its
purity
only
by
purifying
myself
inwardly
can
i
keep
the
liquid
i
receive
pure
to
some
degree
yes
yes
thats
so
pierre
said
joyfully
the
supreme
wisdom
is
based
not
on
reason
alone
not
on
the
secular
sciences
of
physics
history
chemistry
and
so
on
into
which
rational
knowledge
is
divided
the
higher
knowledge
has
one
sciencethe
science
of
the
all
the
science
that
explains
the
whole
universe
and
the
place
man
occupies
in
it
to
contain
this
science
it
is
necessary
to
purify
and
renew
ones
inner
man
and
thus
before
one
can
know
one
must
believe
and
perfect
oneself
and
to
achieve
that
a
divine
light
called
conscience
has
been
put
in
our
soul
yes
yes
pierre
agreed
look
at
your
inner
man
with
spiritual
eyes
and
ask
if
you
are
pleased
with
yourself
what
have
you
achieved
being
guided
by
reason
alone
what
are
you
you
are
young
you
are
rich
you
are
educated
my
dear
sir
what
have
you
done
with
all
these
good
things
that
have
been
given
you
are
you
content
with
yourself
and
your
life
no
i
hate
my
life
pierre
said
wincing
if
you
hate
it
change
it
purify
yourself
and
insofar
as
you
purify
yourself
you
will
learn
wisdom
look
at
your
life
my
dear
sir
how
have
you
been
spending
it
in
riotous
orgies
and
depravity
taking
everything
from
society
and
giving
it
nothing
you
received
wealth
how
have
you
used
it
what
have
you
done
for
your
neighbor
have
you
thought
about
the
tens
of
thousands
of
your
slaves
have
you
helped
them
physically
and
morally
no
you
have
used
their
labor
in
order
to
lead
a
debauched
life
that
is
what
you
have
done
have
you
chosen
some
position
in
which
you
could
be
useful
to
your
neighbor
no
you
have
been
spending
your
life
in
idleness
then
my
dear
sir
you
married
taking
upon
yourself
the
responsibility
for
guiding
a
young
woman
and
what
did
you
do
you
did
not
help
her
my
dear
sir
to
find
the
path
of
truth
you
hurled
her
into
an
abyss
of
deceit
and
misfortune
a
man
insulted
you
and
you
shot
him
and
you
say
that
you
do
not
know
god
and
hate
your
life
that
is
no
wonder
my
dear
sir
after
these
words
the
mason
as
if
tired
after
talking
for
so
long
again
leaned
back
on
the
sofa
and
closed
his
eyes
pierre
looked
at
this
stern
motionless
almost
dead
old
face
and
moved
his
lips
soundlessly
he
wanted
to
say
yes
a
loathsome
idle
depraved
life
but
he
dared
not
break
the
silence
the
mason
cleared
his
throat
hoarsely
as
old
people
do
and
called
for
his
servant
what
about
the
horses
he
asked
not
looking
at
pierre
the
relay
has
been
brought
the
servant
answered
wont
you
get
some
rest
no
tell
them
to
harness
up
can
it
be
hell
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
without
finishing
what
he
was
saying
and
without
promising
to
help
me
thought
pierre
getting
up
and
beginning
to
pace
the
room
with
his
head
lowered
glancing
occasionally
at
the
mason
yes
i
didnt
think
about
it
but
ive
led
a
contemptible
depraved
life
and
i
didnt
like
it
or
want
it
thought
pierre
but
this
man
knows
the
truth
and
if
he
wanted
he
could
reveal
it
to
me
pierre
wanted
to
say
that
to
the
mason
but
did
not
dare
the
traveler
having
packed
his
things
was
buttoning
up
his
coat
with
his
old
accustomed
hands
when
he
finished
he
turned
to
bezukhov
and
said
to
him
indifferently
in
a
polite
tone
where
are
you
going
now
my
dear
sir
if
i
may
ask
meto
petersburg
pierre
replied
in
a
childish
irresolute
voice
thank
you
i
agree
with
you
in
everything
but
dont
think
that
im
so
bad
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
to
be
what
you
want
me
to
be
but
ive
never
found
help
from
anybodyhowever
i
am
to
blame
for
it
all
in
the
first
place
help
me
teach
me
and
maybe
ill
pierre
could
not
go
on
he
snuffed
his
nose
and
turned
away
the
mason
was
silent
for
a
long
time
evidently
thinking
something
over
help
is
given
only
by
god
he
said
but
that
measure
of
help
which
our
order
has
in
its
power
to
give
you
it
will
give
you
my
dear
sir
you
are
going
to
petersburg
give
this
to
count
willarski
he
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four
allow
me
to
give
you
one
piece
of
advice
when
you
arrive
in
the
capital
devote
the
initial
time
to
solitude
to
examining
yourself
and
do
not
set
out
on
the
former
ways
of
life
with
that
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
my
dear
sir
he
said
noticing
that
his
servant
had
come
into
the
room
and
success
the
traveler
was
osip
alexeevich
bazdeev
as
pierre
learned
from
the
postmasters
register
bazdeev
had
been
one
of
the
bestknown
masons
and
martinists
even
back
in
novikovs
time
long
after
his
departure
pierre
neither
going
to
bed
nor
asking
for
horses
paced
the
stationhouse
room
thinking
over
his
depraved
past
and
with
a
rapture
of
renewal
picturing
to
himself
his
blissful
irreproachable
and
virtuous
future
which
seemed
so
easy
to
him
he
had
been
depraved
it
seemed
to
him
only
because
he
had
somehow
accidentally
forgotten
how
good
it
was
to
be
virtuous
in
his
soul
there
remained
no
trace
of
his
former
doubts
he
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
brotherhood
of
people
united
with
the
purpose
of
supporting
each
other
on
the
path
of
virtue
and
that
was
what
he
imagined
masonry
to
be
iii
on
arriving
in
petersburg
pierre
did
not
inform
anyone
of
his
arrival
did
not
go
out
anywhere
and
started
spending
whole
days
reading
thomas
224
kempis
a
book
which
some
unknown
person
had
delivered
to
him
pierre
understood
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
while
reading
this
book
he
understood
the
delight
previously
unknown
to
him
of
the
possibility
of
achieving
perfection
and
the
possibility
of
brotherly
and
active
love
among
people
which
osip
alexeevich
had
revealed
to
him
a
week
after
his
arrival
the
young
polish
count
willarski
whom
pierre
knew
superficially
in
petersburg
society
came
into
his
room
in
the
evening
with
that
official
and
solemn
look
with
which
dolokhovs
second
had
come
to
him
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
making
sure
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
except
pierre
addressed
him
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
suggestion
and
a
message
count
he
said
without
sitting
down
a
person
very
highly
placed
in
our
brotherhood
has
solicited
for
you
to
be
received
into
the
brotherhood
before
the
fixed
term
and
has
suggested
that
i
be
your
sponsor
i
consider
it
my
sacred
duty
to
fulfill
the
will
of
this
person
do
you
wish
under
my
sponsorship
to
enter
the
brotherhood
of
freemasons
the
cold
and
severe
tone
of
this
man
whom
he
had
almost
always
seen
at
balls
with
an
amiable
smile
in
the
society
of
the
most
brilliant
women
struck
pierre
yes
i
do
he
said
willarski
inclined
his
head
one
more
question
count
he
said
which
i
ask
you
to
answer
not
as
a
future
mason
but
as
an
honest
man
galant
homme
in
all
sincerity
have
you
renounced
your
former
convictions
do
you
believe
in
god
pierre
reflected
yesyes
i
believe
in
god
he
said
in
that
case
willarski
began
but
pierre
interrupted
him
yes
i
believe
in
god
he
said
once
more
in
that
case
we
can
go
said
willarski
my
carriage
is
at
your
service
willarski
was
silent
the
whole
way
to
pierres
question
of
what
he
must
do
and
how
to
answer
willarski
said
only
that
brothers
more
worthy
than
he
would
test
him
and
that
pierre
need
do
nothing
more
than
tell
the
truth
having
driven
through
the
gates
of
a
big
house
where
the
lodge
was
quartered
and
gone
up
a
dark
stairway
they
went
into
a
small
welllit
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
fur
coats
without
the
help
of
servants
from
the
anteroom
they
went
into
another
room
some
man
in
strange
attire
appeared
at
the
door
willarski
going
to
meet
him
said
something
to
him
quietly
in
french
and
went
over
to
a
small
wardrobe
in
which
pierre
noticed
kinds
of
attire
he
had
never
seen
before
taking
a
cloth
from
the
wardrobe
willarski
put
it
over
pierres
eyes
and
knotted
it
behind
catching
pierres
hair
painfully
then
he
drew
him
to
himself
kissed
him
and
taking
his
hand
led
him
somewhere
the
hair
caught
in
the
knot
caused
him
pain
he
winced
and
smiled
from
pain
and
shame
at
something
his
enormous
figure
with
lowered
arms
and
wincing
smiling
physiognomy
moved
after
willarski
with
uncertain
timid
steps
having
led
him
by
the
hand
for
some
ten
paces
willarski
stopped
whatever
happens
to
you
he
said
you
must
courageously
endure
everything
if
you
are
firmly
resolved
to
enter
our
brotherhood
pierre
responded
affirmatively
by
inclining
his
head
when
you
hear
knocking
on
the
door
you
will
unbind
your
eyes
added
willarski
i
wish
you
courage
and
success
and
pressing
pierres
hand
willarski
went
out
left
alone
pierre
went
on
smiling
in
the
same
way
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
couple
of
times
put
his
hand
to
the
cloth
as
if
wishing
to
take
it
off
and
lowered
it
again
the
five
minutes
he
spent
blindfolded
seemed
like
an
hour
to
him
his
hands
became
swollen
his
legs
gave
way
under
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
tired
he
experienced
the
most
complex
and
varied
feelings
he
was
afraid
of
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
and
still
more
afraid
that
he
would
show
his
fear
he
was
curious
to
know
what
he
was
about
to
go
through
what
would
be
revealed
to
him
but
most
of
all
he
felt
joy
that
the
moment
had
come
when
he
would
finally
enter
the
path
of
renewal
and
an
actively
virtuous
life
which
he
had
been
dreaming
of
since
his
meeting
with
osip
alexeevich
there
was
loud
knocking
at
the
door
pierre
took
off
the
blindfold
and
looked
around
the
room
was
pitchdark
only
in
one
place
a
lamp
was
burning
inside
something
white
pierre
went
closer
and
saw
that
the
lamp
was
standing
on
a
black
table
on
which
lay
an
open
book
the
book
was
the
gospel
the
white
thing
in
which
the
lamp
was
burning
was
a
human
skull
with
its
holes
and
teeth
having
read
the
first
words
of
the
gospel
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
pierre
went
around
the
table
and
saw
a
large
open
box
filled
with
something
this
was
a
coffin
with
bones
he
was
not
surprised
in
the
least
by
what
he
saw
hoping
to
enter
a
totally
new
life
totally
different
from
his
former
one
he
expected
everything
to
be
extraordinary
still
more
extraordinry
than
what
he
saw
a
skull
a
coffin
the
gospelit
seemed
he
had
expected
it
all
had
expected
still
more
trying
to
call
up
a
tender
feeling
in
himself
he
looked
around
god
death
love
the
brotherhood
of
men
he
said
to
himself
connecting
vague
but
joyful
notions
of
something
with
these
words
the
door
opened
and
someone
came
in
by
the
faint
light
to
which
pierres
eyes
however
had
become
accustomed
a
short
man
came
in
evidently
having
come
from
light
into
darkness
the
man
stopped
then
he
moved
with
cautious
steps
towards
the
table
and
placed
on
it
his
small
hands
covered
with
leather
gloves
this
short
man
was
wearing
a
white
leather
apron
that
covered
his
chest
and
his
legs
on
his
neck
there
was
some
sort
of
necklace
and
behind
the
necklace
rose
a
high
white
jabot
framing
his
elongated
face
which
was
lit
from
below
why
have
you
come
here
asked
the
man
turning
in
the
direction
of
pierre
who
had
made
a
slight
rustle
why
have
you
who
do
not
believe
in
the
truths
of
the
light
and
do
not
see
the
light
why
have
you
come
here
what
do
you
want
from
us
wisdom
virtue
enlightenment
at
the
moment
when
the
door
opened
and
the
unknown
man
came
in
pierre
experienced
a
feeling
of
fear
and
awe
similar
to
what
he
had
experienced
in
childhood
at
confession
he
felt
himself
alone
with
a
man
who
was
a
total
stranger
in
the
circumstances
of
life
yet
close
in
the
brotherhood
of
men
with
a
pounding
heart
that
took
his
breath
away
pierre
moved
towards
the
rhetor
so
the
masons
call
a
brother
who
prepares
a
seeker
to
enter
the
brotherhood
coming
closer
pierre
recognized
the
rhetor
as
an
acquaintance
smolyaninov
but
it
offended
him
to
think
that
he
was
an
acquaintance
the
man
who
had
come
in
was
only
a
brother
and
a
virtuous
preceptor
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
utter
a
word
so
that
the
rhetor
had
to
repeat
his
question
yes
iiwant
renewal
pierre
uttered
with
difficulty
very
well
said
smolyaninov
and
he
went
on
at
once
do
you
have
any
idea
of
the
means
by
which
our
holy
order
can
help
you
to
achieve
your
goal
the
rhetor
asked
calmly
and
quickly
ihopefor
guidancehelpin
my
renewal
pierre
said
in
a
trembling
voice
and
speaking
with
difficulty
owing
to
his
excitement
and
to
being
unused
to
speaking
about
abstract
subjects
in
russian
what
is
your
notion
of
freemasonry
i
presume
that
freemasonry
is
the
fraternit233
and
equality
of
men
with
virtuous
goals
said
pierre
embarrassed
even
as
he
was
speaking
by
the
unsuitability
of
his
words
to
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
i
presume
very
well
the
rhetor
said
hastily
evidently
fully
satisfied
with
this
reply
have
you
sought
the
means
of
achieving
your
goal
in
religion
no
i
considered
it
incorrect
and
did
not
follow
it
pierre
said
so
softly
that
the
rhetor
did
not
hear
and
asked
him
what
he
had
said
i
was
an
atheist
pierre
replied
you
seek
the
truth
in
order
to
follow
its
laws
in
life
consequently
you
seek
wisdom
and
virtue
is
that
it
the
rhetor
said
after
a
moments
silence
yes
yes
pierre
agreed
the
rhetor
cleared
his
throat
folded
his
gloved
hands
on
his
chest
and
began
to
speak
now
i
must
reveal
to
you
the
main
goal
of
our
order
he
said
and
if
this
goal
coincides
with
yours
it
will
be
useful
for
you
to
enter
our
brotherhood
the
first
main
goal
and
withal
the
foundation
of
our
order
on
which
it
is
established
and
which
no
human
power
can
cast
down
is
the
preservation
and
handing
on
to
posterity
of
a
certain
important
mysterywhich
has
come
down
to
us
from
ancient
times
and
even
from
the
first
man
on
which
mystery
perhaps
the
fate
of
the
human
race
depends
but
as
it
is
the
nature
of
this
mystery
that
no
one
can
know
it
and
use
it
unless
he
has
been
prepared
by
long
and
diligent
selfpurification
not
everyone
can
hope
soon
to
attain
it
therefore
we
have
a
second
goal
which
consists
in
preparing
our
members
as
much
as
possible
setting
their
hearts
to
rights
purifying
and
enlightening
their
reason
by
means
revealed
to
us
by
tradition
from
men
who
labored
in
search
of
this
mystery
and
thereby
making
them
capable
of
apprehending
it
in
purifying
and
setting
to
rights
our
members
we
try
thirdly
to
set
to
rights
the
whole
human
race
offering
it
through
our
members
an
example
of
piety
and
virtue
and
thereby
trying
with
all
our
might
to
oppose
the
evil
that
reigns
in
the
world
think
it
over
and
i
will
come
to
you
again
he
said
and
left
the
room
to
oppose
the
evil
that
reigns
in
the
world
pierre
repeated
and
he
pictured
his
future
activity
on
this
path
he
pictured
people
such
as
he
himself
had
been
two
weeks
ago
and
he
mentally
addressed
to
them
a
didactic
and
admonitory
speech
he
pictured
depraved
and
unfortunate
people
whom
he
helped
in
word
and
deed
he
pictured
oppressors
whose
victims
he
saved
of
the
three
goals
mentioned
by
the
rhetor
this
last
onesetting
mankind
to
rightswas
especially
close
to
pierre
the
certain
important
mystery
which
the
rhetor
had
mentioned
though
it
aroused
his
curiosity
did
not
seem
essential
to
him
and
the
second
goal
purifying
and
setting
himself
to
rights
interested
him
little
because
at
that
moment
he
enjoyed
feeling
himself
already
fully
set
to
rights
from
his
former
vices
and
ready
only
for
the
good
half
an
hour
later
the
rhetor
came
back
to
transmit
to
the
seeker
the
seven
virtues
corresponding
to
the
seven
steps
of
solomons
temple
which
every
mason
was
supposed
to
cultivate
in
himself
these
virtues
were
1
discretion
keeping
the
secrets
of
the
order
2
obedience
to
the
higher
ranks
of
the
order
3
good
morals
4
love
of
mankind
5
courage
6
generosity
and
7
love
of
death
seventh
said
the
rhetor
try
by
frequent
thoughts
of
death
to
bring
yourself
to
the
point
where
it
no
longer
seems
a
fearsome
enemy
to
you
but
a
friendwho
delivers
the
soul
grown
weary
in
the
labors
of
virtue
from
this
calamitous
life
and
leads
it
to
the
place
of
recompense
and
peace
yes
that
should
be
so
thought
pierre
when
after
these
words
the
rhetor
went
away
again
leaving
him
to
his
solitary
reflections
that
should
be
so
but
im
still
so
weak
that
i
love
my
life
the
meaning
of
which
is
only
now
being
gradually
revealed
to
me
but
he
did
feel
in
his
soul
the
other
five
virtues
that
he
remembered
counting
them
on
his
fingers
courage
and
generosity
and
good
morals
and
love
of
mankind
and
especially
obedience
which
even
seemed
to
him
not
a
virtue
but
happiness
itself
it
was
so
joyful
for
him
now
to
be
delivered
of
his
arbitrariness
and
submit
his
will
to
a
person
or
persons
who
knew
the
unquestionable
truth
pierre
forgot
the
seventh
virtue
and
simply
could
not
recall
what
it
was
the
third
time
the
rhetor
came
back
sooner
and
asked
pierre
whether
he
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
and
was
determined
to
submit
himself
to
everything
that
was
demanded
of
him
im
ready
for
everything
said
pierre
i
must
also
inform
you
said
the
rhetor
that
our
order
conveys
its
teaching
not
only
by
words
but
by
other
means
which
affect
the
true
seeker
of
wisdom
and
virtue
perhaps
even
more
strongly
than
verbal
explanations
this
temple
with
its
decorations
which
you
see
must
already
have
explained
to
your
heart
if
it
is
sincere
more
than
words
can
do
you
will
see
perhaps
during
your
further
initiation
a
similar
means
of
explanation
our
order
imitates
ancient
societies
which
revealed
their
teaching
through
hieroglyphics
a
hieroglyph
said
the
rhetor
is
the
designation
of
something
not
subject
to
the
senses
which
contains
in
itself
qualities
similar
to
what
it
is
imaging
pierre
knew
very
well
what
a
hieroglyph
was
but
did
not
dare
speak
he
listened
silently
to
the
rhetor
feeling
from
it
all
that
the
testing
was
about
to
begin
if
you
are
firm
then
i
must
commence
your
induction
said
the
rhetor
coming
closer
to
pierre
as
a
sign
of
generosity
i
ask
you
to
give
me
all
your
valuables
but
i
have
nothing
with
me
said
pierre
thinking
that
he
was
being
asked
to
hand
over
everything
he
owned
that
is
what
you
have
with
you
a
watch
money
rings
pierre
hurriedly
took
out
his
purse
his
watch
but
for
a
long
time
could
not
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
finger
when
that
was
done
the
mason
said
as
a
sign
of
obedience
i
ask
you
to
undress
pierre
took
off
his
tailcoat
his
waistcoat
and
his
left
boot
as
the
rhetor
directed
the
mason
opened
his
shirt
on
his
left
breast
and
bending
down
pulled
up
his
left
trouser
leg
above
the
knee
pierre
wanted
hurriedly
to
take
off
his
right
boot
and
pull
up
his
trouser
to
spare
the
stranger
the
effort
but
the
mason
said
there
was
no
need
for
that
and
handed
him
a
slipper
for
his
left
foot
with
a
childish
smile
of
embarrassment
doubt
and
selfmockery
which
came
to
his
face
against
his
will
pierre
stood
with
lowered
arms
and
straddled
legs
before
his
brother
rhetor
waiting
for
new
orders
from
him
and
finally
as
a
sign
of
openheartedness
i
ask
you
to
reveal
to
me
your
main
predilection
he
said
my
predilection
i
had
so
many
said
pierre
the
predilection
which
more
than
all
others
made
you
vacillate
on
the
path
of
virtue
said
the
mason
pierre
paused
searching
wine
gluttony
idleness
laziness
hot
temper
anger
women
he
went
through
his
vices
weighing
them
mentally
and
did
not
know
which
to
give
preference
to
women
pierre
said
in
a
low
barely
audible
voice
the
mason
did
not
stir
and
did
not
speak
for
a
long
time
after
this
reply
at
last
he
moved
towards
pierre
took
the
cloth
that
was
lying
on
the
table
and
again
blindfolded
him
i
tell
you
for
the
last
time
turn
all
your
attention
to
yourself
lay
chains
upon
your
feelings
and
seek
blessedness
not
in
passions
but
in
your
own
heartthe
source
of
blessedness
is
not
outside
but
inside
us
pierre
already
felt
in
himself
that
refreshing
source
of
blessedness
which
now
filled
his
soul
with
joy
and
tender
feeling
iv
soon
after
that
it
was
not
the
rhetor
who
came
into
the
dark
temple
for
pierre
but
his
sponsor
willarski
whom
he
recognized
by
his
voice
to
renewed
questions
about
the
firmness
of
his
intentions
pierre
replied
yes
yes
i
agree
and
with
a
radiant
childish
smile
with
his
fat
chest
bared
walking
unevenly
and
timidly
with
one
shod
foot
and
the
other
unshod
he
went
ahead
with
willarski
holding
a
sword
to
his
bared
chest
from
the
room
he
was
led
down
corridors
turning
back
and
forth
and
was
finally
led
to
the
doors
of
the
lodge
willarski
coughed
the
response
was
a
masonic
rapping
of
hammers
and
the
door
opened
before
him
someones
bass
voice
pierre
was
still
blindfolded
asked
him
questions
about
who
he
was
where
and
when
he
was
born
and
so
on
then
he
was
again
led
somewhere
with
his
eyes
still
covered
and
as
he
walked
they
told
him
allegories
about
the
labors
of
his
journey
about
sacred
friendship
about
the
preeternal
architect
of
the
world
about
the
courage
with
which
he
must
endure
toils
and
dangers
during
the
journey
pierre
noticed
that
they
referred
to
him
now
as
the
seeker
now
as
the
sufferer
now
as
the
postulant
and
made
various
noises
with
hammers
and
swords
just
as
he
was
brought
to
some
sort
of
object
he
noticed
that
there
was
perplexity
and
confusion
among
his
guides
he
heard
the
men
around
him
arguing
among
themselves
in
whispers
and
one
of
them
insisting
that
he
had
to
be
led
across
some
sort
of
rug
after
that
they
took
his
right
hand
put
it
on
something
and
told
him
to
hold
a
compass
to
his
left
breast
with
his
left
hand
and
made
him
recite
the
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
laws
of
the
order
repeating
words
that
someone
else
read
then
they
put
out
the
candles
lit
a
spirit
lamp
as
pierre
knew
by
the
smell
and
told
him
he
would
see
the
lesser
light
the
blindfold
was
removed
from
his
eyes
and
pierre
saw
as
in
a
dream
by
the
faint
light
of
the
spirit
lamp
several
men
who
stood
facing
him
in
the
same
aprons
as
the
rhetor
and
holding
swords
pointed
at
his
breast
among
them
stood
a
man
in
a
bloody
white
shirt
seeing
that
pierre
moved
his
chest
towards
the
swords
wishing
them
to
pierce
him
but
the
swords
withdrew
and
his
eyes
were
covered
again
now
you
have
seen
the
lesser
light
someones
voice
said
to
him
then
candles
were
lit
again
the
voices
said
he
must
see
the
full
light
and
his
eyes
were
uncovered
again
and
more
than
ten
voices
suddenly
said
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
pierre
gradually
began
to
come
to
himself
and
look
around
at
the
room
he
was
in
and
the
men
who
were
in
it
some
twelve
men
were
sitting
around
a
long
table
covered
in
black
all
in
the
same
attire
as
he
had
already
seen
pierre
knew
some
of
them
from
petersburg
society
in
the
chairmans
place
sat
an
unknown
young
man
with
a
special
cross
on
his
neck
to
his
right
sat
the
italian
abb233
pierre
had
seen
two
years
before
at
anna
pavlovnas
there
was
a
rather
important
dignitary
and
a
swiss
tutor
who
formerly
lived
with
the
kuragins
they
were
all
solemnly
silent
listening
to
the
words
of
the
chairman
who
was
holding
a
hammer
in
his
hand
the
wall
had
a
burning
star
embedded
in
it
on
one
side
of
the
table
was
a
small
rug
with
various
images
on
the
other
something
like
an
altar
with
a
gospel
book
and
a
skull
around
the
table
stood
seven
large
candle
stands
as
in
a
church
two
of
the
brothers
led
pierre
to
the
altar
placed
his
feet
at
right
angles
and
ordered
him
to
lie
down
saying
that
he
now
prostrates
himself
at
the
gates
of
the
temple
he
should
receive
the
trowel
first
one
of
the
brothers
said
in
a
whisper
ah
enough
i
beg
you
said
another
pierre
looked
around
perplexedly
with
his
nearsighted
eyes
not
obeying
and
doubt
suddenly
came
over
him
where
am
i
what
am
i
doing
arent
they
laughing
at
me
wont
i
be
ashamed
to
remember
it
but
this
doubt
lasted
only
a
moment
pierre
looked
at
the
serious
faces
of
the
people
around
him
remembered
all
he
had
already
gone
through
and
realized
that
he
could
not
stop
halfway
he
was
horrified
at
his
doubt
and
trying
to
recall
his
former
tender
feeling
he
prostrated
at
the
gates
of
the
temple
and
indeed
a
tender
feeling
still
stronger
than
before
came
over
him
after
he
had
lain
there
for
some
time
they
told
him
to
get
up
and
put
on
a
white
leather
apron
such
as
the
others
were
wearing
handed
him
a
trowel
and
three
pairs
of
gloves
and
then
the
grand
master
addressed
him
he
told
him
to
try
not
to
stain
in
any
way
the
whiteness
of
this
apron
which
represented
strength
and
blamelessness
then
of
the
unexplained
trowel
he
told
him
to
work
with
it
to
purify
his
heart
of
vice
and
tolerantly
smooth
over
the
heart
of
his
neighbor
then
of
the
first
pair
of
mens
gloves
he
said
that
pierre
could
not
know
their
meaning
but
had
to
keep
them
of
the
second
pair
of
mens
gloves
he
said
that
he
was
to
wear
them
at
meetings
and
finally
of
the
third
pair
which
were
womens
gloves
he
said
my
gentle
brother
these
womens
gloves
are
destined
for
you
as
well
give
them
to
the
woman
whom
you
honor
most
of
all
by
this
gift
you
will
give
assurance
of
the
blamelessness
of
your
heart
to
the
one
whom
you
elect
as
your
worthy
lady
mason
after
a
pause
he
added
but
preserve
these
gloves
gentle
brother
that
they
not
adorn
unclean
hands
just
as
the
grand
master
pronounced
these
last
words
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
the
chairman
became
embarrassed
pierre
became
still
more
embarrassed
blushed
to
the
point
of
tears
as
children
do
started
looking
around
uneasily
and
an
awkward
silence
ensued
this
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
brothers
who
leading
pierre
to
the
rug
began
reading
to
him
from
a
notebook
the
explanation
of
all
the
images
depicted
on
it
the
sun
the
moon
a
hammer
a
plumb
line
a
trowel
a
rough
stone
and
a
squared
stone
a
pillar
three
windows
and
so
on
then
pierre
was
assigned
his
place
shown
the
signs
of
the
lodge
told
the
password
and
finally
allowed
to
sit
down
the
grand
master
began
to
read
the
rules
the
rules
were
very
long
and
pierre
from
joy
excitement
and
abashedness
was
unable
to
understand
what
was
being
read
to
him
he
heard
well
only
the
last
words
of
the
rules
which
stayed
in
his
memory
in
our
temples
we
know
no
other
distinctions
the
grand
master
read
than
those
between
virtue
and
vice
beware
of
making
any
distinction
that
may
violate
equality
fly
to
aid
your
brother
whoever
he
may
be
instruct
him
who
errs
raise
up
the
fallen
and
never
nurse
any
malice
or
enmity
against
your
brother
be
gentle
and
affable
arouse
the
fire
of
virtue
in
all
hearts
share
your
happiness
with
your
neighbor
and
let
envy
never
cloud
this
pure
delight
forgive
your
enemy
take
no
revenge
upon
him
unless
it
be
by
doing
him
good
having
thus
fulfilled
the
higher
law
you
will
recover
the
traces
of
the
ancient
majesty
you
have
lost
he
concluded
and
standing
up
he
embraced
pierre
and
kissed
him
pierre
looked
around
with
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes
not
knowing
how
to
reply
to
the
congratulations
and
renewals
of
acquaintance
that
surrounded
him
he
did
not
recognize
any
acquaintances
in
all
these
people
he
saw
only
brothers
and
he
burned
with
impatience
to
start
working
with
them
the
grand
master
rapped
with
his
hammer
everyone
sat
down
in
their
places
and
one
brother
read
a
sermon
about
the
necessity
of
humility
the
grand
master
suggested
that
they
fulfill
the
last
duty
and
the
important
dignitary
who
bore
the
title
of
alms
collector
started
making
the
round
of
the
brothers
pierre
wanted
to
write
down
all
the
money
he
had
on
the
list
of
alms
but
was
afraid
of
showing
pride
and
wrote
down
the
same
amount
as
the
others
did
the
meeting
was
over
and
on
his
return
home
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
he
had
come
back
from
some
distant
journey
where
he
had
spent
dozens
of
years
had
changed
completely
and
had
detached
himself
from
the
former
order
and
habits
of
his
life
v
the
day
after
his
reception
into
the
lodge
pierre
was
sitting
at
home
reading
a
book
and
trying
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
a
square
one
side
of
which
represented
god
another
the
moral
the
third
the
physical
and
the
fourth
their
mixture
from
time
to
time
he
tore
himself
away
from
the
book
and
the
square
and
in
his
imagination
put
together
a
new
plan
of
life
for
himself
the
day
before
he
had
been
told
in
the
lodge
that
the
rumor
of
his
duel
had
reached
the
sovereign
and
that
it
would
be
sensible
for
pierre
to
leave
petersburg
pierre
planned
to
go
to
his
southern
estates
and
occupy
himself
with
his
peasants
he
was
joyfully
contemplating
this
new
life
when
prince
vassily
unexpectedly
came
into
the
room
my
friend
what
have
you
done
in
moscow
why
did
you
quarrel
with
lelya
mon
cher
you
are
mistaken
said
prince
vassily
as
he
came
in
ive
found
out
everything
and
can
tell
you
for
certain
that
h233l232ne
is
as
innocent
before
you
as
christ
before
the
jews
pierre
was
about
to
reply
but
he
interrupted
him
and
why
didnt
you
turn
to
me
directly
and
simply
as
a
friend
i
know
it
all
i
understand
it
all
he
said
you
behaved
as
befits
a
man
who
cherishes
his
honor
perhaps
too
hastily
but
we
wont
discuss
that
only
understand
in
what
position
you
have
placed
her
and
myself
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
of
society
and
even
of
the
court
he
added
lowering
his
voice
shes
living
in
moscow
you
here
come
my
dear
he
pulled
his
hand
downwards
this
is
nothing
but
a
misunderstanding
i
think
you
feel
that
yourself
lets
write
her
a
letter
right
now
and
shell
come
here
everything
will
be
explained
and
all
this
talk
will
end
or
else
i
tell
you
you
may
very
well
suffer
for
it
my
dear
prince
vassily
looked
imposingly
at
pierre
i
have
it
from
good
sources
that
the
dowager
empress
is
taking
a
lively
interest
in
this
whole
affair
you
know
shes
very
favorable
to
h233l232ne
pierre
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
several
times
but
on
the
one
hand
prince
vassily
would
not
let
him
hastily
cutting
off
all
conversation
and
on
the
other
hand
pierre
himself
was
afraid
he
might
not
begin
speaking
in
the
tone
of
resolute
refusal
and
disagreement
in
which
he
was
firmly
resolved
to
answer
his
fatherinlaw
besides
the
words
of
the
masonic
rulebe
gentle
and
affablecame
to
his
mind
he
winced
blushed
rose
up
sank
back
working
on
himself
in
what
was
for
him
the
most
difficult
thing
in
lifeto
say
something
unpleasant
to
a
persons
face
to
say
something
that
the
person
whoever
he
might
be
was
not
expecting
he
was
so
used
to
obeying
prince
vassilys
tone
of
casual
selfassurance
that
this
time
too
he
felt
he
would
be
unable
to
oppose
it
yet
he
felt
that
his
whole
future
destiny
would
depend
on
what
he
said
right
now
whether
he
would
follow
the
old
former
way
or
the
new
one
which
had
been
shown
to
him
so
attractively
by
the
masons
and
on
which
he
firmly
believed
he
would
find
rebirth
into
a
new
life
well
my
dear
prince
vassily
said
jokingly
say
yes
to
me
and
ill
write
to
her
myself
and
we
can
kill
the
fatted
calf
but
prince
vassily
had
no
time
to
finish
his
joke
because
pierre
with
a
fury
in
his
face
that
was
reminiscent
of
his
father
without
looking
his
interlocutor
in
the
eye
said
in
a
quiet
whisper
prince
i
did
not
invite
you
herego
please
go
he
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
for
him
go
now
he
repeated
not
believing
himself
and
glad
of
the
expression
of
embarrassment
and
fear
that
appeared
on
prince
vassilys
face
whats
the
matter
with
you
are
you
ill
go
the
menacing
voice
said
once
more
and
prince
vassily
was
forced
to
leave
without
receiving
any
explanation
a
week
later
having
said
goodbye
to
his
new
mason
friends
and
having
left
them
large
sums
for
alms
pierre
went
off
to
his
estates
his
new
brothers
gave
him
letters
to
the
masons
of
kiev
and
odessa
and
promised
to
write
to
him
and
guide
him
in
his
new
activity
vi
the
affair
between
pierre
and
dolokhov
was
hushed
up
and
despite
the
sovereigns
severity
concerning
duels
neither
the
two
adversaries
nor
their
seconds
suffered
but
the
story
of
the
duel
confirmed
by
pierres
separation
from
his
wife
spread
in
society
pierre
who
had
been
viewed
indulgently
patronizingly
when
he
was
an
illegitimate
son
who
had
been
coddled
and
made
much
of
when
he
was
the
best
suitor
in
the
russian
empire
had
lost
much
in
the
opinion
of
society
after
his
marriage
when
brides
and
mothers
had
nothing
to
expect
from
him
the
more
so
as
he
neither
could
nor
would
seek
its
favor
now
he
alone
was
blamed
for
what
had
happened
it
was
said
that
he
was
a
jealous
dunderhead
subject
to
the
same
fits
of
bloodthirsty
rage
as
his
father
and
when
h233l232ne
returned
to
petersburg
after
pierres
departure
she
was
received
by
all
her
acquaintances
not
only
cordially
but
with
a
shade
of
deference
in
view
of

misfortunes
when
talk
turned
to
her
husband
h233l232ne
assumed
a
dignified
expression
which
shethough
without
understanding
its
significanceadopted
with
her
own
special
tact
this
expression
meant
that
she
was
resolved
to
endure
her
misfortune
without
complaining
and
that
her
husband
was
a
cross
sent
her
by
god
prince
vassily
voiced
his
opinion
with
more
candor
he
would
shrug
his
shoulders
when
the

turned

of

i
said
at

then
and
before
everyone
else
she
insisted
on
her
priority
that
he
is
a
crazy
young
man
spoiled
by
the
depraved
ideas
of
our
time
i
said
it
back
when
everyone
admired
him
and
he
had
just
come
from
abroad
and
remember
played
some
sort
of
marat
at
one
of
my
soir233es
and
how
did
it
end
even
then
i
didnt
want
this
marriage
and
predicted
everything
thats
happened
as
before
anna

on
free
evenings
held

anna

some

and
that
nowhere
as
at

did
the
level
of
the
political
thermometer
indicate
the
mood
of
legitimist
petersburg
court
society
so
clearly
and
firmly
at
the
end
of
1806
when
all
the
sad
details
had
been
received
of
napoleons
destruction
of
the
prussian
army
at
jena
and
auerst228dt
and
the
surrender
of
most
of
the

fortresses
when
our

had
already
entered

and

abandoned
by

of

of
the
enchanting
prince
ippolit
just
come
from
vienna
two
diplomats
the
aunt
a
young
man
who
in
this
drawing
room
simply
bore
the
title
of
un

de

de

a
newly
appointed
ladyinwaiting
with
her
mother
and
some
other
less
conspicuous
persons
the
person
to
whom
anna
pavlovna
treated
her
guests
as
a
novelty
that
evening
was
boris
drubetskoy
who
had
just
come
as
a
courier
from
the
prussian
army
where
he
was
an
adjutant
attached
to
a
very
important
person
the
level
of
the
political
thermometer
shown
to
the
company
that
evening
was
the
following
however
hard
all
european
sovereigns
and
military
leaders
try
to
pander
to
bonapartius
in
order
to
cause
me
and
us
in
general
unpleasantness
and
grief
our
opinion
of
bonapartius
cannot
change
we
will
not
cease
to
voice
our
unfeigned
way
of
thinking
on
that
account
and
we
can
only
say
to
the
prussian
king
and
others
so
much
the
worse
for
you
tu
las
voulu
georges
dandin
thats
all
we
can
say
that
was
what
the
political
thermometer
indicated
at
anna
pavlovnas
soir233e
when
boris
who
was
to
be
served
up
to
the
guests
entered
the
drawing
room
nearly
the
entire
company
had
gathered
and
the
conversation
guided
by
anna
pavlovna
had
to
do
with
our
diplomatic
relations
with
austria
and
the
hope
of
alliance
with
her
boris
in
a
dashing
adjutants
uniform
matured
fresh
and
redcheeked
walked
freely
into
the
drawing
room
and
was
duly
taken
to
greet
the
aunt
and
then
reattached
to
the
general
circle
anna
pavlovna
gave
him
her
dry
hand
to
kiss
introduced
him
to
some
strangers
and
whispered
her
definitions
of
them
to
him

of
the
one
who
bore
that
title
boris
during
the
time
of
his
service
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
anna
mikhailovna
his
own
tastes
and
the
qualities
of
his
reserved
character
had
managed
to
put
himself
in
a
most
advantageous
position
in
the
service
he
was
an
adjutant
to
a
very
important
person
had
a
very
important
mission
in
prussia
and
had
just
returned
from
there
as
a
courier
he
had
fully
adopted
the
unwritten
subordination
he
had
liked
so
much
in
olm252tz
according
to
which
an
ensign
could
have
incomparably
higher
standing
than
a
general
and
according
to
which
for
success
in
the
service
one
needed
not
efforts
not
labors
not
courage
not
perseverance
but
only
skill
in
dealing
with
those
who
give
rewards
for
serviceand
he
was
often
surprised
at
his
quick
success
and
at
how
others
could
fail
to
understand
it
thanks
to
this
discovery
his
whole
way
of
life
all
his
relations
with
former
acquaintances
and
all
his
plans
for
the
future
had
changed
completely
he
was
not
rich
but
he
spent
his
last
penny
to
dress
better
than
others
he
would
sooner
deprive
himself
of
many
pleasures
than
allow
himself
to
drive
in
a
shabby
carriage
or
appear
in
an
old
uniform
in
the
streets
of
petersburg
he
made
friends
and
sought
acquaintances
only
with
people
who
were
above
him
and
therefore
could
be
of
use
to
him
he
loved
petersburg
and
despised
moscow
the
memory
of
the
rostovs
house
and
his
childhood
love
for
natasha
was
disagreeable
to
him
and
he
had
never
once
visited
the
rostovs
since
joining
the
army
he
considered
his
presence
in
anna
pavlovnas
drawing
room
as
an
important
promotion
in
the
service
and
he
now
understood
at
once
his
role
there
and
left
it
to
anna
pavlovna
to
exploit
the
interest
contained
in
him
while
studying
every
person
attentively
and
evaluating
the
advantages
and
possibilities
of
making
friends
with
each
of
them
he
sat
down
in
the
place
shown
him
by
the
beautiful
h233l232ne
and
listened
to
the
general
conversation

anna

mixed
in

for
some
reason
she
pronounced
it
lurope
as
if
it
was
some
special
subtlety
of
the
french
language
which
she
could
allow
herself
when
speaking
with
a
frenchman
lurope

after
which
anna
pavlovna
led
the
conversation
towards
the
courage
and
firmness
of
the
prussian
king
in
order
to
bring
boris
into
things
boris
listened
attentively
to
what
was
being
said
waiting
for
his
turn
but
at
the
same
time
he
managed
to
glance
several
times
at
his
neighbor
the
beautiful
h233l232ne
who
several
times
met
the
eyes
of
the
handsome
young
adjutant
with
a
smile
quite
naturally
in
speaking
of
the
position
of
prussia
anna
pavlovna
asked
boris
to
tell
them
about
his
trip
to
glogau
and
the
situation
in
which
he
found
the
prussian
army
boris
unhurriedly
in
pure
and
correct
french
told
quite
a
few
interesting
details
about
the
army
and
the
court
taking
care
all
through
his
account
to
avoid
stating
his
own
opinion
concerning
the
facts
he
conveyed
for
some
time
boris
commanded
general
attention
and
anna
pavlovna
felt
that
the
novelty
she
had
treated
them
to
was
received
with
pleasure
by
all
the
guests
h233l232ne
paid
the
most
attention
of
all
to
boriss
story
she
asked
him
several
times
about
certain
details
of
his
trip
and
seemed
to
be
very
interested
in
the
position
of
the
prussian
army
as
soon
as
he
finished
she
turned
to
him
with
her
usual
smile
il
faut
absolument
que
vous
veniez
me
voir
she
said
to
him
in
a
tone
implying
that
for
certain
considerations
which
he
could
not
know
this
was
an
absolute
necessity
mardi

les

et

boris
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
and
was
about
to
get
into
conversation
with
her
when
anna
pavlovna
called
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
her
aunt
wanted
to
hear
him
you
do
know
her
husband
said
anna
pavlovna
closing
her
eyes
and
pointing
to
h233l232ne
with
a
sad
gesture
ah
shes
such
an
unhappy
and
lovely
woman
dont
speak
of
him
in
her
presence
please
dont
speak
of
him
its
too
painful
for
her
vii
when
boris
and
anna
pavlovna
returned
to
the
general
circle
the
conversation
there
had
been
taken
over
by
prince
ippolit
leaning
forward
in
his
armchair
he
said
le
roi
de
prusse
and
having
said
it
he
began
to
laugh
everyone
turned
to
him
le

asked
laughed
again
and
again
calmly
and
seriously
sat
back
in
the
depths
of
his
armchair
anna
pavlovna
waited
a
little
but
as
it
seemed
that
ippolit
decidedly
had
no
intention
of
saying
more
she
began
to
tell
about
how
the
godless
bonaparte
purloined
the
sword
of
frederick
the
great
in

she
began
but
ippolit
interrupted
her
with
the
words
le

and
again
as
soon
as
they
turned
to
him
he
apologized
and
fell
silent

ippolits
friend
addressed
him
resolutely

laughed
as
if
he
was
ashamed
of
his
own
laughter
non
ce
nest

je
voulais
dire
seulement
he
intended
to
repeat
a
joke
that
he
had
heard
in
vienna
and
that
he
had
been
trying
to
put
in
all
evening
je

boris
smiled
cautiously
so
that
his
smile
could
be
understood
either
as
mockery
or
as
approval
of
the
joke
depending
on
how
it
was
received
everyone
laughed

she
said
the
conversation
did
not
flag
all
evening
turning
mostly
around
political
news
at
the
end
of
the
evening
it
became
especially
lively
when
things
got
around

when
they
all
got
up
to
leave
h233l232ne
who
had
spoken
little
all
evening
again
turned
to
boris
with
the
request
and
the
gentle
meaningful
order
that
he
visit
her
on

its
very
necessary
for
me
she
said
with
a
smile
glancing
at
anna

and
anna

the
same
sad
smile
that
accompanied
her
words
when
her
exalted
patroness
was
mentioned

wish
it
seemed
as
though
from
certain
words
that
boris
had
spoken
that
evening
about
the
prussian
troops
h233l232ne
had
suddenly
discovered
the
necessity
of
seeing
him
it
was
as
if
she
were
promising
him
that
when
he
came
on
tuesday
she
would
explain
that
necessity
to
him
having
come
on
tuesday
evening
to
h233l232nes
magnificent
salon
boris
was
not
given
a
clear
explanation
of
why
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
come
there
were
other
guests
the
countess
spoke
little
to
him
and
only
as
he
kissed
her
hand
on
taking
his
leave
did
she
with
a
strange
absence
of
a
smile
unexpectedly
in
a
whisper
say
to
him
venez

during
this
stay
in

the
war
was
heating
up
and
its
theater
was
approaching
the
borders
of
russia
everywhere
curses
were
heard
on
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
bonapartius
militia
and
recruits
were
being
gathered
from
the
villages
and
divergent
news
kept
coming
from
the
theater
of
the
war
false
as
usual
and
therefore
reinterpreted
in
various
ways
the
life
of
old
prince
bolkonsky
prince
andrei
and
princess
marya
had
changed
much
since
1805
in
1806
the
old
prince
was
made
one
of
the
eight
commanders
in
chief
of
the
militia
then
appointed
all
over
russia
the
old
prince
despite
the
weakness
of
age
which
had
become
especially
noticeable
during
the
time
when
he
counted
his
son
as
killed
did
not
believe
he
had
the
right
to
refuse
the
function
assigned
to
him
by
the
sovereign
himself
and
this
activity
newly
opened
up
for
him
roused
and
strengthened
him
he
traveled
continually
around
the
three
provinces
entrusted
to
him
he
was
thorough
to
the
point
of
pedantry
in
his
duties
strict
to
the
point
of
cruelty
with
his
subordinates
and
personally
entered
into
the
minutest
details
of
things
princess
marya
now
stopped
taking
lessons
in
mathematics
from
her
father
and
merely
went
to
her
fathers
study
in
the
mornings
whenever
he
was
at
home
accompanied
by
the
wet
nurse
and
little
prince
nikolai
as
his
grandfather
called
him
the
nursing
prince
nikolai
lived
with
his
wet
nurse
and
the
nanny
savishna
in
the
rooms
of
the
late
princess
and
princess
marya
spent
the
greater
the
day
in
the
nursery
replacing
her
little
nephews
mother
as
well
as
she
could
mlle
bourienne
also
seemed
to
love
the
boy
passionately
and
princess
marya
often
depriving
herself
yielded
to
her
friend
the
pleasure
of
dandling
the
little
angel
as
she
called
her
nephew
and
playing
with
him
near
the
altar
of
the
church
at
bald
hills
there
was
a
chapel
over
the
grave
of
the
little
princess
and
in
the
chapel
had
been
placed
a
marble
memorial
brought
from
italy
in
the
form
of
an
angel
with
spread
wings
ready
to
soar
into
the
sky
the
angel
had
a
slightly
raised
upper
lip
as
if
he
was
about
to
smile
and
once
as
they
were
leaving
the
chapel
prince
andrei
and
princess
marya
confessed
to
each
other
that
the
angels
face
strangely
reminded
them
of
the
face
of
the
deceased
woman
but
stranger
still
was
something
that
prince
andrei
did
not
tell
his
sister
which
was
that
in
the
expression
which
the
artist
had
chanced
to
give
the
angels
face
prince
andrei
read
the
same
words
of
meek
reproach
he
had
once
read
on
his
dead
wifes
face
ah
why
have
you
done
this
to
me
soon
after
prince
andreis
return
the
old
prince
separated
his
sons
share
of
the
inheritance
and
gave
him
bogucharovo
a
large
estate
thirty
miles
from
bald
hills
partly
on
account
of
the
painful
memories
connected
with
bald
hills
partly
because
prince
andrei
did
not
always
feel
able
to
bear
calmly
with
his
fathers
character
and
partly
because
he
needed
solitude
prince
andrei
took
advantage
of
bogucharovo
began
building
and
spent
most
of
his
time
there
after
the
austerlitz
campaign
prince
andrei
had
firmly
decided
never
to
serve
in
the
army
again
and
when
war
began
and
everyone
had
to
serve
he
took
a
post
raising
militia
under
his
fathers
leadership
in
order
to
get
out
of
active
service
it
was
as
if
after
the
campaign
of
1805
the
old
prince
and
his
son
had
exchanged
roles
the
old
prince
roused
by
his
activity
expected
nothing
but
good
from
the
present
campaign
prince
andrei
on
the
contrary
not
taking
the
war
and
regretting
it
deep
in
his
heart
saw
nothing
but
bad
on
the
twentysixth
of
february
1807
the
old
prince
left
on
his
rounds
prince
andrei
stayed
at
bald
hills
as
he
did
most
often
during
his
fathers
absence
little
nikolushka
had
been
ill
for
three
days
now
the
coachman
who
drove
the
old
prince
came
back
from
town
bringing
papers
and
letters
for
prince
andrei
the
valet
with
the
letters
did
not
find
the
young
prince
in
his
study
and
went
to
princess
maryas
side
but
he
was
not
there
either
the
valet
was
told
that
the
prince
had
gone
to
the
nursery
if
you
please
your
excellency
petrusha
has
come
with
papers
said
one
of
the
maids
who
assisted
the
nanny
addressing
prince
andrei
who
was
sitting
on
a
childs
little
chair
frowning
his
hands
trembling
pouring
drops
of
medicine
from
a
vial
into
a
glass
half
filled
with
water
whats
that
he
said
crossly
and
his
hand
carelessly
twitched
pouring
an
extra
number
of
drops
from
the
vial
into
the
glass
he
dumped
the
medicine
on
the
floor
and
asked
for
more
water
the
maid
gave
it
to
him
in
the
room
stood
a
babys
crib
two
trunks
two
armchairs
a
table
and
a
childs
table
with
the
little
chair
on
which
prince
andrei
was
sitting
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
a
candle
burned
on
the
table
screened
by
a
bound
music
book
to
shield
the
bed
from
the
light
my
friend
said
princess
marya
addressing
her
brother
from
beside
the
crib
where
she
was
standing
its
better
to
waitlater
ah
for
pitys
sake
you
keep
saying
stupid
things
and
you
keep
wanting
to
waitsee
weve
waited
said
prince
andrei
in
a
spiteful
whisper
clearly
with
the
wish
to
sting
his
sister
my
friend
really
its
better
not
to
wake
him
hes
asleep
the
princess
said
in
a
pleading
voice
prince
andrei
got
up
and
holding
the
glass
tiptoed
towards
the
crib
so
you
really
think
we
shouldnt
wake
him
he
said
hesitantly
as
you
wishreallyi
thinkbut
as
you
wish
said
princess
marya
clearly
abashed
and
ashamed
that
her
opinion
had
triumphed
she
pointed
to
the
maid
who
was
calling
to
her
brother
in
a
whisper
it
was
the
second
night
that
the
two
of
them
had
not
slept
looking
after
the
boy
who
was
burning
with
fever
for
two
whole
days
not
trusting
their
house
doctor
and
expecting
the
one
they
had
sent
for
from
town
they
had
been
trying
now
one
now
another
remedy
worn
out
by
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
they
shifted
their
grief
onto
each
other
reproached
each
other
and
quarreled
petrushas
here
with
papers
from
your
father
the
girl
whispered
prince
andrei
stepped
out
well
what
now
he
said
crossly
and
having
listened
to
the
verbal
orders
from
his
father
and
taking
the
envelopes
and
his
fathers
letter
he
went
back
to
the
nursery
well
how
is
he
asked
prince
andrei
still
the
same
just
wait
for
gods
sake
karl
ivanych
always
says
that
sleep
is
best
of
all
princess
marya
whispered
with
a
sigh
prince
andrei
went
over
to
the
baby
and
felt
him
he
was
burning
devil
take
you
and
your
karl
ivanych
he
picked
up
the
glass
with
the
drops
of
medicine
in
it
and
went
back
again
andr233
dont
said
princess
marya
but
he
glowered
at
her
angrily
and
at
the
same
time
sufferingly
and
bent
over
the
baby
with
the
glass
but
i
want
it
he
said
well
give
it
to
him
i
beg
you
princess
marya
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
took
the
glass
obediently
and
calling
to
the
nanny
began
to
administer
the
medicine
the
baby
cried
and
wheezed
prince
andrei
wincing
clutched
his
head
went
out
and
sat
on
a
sofa
in
the
next
room
he
still
had
the
letters
in
his
hand
he
opened
them
mechanically
and
began
to
read
on
blue
paper
in
his
large
elongated
hand
occasionally
using
abbreviations
the
old
prince
wrote
the
following
i
have
this
moment
received
most
joyful
news
through
a
courier
if
it
is
not
a
lie
bennigsen
is
supposed
to
have
won
a
full
victory
over
bonapartius
at
preussischeylau
in
petersburg
there
is
general
rejoicing
and
no
end
of
rewards
have
been
sent
to
the
army
though
he
is
a
german
i
congratulate
him
the
commander
in
korchevo
a
certain
khandrikov
is
doing
something
i
cannot
fathom
up
to
now
additional
men
and
provisions
have
not
been
delivered
gallop
there
at
once
and
tell
him
that
his
head
will
roll
unless
everything
is
done
within
a
week
i
have
also
received
a
letter
about
the
battle
of
preussischeylau
from
petenka
who
took
iteverything
is
true
when
those
who
should
not
interfere
do
not
interfere
even
a
german
can
beat
bonapartius
they
say
he
is
fleeing
in
great
disarray
see
that
you
gallop
to
korchevo
without
delay
and
carry
out
my
orders
prince
andrei
sighed
and
opened
another
envelope
this
was
a
twopage
closely
written
letter
from
bilibin
he
folded
it
without
reading
it
and
read
his
fathers
letter
again
ending
with
the
words
gallop
to
korchevo
and
carry
out
my
orders
no
excuse
me
i
wont
go
now
not
until
the
baby
gets
well
he
thought
and
going
to
the
door
he
peeked
into
the
nursery
princess
marya
was
still
standing
by
the
crib
gently
rocking
the
baby
yes
whats
that
other
unpleasantness
he
writes
prince
andrei
recalled
the
contents
of
his
fathers
letter
yes
our
side
has
won
a
victory
over
bonaparte
precisely
when
im
not
serving
yes
yes
he
keeps
making
fun
of
mewell
hes
welcome
to
and
he
began
to
read
bilibins
letter
written
in
french
he
read
not
understanding
half
of
it
read
only
so
as
to
stop
thinking
for
at
least
a
minute
about
what
he
had
been
thinking
of
exclusively
and
painfully
for
all
too
long
ix
bilibin
was
now
attached
to
army
headquarters
in
the
capacity
of
a
diplomatic
functionary
and
though
he
wrote
in
french
with
french
jokes
and
turns
of
phrase
he
described
the
whole
campaign
with
an
exclusively
russian
fearlessness
of
selfcondemnation
and
selfderision
bilibin
wrote
that
his
diplomatic
discr233tion
tormented
him
and
that
he
was
happy
to
have
a
faithful
correspondent
in
prince
andrei
before
whom
he
could
pour
out
all
the
bile
that
had
accumulated
in
him
while
watching
what
was
happening
in
the
army
the
letter
was
an
old
one
from
before
the
battle
of
preussischeylau
bilibin
wrote

le
fameux
ordre
du
jour
au
g233n233ral
bennigsen
i
am
wounded
i
cannot
mount
a
horse
and
therefore
cannot
command
an
army
you
have
brought
your
crushed
corps
darm233e
to
pultusk
here
it
is
exposed
without
firewood
and
without
forage
and
thus
in
need
of
help
and
since
you
yourself
were
in
touch
with
count
buxh246wden
yesterday
thought
should
be
given
to
retreating
to
our
border
which
should
be
done
today
from
all
this
riding
around
233critil
224
lempereur
i
have
got
a
saddle
sore
which
on
top
of
my
previous
bandages
totally
prevents
me
from
riding
and
commanding
such
a
vast
army
and
therefore
i
have
turned
over
the
command
to
the
general
next
in
seniority
to
myself
count
buxh246wden
sending
him
all
my
staff
and
everything
pertaining
to
it
advising
them
if
there
is
no
bread
to
retreat
further
into
the
interior
of
prussia
because
there
was
only
enough
bread
left
for
one
day
and
some
regiments
had
none
as
division
commanders
ostermann
and
sedmoretsky
announced
and
everything
the
peasants
had
has
been
eaten
and
i
myself
am
staying
in
a
hospital
in
ostrolenka
until
i
am
cured
your
most
devoted
servant
submits
this
report
dating
it
and
observing
that
if
the
army
remains
in
its
present
bivouac
for
another
two
weeks
by
spring
we
will
not
have
one
healthy
man
left
dismiss
an
old
man
to
his
country
estates
who
is
left
disgraced
as
it
is
that
he
cannot
fulfill
the
great
and
glorious
destiny
for
which
he
was
chosen
i
shall
await
your
most
merciful
permission
here
in
the
hospital
to
avoid
playing
the
role
of
a
scrivener
rather
than
a
commander
of
troops
my
removal
from
the
army
will
cause
no
greater
stir
than
if
a
blind
man
was
leaving
it
there
are
thousands
like

began
by
reading
with
his
eyes
alone
but
then
involuntarily
though
he
knew
how
far
bilibin
was
to
be
trusted
became
more
and
interested
in
what
he
was
reading
having
read
to
this
point
he
crumpled
the
letter
and
threw
it
down
it
was
not
what
he
read
in
the
letter
that
made
him
angry
what
made
him
angry
was
that
the
life
there
now
foreign
to
him
could
excite
him
he
closed
his
eyes
rubbed
his
forehead
with
his
hand
as
if
driving
away
all
concern
for
what
he
had
read
and
began
listening
to
what
was
happening
in
the
nursery
suddenly
he
seemed
to
hear
some
strange
noise
behind
the
door
fear
came
over
him
he
was
afraid
something
had
happened
to
the
baby
while
he
was
reading
the
letter
he
tiptoed
to
the
door
of
the
nursery
and
opened
it
the
moment
he
went
in
he
saw
that
the
nanny
was
hiding
something
from
him
with
a
frightened
look
and
that
princess
marya
was
no
longer
by
the
crib
my
friend
he
heard
behind
him
what
sounded
like
the
desperate
whisper
of
princess
marya
as
often
happens
after
long
sleeplessness
and
long
anxiety
a
groundless
fear
came
over
him
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
baby
had
died
everything
he
saw
and
heard
seemed
to
him
to
confirm
his
fear
its
all
over
he
thought
and
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
bewildered
he
went
over
to
the
crib
certain
that
he
would
find
it
empty
that
the
nanny
was
hiding
the
dead
baby
he
opened
the
curtain
and
for
a
time
his
frightened
unfocused
eyes
could
not
find
the
baby
at
last
he
saw
him
the
redcheeked
boy
lay
sprawled
across
the
crib
his
head
lower
than
the
pillow
smacking
and
moving
his
lips
in
his
sleep
and
breathing
regularly
prince
andrei
on
seeing
the
boy
was
as
glad
as
if
he
had
already
lost
him
he
bent
down
and
as
his
sister
had
taught
him
tested
with
his
lips
whether
the
baby
had
a
fever
the
tender
forehead
was
moist
he
touched
his
head
with
his
handeven
the
hair
was
wet
the
baby
had
sweated
so
much
not
only
had
he
not
died
but
it
was
obvious
now
that
the
crisis
was
past
and
that
he
was
getting
well
prince
andrei
wanted
to
snatch
up
to
squeeze
to
clutch
to
his
heart
this
helpless
little
being
he
did
not
dare
to
do
it
he
stood
over
him
gazed
at
his
head
his
arms
his
legs
outlined
under
the
blanket
he
heard
a
rustling
beside
him
and
some
shadow
appeared
under
the
canopy
of
the
crib
he
did
not
turn
and
gazing
at
the
babys
face
kept
listening
to
his
regular
breathing
the
dark
shadow
was
princess
marya
who
had
come
over
to
the
crib
with
inaudible
steps
raised
the
canopy
and
lowered
it
behind
her
prince
andrei
recognized
her
without
turning
to
look
and
reached
his
hand
towards
her
she
pressed
his
hand
hes
been
sweating
said
prince
andrei
i
was
coming
to
tell
you
that
the
baby
stirred
slightly
in
his
sleep
smiled
and
rubbed
his
forehead
against
the
pillow
prince
andrei
looked
at
his
sister
princess
maryas
luminous
eyes
in
the
dim
halflight
of
the
canopy
glistened
more
than
usual
from
the
happy
tears
that
welled
up
in
them
princess
marya
leaned
towards
her
brother
and
kissed
him
catching
slightly
in
the
canopy
of
the
crib
they
shook
their
fingers
at
each
other
and
stood
a
little
longer
in
the
dim
light
of
the
canopy
as
if
reluctant
to
that
world
in
which
the
three
of
them
were
separated
from
everything
on
earth
prince
andrei
was
the
first
to
leave
the
crib
his
hair
tangling
in
the
muslin
of
the
canopy
yes
this
is
the
one
thing
left
to
me
now
he
said
with
a
sigh
x
soon
after
he
was
received
into
the
brotherhood
of
the
masons
pierre
left
for
the
province
of
kiev
where
the
greater
his
peasants
were
with
a
full
set
of
instructions
he
had
written
out
for
himself
about
what
he
was
to
do
on
his
estates
on
reaching
kiev
pierre
summoned
all
his
stewards
to
the
main
office
and
explained
his
intentions
and
wishes
to
them
he
told
them
that
measures
would
immediately
be
taken
for
the
complete
liberation
of
the
peasants
from
bondage
that
meanwhile
the
peasants
should
not
be
overburdened
with
work
that
women
with
children
should
not
be
sent
to
work
that
the
peasants
should
be
given
assistance
that
punishments
should
be
administered
hortatorily
not
corporeally
that
there
should
be
hospitals
almshouses
and
schools
in
each
village
some
of
the
stewards
there
were
halfliterate
managers
among
them
listened
fearfully
taking
what
he
said
to
imply
that
the
young
count
was
displeased
with
their
stewardship
and
their
concealing
of
money
others
after
the
first
fright
were
amused
by
pierres
lisp
and
the
new
words
they
had
never
heard
before
a
third
group
simply
took
pleasure
in
hearing
how
the
master
spoke
a
fourth
group
the
most
intelligent
the
head
steward
among
them
understood
from
his
speech
how
they
ought
to
treat
the
master
in
order
to
achieve
their
own
aims
the
head
steward
expressed
great
sympathy
with
pierres
intentions
but
he
observed
that
besides
these
transformations
it
was
generally
necessary
to
take
care
of
things
which
were
in
a
bad
state
despite
count
bezukhovs
enormous
wealth
ever
since
pierre
had
received
itand
he
received
so
it
was
said
a
yearly
income
of
five
hundred
thousandhe
had
felt
himself
much
less
rich
than
when
he
had
received
his
ten
thousand
from
the
late
count
in
general
terms
he
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
following
budget
around
eighty
thousand
was
paid
to
the
council
for
all
the
estates
around
thirty
thousand
went
to
the
upkeep
of
the
suburban
moscow
estate
the
moscow
house
and
the
princesses
around
fifteen
thousand
was
distributed
in
pensions
and
the
same
amount
to
charitable
institutions
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
was
sent
to
the
countess
for
her
expenses
around
seventy
thousand
was
paid
as
interest
on
debts
the
building
of
a
new
church
already
begun
had
been
costing
around
ten
thousand
over
the
past
two
years
the
rest
around
a
hundred
thousand
got
spent
he
did
not
know
how
himself
and
he
was
obliged
to
borrow
almost
every
year
besides
that
every
year
the
head
steward
wrote
now
about
fires
now
about
poor
harvests
now
about
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
mills
and
factories
and
so
the
first
thing
facing
pierre
was
that
for
which
he
had
least
ability
or
inclinationbusiness
matters
every
day
pierre
busied
himself
with
his
head
steward
but
he
felt
that
his
busying
did
not
move
things
one
step
foward
he
felt
that
his
busying
went
on
independently
of
things
that
it
did
not
mesh
with
things
and
did
not
make
them
move
on
the
one
hand
the
head
steward
presenting
things
in
the
worst
light
showed
pierre
the
necessity
of
paying
off
debts
and
undertaking
new
works
using
serf
labor
to
which
pierre
would
not
agree
on
the
other
hand
pierre
demanded
a
start
to
the
business
of
liberation
against
which
the
steward
advanced
the
necessity
of
first
paying
the
debt
to
the
trust
council
and
hence
the
impossibility
of
a
speedy
liberation
the
steward
did
not
say
it
was
completely
impossible
to
achieve
that
goal
he
suggested
selling
the
woodlands
in
kostroma
province
selling
the
bottomlands
and
the
crimean
estate
but
all
these
operations
as
the
steward
spoke
of
them
became
bound
up
with
such
a
complexity
of
processes
of
lifting
prohibitions
requesting
permissions
and
so
on
that
pierre
was
at
a
loss
and
only
said
to
him
yes
yes
do
that
pierre
did
not
have
the
practical
tenacity
that
would
have
given
him
the
possibility
of
undertaking
the
business
directly
and
therefore
he
did
not
like
it
and
only
tried
to
pretend
to
the
steward
that
he
was
occupied
with
it
and
the
steward
tried
to
pretend
to
the
count
that
he
considered
this
occupation
quite
useful
for
the
master
and
inconvenient
for
himself
in
the
big
town
acquaintances
turned
up
strangers
hastened
to
make
the
acquaintance
and
greet
cordially
the
newly
arrived
rich
man
the
biggest
proprietor
in
the
province
temptations
in
connection
with
pierres
main
weakness
the
one
he
had
confessed
when
he
was
being
received
into
the
lodge
were
also
so
strong
that
pierre
could
not
resist
them
again
whole
days
weeks
months
of
pierres
life
passed
busily
taken
up
with
soir233es
dinners
lunches
balls
giving
him
no
time
to
recover
his
senses
just
as
in
petersburg
instead
of
the
new
life
pierre
had
hoped
to
lead
he
still
lived
the
same
life
as
before
only
in
different
surroundings
of
the
three
precepts
of
masonry
pierre
realized
that
he
was
not
fulfilling
the
one
which
required
every
mason
to
be
an
example
of
the
moral
life
and
of
the
seven
virtues
he
was
totally
lacking
in
two
good
character
and
the
love
of
death
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
that
he
was
fulfilling
another
duty
insteadthe
setting
to
rights
of
the
human
raceand
had
other
virtueslove
of
his
neighbor
and
especially
generosity
in
the
spring
of
1807
pierre
decided
to
go
back
to
petersburg
on
the
way
back
he
intended
to
visit
all
his
estates
and
personally
ascertain
what
of
all
he
had
prescribed
had
been
done
and
what
the
situation
now
was
of
the
people
whom
god
had
entrusted
to
him
and
whose
benefactor
he
was
trying
to
be
the
stewardwho
considered
all
the
young
counts
ventures
near
madness
unprofitable
for
himself
for
pierre
and
for
the
peasantsmade
concessions
continuing
to
present
the
business
of
emancipation
as
impossible
he
ordered
the
construction
of
large
buildings
for
schools
hospitals
and
almshouses
on
all
the
estates
had
receptions
prepared
everywhere
for
the
masters
arrival
not
sumptuously
festive
which
he
knew
pierre
would
not
like
but
of
religious
thanksgiving
with
icons
and
bread
and
salt
precisely
such
as
would
impress
and
deceive
the
master
as
he
understood
him
the
southern
spring
the
comfortable
quick
travel
in
a
viennese
carriage
and
the
solitude
on
the
way
worked
joyfully
on
pierre
the
estates
he
had
not
yet
been
to
were
one
more
picturesque
than
the
other
the
people
everywhere
seemed
prosperous
and
touchingly
grateful
for
the
benefactions
he
had
done
them
everywhere
there
were
welcomes
which
though
they
sometimes
embarrassed
pierre
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
called
up
a
joyful
feeling
in
him
in
one
place
the
peasants
offered
him
bread
and
salt
and
the
icon
of
peter
and
paul
and
asked
his
permission
in
honor
of
his
patron
saints
peter
and
paul
as
a
sign
of
love
and
gratitude
for
his
benefactions
to
build
a
new
chapel
in
the
church
at
their
own
expense
in
another
place
he
was
met
by
women
with
nursing
babies
who
thanked
him
for
their
deliverance
from
hard
work
on
a
third
estate
he
was
met
by
the
priest
with
a
cross
surrounded
by
children
whom
thanks
to
the
count
he
was
instructing
in
reading
writing
and
religion
on
all
the
estates
pierre
saw
with
his
own
eyes
stone
buildings
under
construction
or
already
constructed
according
to
the
same
plan
to
serve
as
hospitals
schools
and
almshouses
which
were
to
be
opened
in
a
short
time
everywhere
pierre
saw
the
stewards
reports
on
the
reduction
of
the
corv233e
compared
to
previous
norms
and
heard
touching
thanks
for
it
from
deputations
of
peasants
in
blue
kaftans
pierre
did
not
know
that
the
village
where
he
was
offered
bread
and
salt
and
where
a
chapel
to
peter
and
paul
was
being
built
was
a
market
village
with
a
fair
on
st
peters
day
that
the
chapel
had
been
begun
long
ago
by
the
wealthy
peasants
who
were
the
ones
that
welcomed
him
and
that
ninetenths
of
the
peasants
in
that
village
were
completely
destitute
he
did
not
know
that
since
on
his
orders
women
with
nursing
babies
were
no
longer
sent
to
do
corv233e
these
same
women
had
to
do
still
harder
work
on
their
own
land
he
did
not
know
that
the
priest
who
met
him
with
the
cross
burdened
the
peasants
with
his
exactions
and
that
the
pupils
gathered
around
him
had
been
sent
off
with
tears
by
their
parents
and
were
bought
back
for
large
sums
of
money
he
did
not
know
that
the
stone
buildings
were
constructed
to
plan
by
his
own
workers
and
increased
their
corv233e
which
was
only
reduced
on
paper
he
did
not
know
that
where
a
steward
showed
him
in
the
books
that
the
quitrent
had
been
reduced
by
a
third
as
he
had
ordered
the
corv233e
had
been
augmented
by
half
and
therefore
pierre
was
delighted
by
his
visits
to
the
estates
and
returned
fully
to
that
philanthropic
state
of
mind
in
which
he
had
left
petersburg
and
wrote
rapturous
letters
to
his
mentorbrother
as
he
called
the
grand
master
how
easy
it
is
how
little
effort
it
takes
to
do
so
much
good
thought
pierre
and
how
little
we
care
about
it
he
was
happy
with
the
gratitude
shown
him
but
ashamed
as
he
received
it
this
gratitude
reminded
him
how
much
more
he
could
do
for
these
simple
good
people
the
steward
a
very
stupid
but
cunning
man
understood
the
intelligent
but
na239ve
count
perfectly
and
played
with
him
as
with
a
toy
when
he
saw
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
on
pierre
he
addressed
him
more
resolutely
with
arguments
about
the
impossibility
and
above
all
the
needlessness
of
emancipating
the
peasants
who
were
perfectly
happy
even
without
that
in
his
heart
of
hearts
pierre
agreed
with
the
steward
that
it
was
hard
to
imagine
happier
people
and
that
god
knows
what
awaited
them
in
freedom
yet
pierre
insisted
albeit
reluctantly
on
what
he
considered
right
the
steward
promised
to
put
all
his
powers
to
use
in
fulfilling
the
counts
will
clearly
understanding
that
the
count
not
only
would
never
be
able
to
check
on
whether
all
the
measures
had
been
taken
for
selling
the
woodlands
and
estates
so
as
to
pay
off
the
council
but
would
probably
never
ask
and
never
find
out
that
the
buildings
constructed
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
peasants
went
on
giving
in
work
and
money
all
that
peasants
gave
other
mastersthat
is
all
they
could
xi
returning
from
his
southern
journey
in
the
happiest
state
of
mind
pierre
carried
out
a
longstanding
intention
of
histo
go
and
visit
his
friend
bolkonsky
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
years
having
learned
at
the
last
posting
station
that
prince
andrei
was
not
at
bald
hills
but
at
his
newly
allotted
estate
pierre
went
to
him
there
bogucharovo
lay
in
flat
unattractive
country
covered
with
fields
and
first
and
secondgrowth
stands
of
fir
and
birch
the
manor
stood
at
the
end
of
a
village
that
stretched
along
the
high
road
behind
a
newly
dug
wellfilled
pond
its
banks
not
yet
overgrown
with
grass
in
the
middle
of
a
young
woods
amidst
which
stood
a
few
big
pines
the
manor
consisted
of
a
threshing
floor
outbuildings
stables
a
bathhouse
a
cottage
and
a
big
stone
house
with
a
semicircular
fa231ade
which
was
still
under
construction
around
the
house
a
young
garden
was
planted
the
fences
were
sturdy
and
new
under
a
shed
stood
two
fire
hoses
and
a
barrel
painted
green
the
paths
were
straight
the
bridges
strong
with
handrails
everything
bore
the
stamp
of
neatness
and
efficiency
to
the
question
of
where
the
prince
lived
some
domestics
he
met
pointed
him
to
the
small
new
cottage
that
stood
just
by
the
pond
anton
prince
andreis
old
tutor
helped
pierre
out
of
the
carriage
said
that
the
prince
was
at
home
and
led
him
to
a
clean
little
front
hall
pierre
was
struck
by
the
modesty
of
this
small
though
clean
house
after
those
magnificent
conditions
in
which
he
had
last
seen
his
friend
in
petersburg
he
went
quickly
into
the
little
reception
room
unplastered
and
still
smelling
of
pine
and
wanted
to
go
further
but
anton
ran
ahead
on
tiptoe
and
knocked
on
the
door
well
what
is
it
came
a
sharp
unpleasant
voice
a
visitor
replied
anton
ask
him
to
wait
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
chair
being
moved
pierre
went
up
to
the
door
with
quick
steps
and
ran
facetoface
into
the
frowning
and
aged
prince
andrei
who
was
coming
out
to
him
pierre
embraced
him
and
raising
his
spectacles
kissed
him
on
the
cheeks
and
looked
at
him
close
up
how
unexpected
im
very
glad
said
prince
andrei
pierre
said
nothing
he
looked
at
his
friend
in
astonishment
and
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
he
was
struck
by
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
prince
andrei
his
words
were
affectionate
there
was
a
smile
on
prince
andreis
lips
and
face
but
his
gaze
was
extinguished
dead
and
despite
his
obvious
desire
prince
andrei
could
not
give
it
a
joyful
and
merry
luster
it
was
not
that
his
friend
had
grown
thinner
paler
more
mature
it
was
this
gaze
and
the
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
expressive
of
a
long
concentration
on
some
one
thing
which
struck
and
alienated
pierre
until
he
got
used
to
them
in
this
meeting
after
a
long
separation
as
always
happens
the
conversation
could
not
settle
on
anything
for
a
long
time
they
asked
and
gave
brief
replies
about
things
they
knew
should
have
been
discussed
at
length
at
last
the
conversation
gradually
began
to
dwell
on
what
had
previously
been
said
in
fragments
on
questions
of
past
life
on
plans
for
the
future
on
pierres
journey
on
his
occupations
on
the
war
and
so
on
the
concentration
and
dejection
pierre
had
noticed
in
prince
andreis
eyes
were
now
expressed
still
more
strongly
in
the
smile
with
which
he
listened
to
pierre
especially
when
pierre
spoke
with
animated
joy
about
his
past
or
future
it
was
as
if
prince
andrei
would
have
liked
to
enter
into
what
he
was
saying
but
could
not
pierre
was
beginning
to
feel
that
raptures
dreams
hopes
for
happiness
and
the
good
were
improper
in
front
of
prince
andrei
he
was
ashamed
to
voice
all
his
new
masonic
thoughts
especially
renewed
and
stirred
up
in
him
by
his
last
journey
he
restrained
himself
he
was
afraid
of
being
na239ve
along
with
that
he
had
an
irrepressible
desire
to
show
his
friend
the
more
quickly
that
he
was
now
quite
a
different
better
pierre
than
the
one
he
had
been
in
petersburg
i
cant
tell
you
how
much
ive
lived
through
in
this
time
i
wouldnt
recognize
myself
yes
weve
changed
very
much
very
much
since
then
said
prince
andrei
well
and
you
asked
pierre
what
are
your
plans
plans
prince
andrei
repeated
ironically
my
plans
he
repeated
as
if
astonished
at
the
meaning
of
such
a
word
as
you
see
im
building
by
next
year
i
want
to
have
moved
completely
pierre
peered
silently
and
intently
into
andreis
aged
face
no
im
asking
said
pierre
but
prince
andrei
interrupted
him
why
talk
about
myselfyou
tell
me
tell
me
about
your
journey
and
all
you
did
there
on
your
estates
pierre
began
telling
about
what
he
had
done
on
his
estates
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
hide
his
own
share
in
the
improvements
he
had
made
prince
andrei
prompted
pierre
beforehand
several
times
in
what
he
was
telling
as
if
everything
pierre
had
done
was
a
longknown
story
and
he
listened
not
only
without
interest
but
even
as
if
ashamed
at
what
pierre
was
telling
him
pierre
felt
awkward
and
even
oppressed
in
his
friends
company
he
fell
silent
well
the
thing
is
dear
heart
said
prince
andrei
who
obviously
also
felt
oppressed
and
embarrassed
with
his
visitor
im
on
bivouac
here
ive
just
come
to
have
a
look
and
tonight
im
going
to
my
sisters
ill
introduce
you
to
them
but
it
seems
you
know
her
he
said
obviously
entertaining
a
visitor
with
whom
he
no
longer
felt
anything
in
common
well
go
after
dinner
and
now
would
you
like
to
look
over
my
estate
they
went
out
and
spent
the
time
before
dinner
discussing
political
news
and
mutual
acquaintances
like
people
who
have
little
closeness
to
each
other
prince
andrei
showed
some
animation
and
interest
only
when
he
talked
about
the
new
estate
he
was
setting
up
and
his
construction
projects
but
here
too
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
on
the
scaffolding
as
prince
andrei
was
describing
to
pierre
the
future
layout
of
the
house
he
suddenly
stopped
however
theres
nothing
interesting
in
it
lets
have
dinner
and
go
over
dinner
the
conversation
turned
to
pierres
marriage
i
was
very
surprised
when
i
heard
of
it
said
prince
andrei
pierre
blushed
as
he
always
blushed
about
that
and
said
hastily
some
day
ill
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
but
you
know
its
all
over
and
forever
forever
said
prince
andrei
nothing
is
forever
but
you
do
know
how
it
all
ended
you
heard
about
the
duel
yes
you
went
through
that
too
the
one
thing
i
thank
god
for
is
that
i
didnt
kill
the
man
said
pierre
why
so
asked
prince
andrei
its
even
very
good
to
kill
a
vicious
dog
no
to
kill
a
man
is
bad
its
wrong
why
is
it
wrong
prince
andrei
repeated
its
not
given
to
people
to
judge
whats
right
or
wrong
people
have
eternally
been
mistaken
and
will
be
mistaken
and
in
nothing
more
so
than
in
what
they
consider
right
and
wrong
whats
evil
for
another
person
is
wrong
said
pierre
pleased
to
feel
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
prince
andrei
was
becoming
animated
and
was
beginning
to
talk
and
wanted
to
speak
out
everything
that
had
made
him
the
way
he
was
now
but
who
has
told
you
whats
evil
for
another
person
he
asked
evil
evil
said
pierre
we
all
know
whats
evil
for
us
yes
we
know
but
what
i
know
as
evil
for
myself
i
cannot
do
to
another
person
prince
andrei
was
speaking
more
and
more
animatedly
clearly
wishing
to
voice
his
new
view
of
things
to
pierre
he
spoke
in
french
je
ne
connais
dans
la
vie
que
deux
maux
bien
r233els
cest
le
remords
et
la
maladie
il
nest
de
bien
que
labsence
de
ces
maux
to
live
for
myself
only
avoiding
these
two
evilsthat
is
all
my
wisdom
now
and
love
of
ones
neighbor
and
selfsacrifice
pierre
began
no
i
cant
agree
with
you
to
live
only
so
as
not
to
do
evil
so
as
not
to
repent
is
too
little
i
used
to
live
that
way
i
lived
for
myself
and
i
ruined
my
life
and
only
now
when
i
live
or
at
least
try
to
live
pierre
corrected
himself
out
of
modesty
for
others
only
now
have
i
understood
all
the
happiness
of
life
no
i
wont
agree
with
you
and
you
dont
really
think
what
youre
saying
prince
andrei
silently
gazed
at
pierre
with
a
mocking
smile
youll
be
seeing
my
sister
princess
marya
youll
get
along
well
with
her
he
said
maybe
youre
right
for
yourself
he
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
but
each
man
lives
in
his
own
way
you
lived
for
yourself
and
you
say
with
that
you
almost
ruined
your
life
and
knew
happiness
only
when
you
began
to
live
for
others
but
i
experienced
the
opposite
i
used
to
live
for
glory
what
is
glory
the
same
as
love
for
others
the
desire
to
do
something
for
them
the
desire
for
their
praise
so
i
lived
for
others
and
ruined
my
lifeand
not
almost
but
completely
and
ive
been
at
peace
since
i
began
living
for
myself
alone
but
how
can
you
live
for
yourself
alone
asked
pierre
becoming
heated
what
about
your
son
your
sister
your
father
but
theyre
the
same
as
myself
theyre
not
others
said
prince
andrei
and
others
ones
neighbors
le
prochain
as
you
and
princess
marya
call
them
are
the
chief
source
of
error
and
evil
le
prochainthats
those
kievan
peasants
of
yours
to
whom
you
want
to
do
good
and
he
gave
pierre
a
mockingly
defiant
look
he
was
clearly
defying
pierre
youre
joking
said
pierre
growing
more
and
more
animated
what
error
and
evil
can
there
be
in
my
wish
though
fulfilled
very
little
and
poorly
my
wish
to
do
good
and
in
my
doing
at
least
something
what
evil
can
there
be
if
those
wretched
people
our
peasants
people
like
us
who
grow
up
and
die
with
no
other
notion
of
god
and
truth
than
an
icon
and
a
meaningless
prayer
are
taught
comforting
beliefs
about
the
future
life
retribution
reward
comfort
what
evil
and
error
are
there
if
people
are
dying
of
disease
without
any
help
when
its
so
easy
to
help
them
materially
and
i
give
them
a
doctor
and
a
hospital
and
a
shelter
for
the
aged
and
isnt
it
a
palpable
unquestionable
good
if
a
peasant
or
a
woman
with
a
baby
has
no
peace
day
or
night
and
i
give
them
rest
and
leisure
said
pierre
hurrying
and
lisping
and
ive
done
that
though
poorly
though
very
little
but
ive
done
something
to
that
end
and
you
not
only
wont
convince
me
that
what
ive
done
was
not
good
but
you
also
wont
convince
me
that
you
dont
think
so
yourself
and
above
all
pierre
went
on
this
i
know
and
know
for
certain
that
the
pleasure
of
doing
good
is
the
only
certain
happiness
in
life
yes
if
you
put
the
question
that
way
its
another
matter
said
prince
andrei
i
build
a
house
and
cultivate
a
garden
and
you
build
hospitals
both
can
serve
to
pass
the
time
but
whats
right
whats
goodthat
is
for
the
one
who
knows
all
to
judge
not
for
us
well
you
want
to
argue
he
added
so
lets
argue
they
left
the
table
and
sat
on
the
porch
which
took
the
place
of
a
balcony
well
lets
argue
then
said
prince
andrei
schools
you
say
he
went
on
raising
a
finger
instruction
and
so
onthat
is
you
want
to
lead
him
out
of
his
animal
condition
he
said
pointing
to
a
muzhik
who
took
off
his
hat
as
he
passed
by
and
give
him
moral
needs
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
possible
happiness
is
animal
happiness
and
you
want
to
deprive
him
of
it
i
envy
him
and
you
want
to
make
him
into
me
but
without
giving
him
my
intelligence
or
my
feelings
or
my
means
second
you
say
lighten
his
work
but
in
my
opinion
physical
labor
is
as
much
a
necessity
for
him
as
much
a
condition
of
his
existence
as
mental
labor
is
for
you
and
me
you
cannot
not
think
i
go
to
bed
past
two
oclock
i
have
thoughts
and
cant
sleep
i
toss
about
i
dont
fall
asleep
until
morning
because
im
thinking
and
cannot
not
think
as
he
cannot
not
plow
or
mowotherwise
hell
go
to
the
pothouse
or
fall
ill
just
as
i
could
not
stand
his
terrible
physical
labor
and
would
die
in
a
week
so
he
could
not
stand
my
physical
idleness
hed
grow
fat
and
die
thirdwhat
was
it
you
said
prince
andrei
raised
a
third
finger
ah
yes
hospitals
medicines
he
has
a
stroke
hes
dying
but
you
let
his
blood
you
cure
him
and
hell
go
around
crippled
for
another
ten
years
a
burden
on
everyone
its
far
more
simple
and
easy
for
him
to
die
others
will
be
born
there
are
lots
of
them
as
it
is
you
might
be
sorry
to
lose
an
extra
workerthats
how
i
look
at
himbut
no
you
want
to
cure
him
out
of
love
for
him
and
he
doesnt
need
that
besides
what
is
this
fantasy
that
medicine
has
ever
cured
anybodykilled
yes
he
said
frowning
spitefully
and
turning
away
from
pierre
prince
andrei
spoke
his
mind
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
it
was
evident
he
had
thought
about
it
more
than
once
and
he
spoke
eagerly
and
quickly
like
a
man
who
has
not
spoken
for
a
long
time
his
gaze
became
the
more
animated
the
more
hopeless
his
opinions
were
ah
thats
terrible
terrible
said
pierre
only
i
dont
understand
how
one
can
live
with
such
thoughts
such
moments
have
come
over
me
it
was
not
long
ago
in
moscow
and
on
the
road
but
then
i
go
so
much
to
seed
that
i
dont
live
i
find
everything
vile
above
all
myself
i
dont
eat
then
dont
washwell
how
is
it
with
you
why
dont
you
wash
its
not
clean
said
prince
andrei
on
the
contrary
one
must
try
to
make
ones
life
as
pleasant
as
possible
im
alive
and
its
not
my
fault
which
means
i
must
somehow
go
on
living
the
best
i
can
without
bothering
anybody
until
i
die
but
what
makes
you
live
with
such
thoughts
youll
sit
without
moving
without
undertaking
anything
life
wont
leave
one
alone
as
it
is
id
be
glad
to
do
nothing
but
then
on
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
deemed
me
worthy
of
being
elected
their
marshal
i
barely
got
out
of
it
they
couldnt
understand
that
i
dont
have
what
it
takes
dont
have
the
sort
of
goodnatured
and
bustling
banality
needed
for
it
then
theres
this
house
which
had
to
be
built
so
as
to
have
a
corner
where
i
could
be
at
peace
now
its
the
militia
why
arent
you
serving
in
the
army
after
austerlitz
prince
andrei
said
gloomily
no
i
humbly
thank
you
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
not
serve
in
the
active
russian
army
and
i
wont
if
bonaparte
was
camped
here
in
smolensk
threatening
bald
hills
even
then
i
wouldnt
serve
in
the
russian
army
well
as
i
was
saying
prince
andrei
went
on
calming
down
now
its
the
militia
my
father
is
commander
in
chief
of
the
third
district
and
my
only
means
of
avoiding
service
is
to
be
with
him
which
means
you
do
serve
i
do
he
paused
briefly
so
why
do
you
serve
heres
why
my
father
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
time
but
hes
getting
old
and
its
not
that
hes
cruel
but
he
has
all
too
active
a
character
hes
frightening
in
his
habit
of
unlimited
power
and
now
with
this
power
bestowed
on
him
by
the
sovereign
as
a
commander
in
chief
of
the
militia
if
i
had
been
two
hours
late
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
he
would
have
hanged
a
protocolist
in
yukhnovo
prince
andrei
said
with
a
smile
so
i
serve
because
no
one
except
for
me
has
any
influence
on
my
father
and
at
some
point
i
may
have
to
save
him
from
an
act
from
which
he
might
suffer
later
ah
well
so
you
see
yes
mais
ce
nest
pas
comme
vous
lentendez
prince
andrei
went
on
i
never
wished
nor
do
i
wish
now
any
good
to
that
scoundrel
of
a
protocolist
who
stole
some
boots
from
the
militiamen
id
even
be
very
pleased
to
see
him
hanged
but
i
pity
my
fatherthat
is
again
myself
prince
andrei
was
becoming
more
and
more
animated
his
eyes
shone
feverishly
all
the
while
he
was
trying
to
prove
to
pierre
that
there
never
was
any
wish
for
his
neighbors
good
in
his
action
well
here
you
want
to
emancipate
the
peasants
he
went
on
thats
very
good
but
not
for
you
i
suppose
youve
never
whipped
anyone
to
death
or
sent
them
to
siberia
and
still
less
for
the
peasants
if
theyre
beaten
whipped
and
sent
to
siberia
i
dont
think
that
makes
it
any
worse
for
them
in
siberia
hell
go
on
with
his
brutish
life
and
the
welts
on
his
body
will
heal
and
hell
be
as
happy
as
he
was
before
but
its
needed
for
those
people
who
are
morally
ruined
live
to
repent
it
suppress
this
repentance
and
turn
coarse
because
they
have
the
possibility
of
punishing
justly
and
unjustly
those
are
the
ones
i
pity
and
for
whose
sake
i
would
wish
for
the
emancipation
of
the
peasants
maybe
you
havent
seen
it
but
ive
seen
good
people
brought
up
in
this
tradition
of
unlimited
power
as
they
become
more
irritated
over
the
years
become
cruel
coarse
know
it
cant
help
themselves
and
become
more
and
more
unhappy
prince
andrei
said
this
with
such
enthusiasm
that
it
involuntarily
occurred
to
pierre
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
prince
andrei
by
his
father
he
made
no
reply
so
there
is
what
and
whom
to
be
sorry
forhuman
dignity
peace
of
conscience
purity
and
not
their
backs
and
heads
which
however
much
you
whip
them
and
shave
them
will
still
remain
the
same
backs
and
heads
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
ill
never
agree
with
you
said
pierre
xii
in
the
evening
prince
andrei
and
pierre
got
into
a
carriage
and
drove
to
bald
hills
prince
andrei
glancing
at
pierre
broke
the
silence
from
time
to
time
with
speeches
which
proved
that
he
was
in
a
good
state
of
mind
pointing
to
the
fields
he
told
him
about
his
improvements
in
management
pierre
was
gloomily
silent
answered
monosyllabically
and
seemed
to
be
immersed
in
his
own
thoughts
pierre
was
thinking
about
prince
andrei
that
he
was
unhappy
that
he
was
mistaken
that
he
did
not
know
the
true
light
that
pierre
had
come
to
his
aid
to
enlighten
him
and
raise
him
up
but
as
soon
as
pierre
thought
of
how
and
what
he
was
going
to
say
he
had
the
feeling
that
prince
andrei
would
discredit
his
entire
teaching
with
a
single
word
a
single
argument
and
he
was
afraid
to
begin
afraid
to
expose
his
favorite
sacred
thing
to
the
possibility
of
ridicule
no
why
do
you
think
pierre
suddenly
began
lowering
his
head
and
looking
like
a
butting
bull
why
do
you
think
that
way
you
shouldnt
think
that
way
about
what
prince
andrei
asked
in
surprise
about
life
about
mans
purpose
it
cant
be
i
thought
the
same
and
do
you
know
what
saved
me
masonry
no
dont
smile
masonry
is
not
a
religious
not
a
ritual
sect
as
i
also
thought
masonry
is
the
best
the
only
expression
of
the
best
the
eternal
sides
of
mankind
and
he
began
to
explain
masonry
to
prince
andrei
as
he
understood
it
he
said
that
masonry
is
the
teaching
of
christianity
freed
of
state
and
religious
fetters
the
teaching
of
equality
brotherhood
and
love
only
our
holy
brotherhood
has
real
meaning
in
life
all
the
rest
is
a
dream
said
pierre
understand
my
friend
that
outside
this
union
everything
is
filled
with
lies
and
falsehood
and
i
agree
with
you
that
an
intelligent
and
good
man
has
nothing
left
but
to
live
out
his
life
like
you
trying
only
not
to
bother
others
but
adopt
our
basic
convictions
join
our
brotherhood
give
yourself
to
us
let
yourself
be
guided
and
you
will
at
once
feel
yourself
as
i
did
a
this
huge
invisible
chain
the
beginning
of
which
is
hidden
in
heaven
said
pierre
prince
andrei
looking
straight
ahead
listened
silently
to
pierres
speech
a
few
times
he
asked
pierre
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
heard
because
of
the
noise
of
the
carriage
by
a
particular
gleam
that
lit
up
in
prince
andreis
eyes
and
by
his
silence
pierre
saw
that
his
words
were
not
in
vain
that
prince
andrei
would
not
interrupt
him
or
laugh
at
what
he
was
saying
they
approached
a
flooded
river
which
they
had
to
cross
by
ferry
while
the
carriage
and
horses
were
being
loaded
they
boarded
the
ferry
prince
andrei
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
rail
looked
silently
down
the
floodwaters
sparkling
in
the
setting
sun
well
what
do
you
think
about
that
asked
pierre
why
are
you
silent
what
do
i
think
ive
been
listening
to
you
that
is
all
so
said
prince
andrei
but
you
say
join
our
brotherhood
and
well
show
you
the
goal
of
life
and
the
purpose
of
man
and
the
laws
that
govern
the
world
but
who
are
wejust
people
how
do
you
know
everything
how
is
it
that
i
alone
do
not
see
what
you
see
you
see
the
kingdom
of
the
good
and
the
true
on
earth
and
i
dont
see
it
pierre
interrupted
him
do
you
believe
in
a
future
life
he
asked
a
future
life
prince
andrei
repeated
but
pierre
gave
him
no
time
to
reply
and
took
this
repetition
for
a
denial
the
more
so
as
he
knew
prince
andreis
former
atheistic
convictions
you
say
you
cant
see
the
kingdom
of
the
good
and
the
true
on
earth
i
didnt
see
it
either
and
it
cant
be
seen
if
you
look
at
our
life
as
the
end
of
everything
on
earth
i
mean
this
earth
pierre
pointed
to
the
fields
there
is
no
trutheverything
is
falsehood
and
evil
but
in
the
universe
in
the
whole
universe
there
is
the
kingdom
of
the
true
and
we
are
now
children
of
the
earth
but
eternallychildren
of
the
whole
universe
dont
i
feel
in
my
soul
that
i
make
up
a
that
huge
harmonious
whole
dont
i
feel
that
among
the
countless
number
of
beings
in
which
the
divinitythe
higher
powerwhatever
you
likeis
manifest
i
make
up
one
link
one
step
from
lower
beings
to
higher
if
i
see
see
clearly
this
ladder
that
leads
from
plant
to
man
then
why
should
i
suppose
that
this
ladder
the
lower
end
of
which
i
do
not
see
is
lost
in
the
plants
why
should
i
suppose
that
this
ladder
stops
with
me
and
does
not
lead
further
and
further
to
higher
beings
i
feel
not
only
that
i
cannot
disappear
as
nothing
disappears
in
the
world
but
that
i
will
always
be
and
have
always
been
i
feel
that
besides
me
above
me
spirits
live
and
that
in
this
world
there
is
truth
yes
thats
herders
teaching
said
prince
andrei
but
that
dear
heart
does
not
convince
me
life
and
death
are
what
convince
me
what
convinces
me
is
to
see
a
being
dear
to
you
who
is
bound
up
with
you
before
whom
you
were
guilty
and
hoped
to
vindicate
yourself
prince
andreis
voice
quavered
and
he
turned
away
and
suddenly
this
being
suffers
agonizes
and
ceases
to
bewhy
it
cannot
be
that
theres
no
answer
and
i
believe
there
is
onethat
is
what
convinces
that
is
what
has
convinced
me
said
prince
andrei
yes
ah
yes
said
pierre
and
isnt
that
the
same
as
what
im
saying
no
all
i
say
is
that
what
convinces
one
of
the
necessity
of
a
future
life
is
not
arguments
but
when
one
goes
through
life
hand
in
hand
with
a
person
and
suddenly
that
person
disappears
there
into
nowhere
and
you
yourself
stop
before
that
abyss
and
look
into
it
and
i
did
look
well
thats
just
it
you
know
theres
a
there
and
theres
a
someone
there
is
the
future
life
the
someone
isgod
prince
andrei
did
not
reply
the
carriage
and
horses
had
long
been
led
out
on
the
other
side
and
hitched
up
and
the
sun
had
already
half
disappeared
and
the
evening
frost
had
covered
the
pools
by
the
crossing
with
stars
but
pierre
and
andrei
to
the
astonishment
of
the
lackeys
coachmen
and
ferrymen
were
still
standing
on
the
ferry
and
talking
if
there
is
god
and
if
there
is
a
future
life
then
there
is
truth
there
is
virtue
and
mans
highest
happiness
consists
in
striving
to
attain
them
we
must
live
we
must
love
we
must
believe
said
pierre
that
we
do
not
live
only
today
on
this
scrap
of
earth
but
have
lived
and
will
live
eternally
there
in
the
all
he
pointed
to
the
sky
prince
andrei
stood
with
his
elbow
resting
on
the
rail
of
the
ferry
and
listening
to
pierre
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
red
gleam
of
the
sun
on
the
blue
floodwaters
pierre
fell
silent
it
was
completely
still
the
ferry
had
long
been
moored
and
only
the
waves
of
the
current
lapped
with
a
faint
sound
against
the
ferrys
bottom
it
seemed
to
prince
andrei
that
this
splash
of
waves
made
a
refrain
to
pierres
words
saying
its
true
believe
it
prince
andrei
sighed
and
with
a
luminous
childlike
tender
gaze
looked
into
the
flushed
rapturous
face
of
pierre
who
still
felt
timid
before
his
superior
friend
yes
if
only
it
were
so
he
said
anyhow
lets
go
and
get
in
prince
andrei
added
and
stepping
off
the
ferry
he
looked
at
the
sky
pierre
had
pointed
to
and
for
the
first
time
since
austerlitz
saw
that
high
eternal
sky
he
had
seen
as
he
lay
on
the
battlefield
and
something
long
asleep
something
that
was
best
in
him
suddenly
awakened
joyful
and
young
in
his
soul
this
feeling
disappeared
as
soon
as
prince
andrei
reentered
the
habitual
conditions
of
life
but
he
knew
that
this
feeling
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
develop
lived
in
him
the
meeting
with
pierre
marked
an
epoch
for
prince
andrei
from
which
began
what
while
outwardly
the
same
was
in
his
inner
world
a
new
life
xiii
it
was
already
dusk
when
prince
andrei
and
pierre
drove
up
to
the
main
entrance
of
the
house
at
bald
hills
as
they
were
driving
up
prince
andrei
smiling
drew
pierres
attention
to
the
bustling
that
was
going
on
by
the
back
porch
a
bent
old
woman
with
a
bundle
on
her
back
and
a
short
man
dressed
in
black
and
with
long
hair
seeing
the
carriage
drive
up
went
running
back
to
the
gate
two
women
ran
out
after
them
and
all
four
glancing
at
the
carriage
ran
fearfully
up
the
back
porch
those
are
mashas
people
of
god
said
prince
andrei
they
took
us
for
father
and
this
is
the
only
thing
in
which
she
doesnt
obey
him
he
orders
these
wanderers
driven
away
but
she
receives
them
but
what
are
these
people
of
god
asked
pierre
prince
andrei
had
no
time
to
answer
him
the
servants
came
out
to
meet
them
and
he
asked
them
where
the
old
prince
was
and
how
soon
they
expected
him
the
old
prince
was
still
in
town
and
he
was
expected
at
any
moment
prince
andrei
took
pierre
to
his
rooms
which
always
awaited
him
in
perfect
order
in
his
fathers
house
and
went
himself
to
the
nursery
lets
go
to
my
sister
said
prince
andrei
returning
to
pierre
i
havent
seen
her
yet
shes
hiding
now
and
sitting
with
her
people
of
god
it
will
serve
her
right
shell
get
embarrassed
but
youll
see
the
people
of
god
cest
curieux
ma
parole
questce
que
cest
que
people
of
god
asked
pierre
youll
see
princess
marya
indeed
became
embarrassed
and
covered
with
red
spots
when
they
came
to
her
in
her
cozy
room
with
icon
lamps
before
the
icons
a
young
boy
with
a
long
nose
and
long
hair
and
in
a
monks
cassock
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
beside
her
at
the
samovar
in
an
armchair
next
to
them
sat
a
thin
wrinkled
old
woman
with
a
meek
expression
on
her
childlike
face
andr233
pourquoi
ne
pas
mavoir
pr233venu
she
said
in
mild
reproach
standing
in
front
of
her
wanderers
like
a
hen
in
front
of
her
chicks
charm233e
de
vous
voir
je
suis
tr232s
contente
de
vous

she
said
to
pierre
as
he
was
kissing
her
hand
she
had
known
him
as
a
child
and
now
his
friendship
with
andrei
the
misfortune
with
his
wife
and
above
all
his
kind
simple
face
disposed
her
towards
him
she
looked
at
him
with
her
beautiful
luminous
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
saying
i
like
you
very
much
but
please
dont
laugh
at
my
people
having
exchanged
the
first
phrases
of
greeting
they
sat
down
ah
ivanushkas
here
too
said
prince
andrei
indicating
the
young
wanderer
with
his
smile
andr233
princess
marya
said
pleadingly
il
faut
que
vous
sachiez
que
cest
une
femme
andrei
said
to
pierre
andr233
au
nom
de

princess
marya
repeated
it
was
clear
that
prince
andreis
mocking
attitude
towards
the
wanderers
and
princess
maryas
useless
intercession
for
them
were
habitual
wellestablished
relations
between
them
mais

said
pierre
studying
the
face
of
ivanushka
curiously
and
gravely
through
his
spectacles
for
which
princess
marya
was
especially
grateful
to
him
realizing
that
they
were
talking
about
him
ivanushka
looked
around
at
them
all
with
cunning
eyes
princess
maryas
embarrassment
for
her
people
was
totally
unnecessary
they
were
not
in
the
least
intimidated
the
little
old
woman
her
eyes
lowered
and
casting
sidelong
glances
at
the
newcomers
turned
her
teacup
bottom
up
on
the
saucer
and
placing
the
nibbled
piece
of
sugar
beside
it
sat
calm
and
motionless
in
her
armchair
waiting
to
be
offered
more
tea
ivanushka
sipping
from
the
saucer
looked
at
the
young
men
from
under
his
brows
with
his
sly
feminine
eyes
where
have
you
been
to
kiev
prince
andrei
asked
the
old
woman

pierre

listened
attentively

the
wanderer
woman

said
in
horror
turning
to
princess

he
went
blind
and
he

a
dream
that

mother
of
god
of
the
caves
comes
to
him
and
says

star

into
the
icon
so
he
got
his
sight
back
its
a
sin
to
speak
as

she
addressed
pierre
didactically
how
did
the
star

into
the
icon

pierre

the
mother
of
god
has
been
promoted
to

prince

smiling
pelageyushka
suddenly
turned
pale
and
clasped
her
hands
good

her
pallor

herself

good

she
turned
to
princess
marya
she
got
up
and
all
but
in
tears
began
packing
her
bag
she
was
clearly
frightened
and
sorry
for
the
one
who
had
said
it
and
ashamed
that
she
had
received
benefactions
in
a
house
where
such
things
could
be
said
and
sorry
that
she
now
had
to
be
deprived
of
those
benefactions
well
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
said
princess
marya
why
did
you
come
to
me
no
i
was
joking
pelageyushka
said
pierre
princesse
ma
parole
je
nai
pas
voulu
loffenser
i
just
said
it
never
mind
i
meant
it
as
a
joke
he
said
smiling
timidly
and
wishing
to
smooth
over
his
guilt
pelageyushka
paused
mistrustfully
but
pierres
face
showed
such
sincere
regret
and
prince
andrei
looked
so
meekly
and
gravely
now
at
pelageyushka
now
at
pierre
that
she
gradually
calmed
down
xiv
the
wanderer
woman
calmed
down
and
urged
to
go
on
spent
a
long
time
telling
about
father
amphilokhy
whose
life
was
so
holy
that
his
dear
hand
smelled
of
incense
and
about
how
during
her
last
pilgrimage
to
kiev
some
monks
she
knew
gave
her
the
keys
to
the
caves
and
how
she
took
some
rusks
and
spent
two
days
in
the
caves
with
the
saints
id
pray
to
one
recite
a
little
and
go
to
another
id
doze
go
again
and
kiss
the
relics
and
it
was
so
quiet
dearie
so
blissful
that
i
didnt
even
feel
like
going
out
into
gods
world
pierre
listened
to
her
attentively
and
gravely
prince
andrei
left
the
room
and
after
him
princess
marya
left
the
people
of
god
to
finish
their
tea
and
took
pierre
to
the
drawing
room
youre
very
kind
she
said
to
him
ah
really
i
didnt
mean
to
offend
her
i
understand
those
feelings
and
value
them
highly
princess
marya
silently
looked
at
him
and
smiled
tenderly
ive
known
you
a
long
time
and
love
you
like
a
brother
she
said
how
do
you
find
andrei
she
asked
hastily
not
giving
him
time
to
say
anything
to
her
affectionate
words
he
worries
me
very
much
this
winter
his
health
has
improved
but
last
spring
his
wound
reopened
and
the
doctor
said
he
should
go
abroad
for
treatment
and
morally
i
fear
very
much
for
him
hes
not
of
the
same
character
as
us
women
who
suffer
and
weep
out
our
grief
he
carries
it
inside
him
today
hes
merry
and
lively
but
its
your
arrival
that
has
had
that
effect
on
him
hes
rarely
that
way
if
only
you
could
persuade
him
to
go
abroad
he
needs
activity
and
this
regular
quiet
life
is
ruining
him
others
dont
notice
but
i
see
it
towards
ten
oclock
the
manservants
rushed
out
to
the
porch
hearing
the
bells
of
the
old
princes
carriage
as
it
drove
up
prince
andrei
and
pierre
also
went
out
to
the
porch
whos
that
the
old
prince
asked
getting
out
of
the
carriage
and
seeing
pierre
ah
very
glad
kiss
me
he
said
on
learning
who
the
unknown
young
man
was
the
old
prince
was
in
good
spirits
and
treated
pierre
affectionately
before
supper
prince
andrei
returning
to
his
fathers
study
found
the
old
prince
in
hot
dispute
with
pierre
pierre
insisted
that
a
time
would
come
when
there
would
be
no
more
war
the
old
prince
mockingly
but
without
getting
angry
argued
against
him
drain
the
blood
from
their
veins
put
in
water
then
therell
be
no
more
war
nonsense
old
womens
nonsense
he
said
but
even
so
he
patted
pierre
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
and
went
over
to
the
desk
where
prince
andrei
evidently
unwilling
to
enter
the
conversation
was
looking
through
the
papers
that
the
old
prince
had
brought
from
town
the
old
prince
went
over
to
him
and
began
talking
about
business
the
marshal
count
rostov
failed
to
produce
half
the
men
he
came
to
town
and
decided
to
invite
me
to
dinner
i
gave
him
a
real
dinnerand
look
at
this
onewell
my
boy
prince
nikolai
andreich
said
to
his
son
slapping
pierre
on
the
shoulder

friends

fine
fellow
ive
come
to
love
him
he
fires
me
up
another
man

cleverly
and
you

want
to
listen
to
him
but
he
talks
nonsense

he
fires
me
up
old
as
i
am
well
go
go
he
said
maybe
ill
come
and
sit
with
you
at
supper
and
argue
again
love
my
foolish
princess
marya
he
called
to
pierre
from
the
door
only
now
during
his
visit
to
bald
hills
did
pierre
appreciate
all
the
strength
and
charm
of
his
friendship
with
prince
andrei
this
charm
expressed
itself
not
so
much
in
his
relations
with
him
as
in
his
relations
with
the
whole
family
and
household
with
the
severe
old
prince
and
the
meek
and
timid
princes
marya
pierre
felt
at
once
like
an
old
friend
though
he
barely
knew
them
they
all
loved
him
already
not
only
did
princess
marya
won
over
by
his
meek
attitude
towards
the
wanderers
give
him
her
most
luminous
looks
but
the
little
oneyearold
prince
nikolai
as
his
grandfather
called
him
smiled
at
pierre
and
went
to
his
arms
and
mikhail
ivanych
and
mlle
bourienne
looked
at
him
with
joyful
smiles
when
he
talked
with
the
old
prince
the
old
prince
came
out
for
supper
this
was
obviously
for
pierres
sake
he
was
extremely
affectionate
with
him
on
both
days
of
his
stay
at
bald
hills
and
told
him
to
come
to
visit
when
pierre
left
and
all
the
members
of
the
family
came
together
they
began
to
discuss
him
as
always
happens
after
the
departure
of
a
new
person
and
as
rarely
happens
they
all
said
only
good
things
about
him
xv
returning
from
leave
this
time
rostov
felt
and
realized
for
the
first
time
how
strong
his
bond
was
with
denisov
and
the
whole
regiment
as
rostov
approached
the
regiment
he
experienced
a
feeling
similar
to
what
he
had
experienced
on
approaching
his
house
on
povarskaya
when
he
saw
the
first
hussar
in
the
unbuttoned
uniform
of
his
regiment
when
he
recognized
the
redhaired
dementyev
saw
the
redcoated
horses
at
the
tethering
rail
when
lavrushka
shouted
joyfully
to
his
master
the
counts
hereand
the
disheveled
denisov
who
had
been
asleep
in
bed
came
running
out
of
the
dugout
embraced
him
and
the
officers
gathered
around
him
rostov
experienced
the
same
feeling
as
when
his
mother
father
and
sisters
had
embraced
him
and
the
tears
of
joy
that
welled
up
in
his
throat
prevented
him
from
speaking
the
regiment
was
also
a
home
and
a
home
as
unchangingly
dear
and
precious
as
his
parental
home
when
he
had
reported
to
the
regimental
commander
had
obtained
an
assignment
to
his
former
squadron
had
been
on
duty
and
gone
foraging
had
entered
into
all
the
little
concerns
of
the
regiment
and
had
felt
himself
deprived
of
freedom
and
bound
within
one
narrow
unchanging
frame
rostov
experienced
the
same
peace
the
same
support
and
the
same
awareness
that
here
he
was
at
home
where
he
belonged
as
he
felt
under
the
parental
roof
there
was
not
all
that
disorder
of
the
free
world
in
which
he
found
no
place
for
himself
and
made
wrong
choices
there
was
no
sonya
with
whom
he
had
or
did
not
have
to
talk
things
over
there
was
no
possibility
of
going
or
not
going
here
or
there
there
were
not
those
twentyfour
hours
in
a
day
which
could
be
spent
in
so
many
different
ways
there
was
no
numberless
multitude
of
people
of
whom
no
one
was
close
no
one
was
distant
there
were
none
of
those
unclear
and
undefined
money
relations
with
his
father
there
was
no
recollection
of
that
terrible
loss
to
dolokhov
here
in
the
regiment
everything
was
clear
and
simple
the
whole
world
was
divided
into
two
unequal
parts
one
was
our
pavlogradsky
regiment
the
otherall
the
rest
and
with
this
rest
he
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
regiment
everything
was
known
who
was
a
lieutenant
who
a
captain
who
was
a
good
and
who
a
bad
man
andabove
allwho
was
a
comrade
the
sutler
gives
you
credit
your
salary
comes
three
times
a
year
there
is
nothing
to
think
up
or
choose
between
only
do
not
do
anything
that
is
considered
bad
in
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
when
you
are
sent
out
do
what
is
clearly
and
distinctly
defined
and
orderedand
all
will
be
well
having
entered
once
more
into
these
definite
conditions
of
regimental
life
rostov
experienced
a
joy
and
peace
similar
to
what
a
weary
man
feels
when
he
lies
down
to
rest
this
regimental
life
was
the
more
pleasurable
for
rostov
during
this
campaign
in
that
after
losing
to
dolokhov
an
act
for
which
despite
all
his
familys
reassurances
he
could
not
forgive
himself
he
had
resolved
to
serve
not
as
before
but
in
order
to
smooth
over
his
guilt
to
serve
well
and
be
a
perfectly
excellent
comrade
and
officer
that
is
a
fine
human
beingwhich
seemed
so
difficult
in
the
world
but
so
possible
in
the
regiment
since
the
time
of
his
gambling
loss
rostov
had
resolved
to
pay
back
the
debt
to
his
parents
within
five
years
they
used
to
send
him
ten
thousand
a
year
but
now
he
resolved
to
take
only
two
and
leave
the
rest
to
his
parents
in
repayment
of
his
debt
our
army
after
repeated
retreats
advances
and
battles
around
pultusk
and
preussischeylau
was
concentrated
near
bartenstein
it
was
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
sovereign
and
the
start
of
a
new
campaign
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
belonging
to
that
the
army
that
had
been
in
the
1805
campaign
had
been
replenishing
its
ranks
in
russia
and
was
late
for
the
first
actions
of
the
campaign
it
had
not
been
at
pultusk
nor
at
preussischeylau
and
joining
the
active
army
in
the
second
half
of
the
campaign
was
included
in
platovs
detachment
platovs
detachment
acted
independently
of
the
army
several
times
parts
of
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
participated
in
exchanges
of
fire
with
the
enemy
took
prisoners
and
once
even
captured
the
carriages
of
marshal
oudinot
in
the
month
of
april
the
regiment
camped
for
several
weeks
near
a
totally
devastated
empty
german
village
not
budging
from
the
spot
there
was
a
thaw
mud
cold
the
ice
on
the
river
broke
up
the
roads
became
impassable
for
several
days
provisions
had
not
been
issued
either
to
the
horses
or
to
the
men
since
transport
became
impossible
men
scattered
over
the
abandoned
desolate
villages
looking
for
potatoes
but
found
little
even
of
them
everything
had
been
eaten
and
the
local
people
had
all
fled
those
who
had
stayed
were
worse
than
destitute
there
was
nothing
to
take
from
them
and
the
soldiers
little
given
to
pity
often
even
gave
them
the
last
food
they
had
instead
of
taking
from
them
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
lost
only
two
men
wounded
in
action
but
it
lost
nearly
half
of
its
men
to
famine
and
disease
in
the
hospitals
death
was
such
a
certainty
that
soldiers
sick
with
fever
and
bloated
from
bad
food
preferred
to
go
on
serving
forcing
themselves
to
drag
their
feet
to
the
front
rather
than
go
to
the
hospital
with
the
coming
of
spring
the
soldiers
began
to
find
sprouting
from
the
ground
a
plant
resembling
asparagus
which
for
some
reason
they
called
mashkas
sweet
root
and
they
scattered
over
the
meadows
and
fields
hunting
for
this
mashkas
sweet
root
which
was
very
bitter
digging
it
up
with
their
sabers
and
eating
it
in
spite
of
orders
not
to
eat
this
noxious
plant
in
spring
a
new
disease
broke
out
among
the
soldiersa
swelling
of
the
hands
feet
and
face
the
cause
of
which
the
medics
took
to
be
the
consuming
of
this
root
but
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
the
pavlogradsky
soldiers
of
denisovs
squadron
mostly
ate
mashkas
sweet
root
because
for
two
weeks
already
the
last
supply
of
biscuits
had
been
stretched
each
man
receiving
only
half
a
pound
per
day
and
the
potatoes
of
the
last
shipment
had
frozen
or
sprouted
it
was
also
the
second
week
that
the
horses
had
been
eating
straw
from
the
roofs
of
houses
they
were
hideously
skinny
and
still
covered
with
their
winter
coat
which
was
matted
in
clumps
despite
such
destitution
the
soldiers
and
officers
lived
just
as
always
now
too
though
with
pale
and
swollen
faces
and
in
tattered
uniforms
the
hussars
lined
up
for
roll
call
did
the
cleaning
groomed
the
horses
polished
their
arms
pulled
straw
from
the
roofs
to
feed
the
horses
and
sat
down
to
eat
around
the
cauldrons
going
away
hungry
joking
about
their
vile
food
and
their
hunger
just
as
always
in
their
time
off
from
service
the
soldiers
made
bonfires
steamed
themselves
naked
by
the
flames
smoked
sorted
and
baked
the
sprouted
fusty
potatoes
and
told
or
listened
to
stories
about
potemkins
or
suvorovs
campaigns
or
tales
about
alyosha
the
rogue
and
the
priests
farmhand
mikolka
the
officers
just
as
usual
lived
two
or
three
together
in
gaping
halfravaged
houses
the
senior
officers
busied
themselves
with
obtaining
straw
and
potatoes
and
the
means
of
nourishing
the
men
in
general
the
lower
ranks
were
taken
up
as
always
some
with
cards
there
was
plenty
of
money
though
no
provisions
some
with
harmless
games
like
horseshoes
and
ninepins
there
was
little
talk
about
the
general
course
of
the
war
partly
because
nothing
positive
was
known
partly
because
it
was
vaguely
felt
that
the
general
business
of
the
war
was
going
badly
rostov
lived
with
denisov
as
before
and
their
bond
of
friendship
had
become
still
stronger
since
their
time
on
leave
denisov
never
spoke
about
rostovs
family
but
from
the
tender
friendship
which
the
commander
showed
his
officer
rostov
felt
that
the
elder
hussars
unlucky
love
for
natasha
played
a
the
strengthening
of
this
friendship
denisov
clearly
tried
to
expose
rostov
to
danger
as
rarely
as
possible
protected
him
and
met
him
with
particular
joy
when
he
returned
from
action
safe
and
sound
during
one
of
his
missions
in
an
abandoned
ravaged
village
where
he
had
gone
for
provisions
rostov
found
a
family
made
up
of
an
old
pole
his
daughter
and
a
nursing
baby
they
were
poorly
clothed
hungry
and
could
not
leave
having
no
means
of
moving
anywhere
rostov
brought
them
to
the
camp
placed
them
in
his
quarters
and
kept
them
for
several
weeks
while
the
old
man
was
recovering
one
of
rostovs
comrades
got
to
talking
about
women
and
began
to
tease
rostov
saying
he
was
the
cleverest
of
them
all
and
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
he
introduced
his
comrades
to
the
pretty
polish
woman
he
had
saved
rostov
took
the
joke
as
an
insult
flared
up
and
said
such
unpleasant
things
to
the
officer
that
denisov
barely
managed
to
keep
them
from
a
duel
when
the
officer
left
and
denisov
who
did
not
know
himself
what
rostovs
relations
with
the
polish
woman
were
began
to
rebuke
him
for
being
hottempered
rostov
said
to
him
think
what
you
willshes
like
a
sister
to
me
and
i
cant
describe
to
you
how
hurt
i
feltbecausewell
since
i
denisov
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
quickly
began
pacing
the
room
without
looking
at
rostov
something
he
did
in
moments
of
inner
turmoil
its
your
crazy
rostov
breed
he
said
and
rostov
noticed
tears
in
denisovs
eyes
xvi
in
the
month
of
april
the
troops
were
enlivened
by
news
that
the
sovereign
was
coming
to
the
army
rostov
did
not
manage
to
get
to
the
review
that
the
sovereign
held
in
bartenstein
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
was
stationed
at
outposts
far
forward
of
bartenstein
they
were
on
bivouac
denisov
and
rostov
lived
in
a
dugout
covered
with
branches
and
turf
that
the
soldiers
had
made
for
them
the
dugout
was
made
in
the
following
way
which
had
then
come
into
fashion
a
trench
was
dug
four
feet
wide
five
feet
deep
and
nine
feet
long
at
one
end
of
the
dugout
steps
were
made
and
this
was
the
way
down
the
entrance
the
trench
itself
was
the
room
in
which
the
lucky
ones
such
as
the
squadron
commander
had
a
board
lying
on
four
posts
at
the
far
endthis
was
a
table
along
both
sides
of
the
trench
earth
was
removed
to
a
width
of
two
and
a
half
feet
and
this
made
two
beds
or
couches
the
roof
was
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
one
could
stand
up
in
the
middle
and
one
could
even
sit
up
on
the
beds
if
one
moved
closer
to
the
table
denisov
who
lived
in
luxury
because
the
soldiers
of
his
squadron
loved
him
also
had
a
board
in
the
pediment
of
the
roof
with
a
piece
of
broken
but
mended
glass
set
into
it
when
it
was
very
cold
hot
coals
from
the
soldiers
bonfires
were
brought
to
the
steps
the
anteroom
as
denisov
called
this
the
shed
on
a
bent
piece
of
sheet
iron
and
it
became
so
warm
that
the
officers
of
whom
there
were
always
many
with
rostov
and
denisov
sat
in
nothing
but
their
shirts
in
the
month
of
april
rostov
was
on
duty
past
seven
in
the
morning
coming
home
after
a
sleepless
night
he
ordered
hot
coals
brought
changed
his
rainsoaked
underclothes
said
his
prayers
drank
some
tea
got
warm
tidied
things
up
in
his
corner
and
on
the
table
and
with
a
windburned
face
in
nothing
but
his
shirt
lay
on
his
back
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
thought
pleasantly
about
the
promotion
he
was
supposed
to
receive
one
of
those
days
for
his
last
reconnoitering
and
waited
for
denisov
who
had
stepped
out
somewhere
rostov
wanted
to
talk
with
him
from
behind
the
hut
came
the
rolling
shout
of
denisov
obviously
in
a
fit
of
temper
rostov
moved
to
the
window
to
see
whom
he
was
dealing
with
and
saw
sergeant
major
topcheenko
i
ordered
you
not
to
let
them
eat
that
root
mashkas
or
whatever
shouted
denisov
i
saw
it
myself
lazarchuk
was
bringing
some
from
the
fields
i
ordered
them
your
honor
they
dont
obey
said
the
sergeant
major
rostov
lay
down
again
on
his
bed
and
thought
with
pleasure
let
him
fuss
and
bustle
now
ive
done
my
job
and
im
lying
downthats
splendid
through
the
wall
he
heard
that
besides
the
sergeant
major
lavrushka
denisovs
pert
and
roguish
lackey
was
also
talking
lavrushka
was
telling
something
about
some
sort
of
wagons
biscuits
and
oxen
he
had
seen
when
he
went
for
provisions
from
behind
the
shed
came
the
shouting
of
denisov
again
moving
away
and
the
words
saddle
upsecond
section
where
are
they
going
rostov
wondered
five
minutes
later
denisov
came
into
the
shed
climbed
onto
the
bed
in
his
muddy
boots
angrily
smoked
his
pipe
scattered
all
his
belongings
around
strapped
on
his
riding
whip
and
saber
and
started
out
of
the
dugout
to
rostovs
question
where
tohe
answered
angrily
and
vaguely
that
there
was
business
to
be
done
let
god
and
the
reat
sovereign
judge
me
for
it
denisov
said
as
he
went
out
and
rostov
heard
the
hoofs
of
several
horses
splash
through
the
mud
behind
the
shed
rostov
did
not
even
bother
to
find
out
where
denisov
had
gone
having
warmed
up
in
his
corner
he
fell
asleep
and
emerged
from
the
hut
only
towards
evening
denisov
had
not
come
back
yet
the
evening
turned
clear
by
the
next
dugout
two
officers
and
a
junker
were
pitching
horseshoes
laughing
as
the
horseshoes
stuck
in
the
loose
muddy
soil
rostov
joined
them
in
the
middle
of
the
game
the
officers
saw
some
wagons
driving
up
to
them
they
were
followed
by
about
fifteen
hussars
on
skinny
horses
the
wagons
with
their
hussar
convoy
drove
up
to
the
tethering
posts
and
a
crowd
of
hussars
surrounded
them
well
so
denisov
got
all
upset
said
rostov
and
here
come
the
provisions
right
you
are
said
the
officers
the
soldiers
must
be
overjoyed
denisov
rode
a
little
behind
the
hussars
accompanied
by
two
infantry
officers
with
whom
he
was
talking
about
something
rostov
walked
towards
them
i
warn
you
captain
said
one
of
the
officers
thin
small
and
clearly
very
angry
i
said
i
wont
give
them
up
replied
denisov
youll
answer
for
this
captain
its
violenceto
seize
your
own
armys
transport
our
men
havent
eaten
for
two
days
and
mine
havent
eaten
for
two
weeks
replied
denisov
its
highway
robbery
my
dear
sir
youll
answer
for
it
the
infantry
officer
repeated
raising
his
voice
what
are
you
bothering
me
for
eh
shouted
denisov
suddenly
flaring
up
im
the
one
wholl
answer
for
it
not
you
so
stop
buzzing
around
here
while
youre
still
in
one
piece
march
he
shouted
at
the
officers
all
right
then
shouted
the
little
officer
not
intimidated
and
not
going
away
this
is
highway
robbery
so
ill
march
off
to
the
devil
quick
step
while
youre
still
in
one
piece
and
denisov
turned
his
horse
towards
the
officer
all
right
all
right
the
officer
said
menacingly
and
turning
his
horse
he
rode
off
at
a
trot
bouncing
in
the
saddle
a
dog
on
a
fence
a
real
live
dog
on
a
fence
denisov
said
behind
him
a
cavalrymans
highest
mockery
of
an
infantryman
on
horseback
and
riding
up
to
rostov
he
burst
out
laughing
i
took
it
from
the
infantry
took
the
whole
transport
by
force
he
said
what
should
people
drop
dead
of
hunger
the
wagons
that
were
driven
up
to
the
hussars
had
been
intended
for
an
infantry
regiment
but
learning
from
lavrushka
that
the
transport
was
unescorted
denisov
and
his
hussars
took
it
by
force
the
soldiers
were
given
biscuits
in
plenty
and
they
even
shared
them
with
other
squadrons
the
next
day
the
regimental
commander
summoned
denisov
and
told
him
covering
his
eyes
with
his
spread
fingers
i
look
at
it
this
way
i
know
nothing
and
will
not
start
proceedings
but
i
advise
you
to
go
to
the
staff
and
settle
matters
there
in
the
provisions
department
and
if
possible
to
sign
a
receipt
that
you
received
suchandsuch
provisions
in
the
contrary
casesince
the
request
was
put
in
by
the
infantry
regimentproceedings
could
be
started
and
might
end
badly
denisov
rode
to
the
staff
straight
from
the
regimental
commander
with
a
sincere
wish
to
follow
his
advice
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
his
dugout
in
such
a
state
as
rostov
had
never
yet
seen
him
in
denisov
could
not
speak
and
was
gasping
for
breath
when
rostov
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
only
uttered
incomprehensible
oaths
and
threats
in
a
hoarse
and
weak
voice
alarmed
by
denisovs
state
rostov
suggested
he
should
undress
drink
some
water
and
send
for
the
doctor
me
tried
for
robberyach
give
me
more
waterlet
them
try
me
but
ill
beat
the
scoundrels
ill
always
beat
them
and
ill
tell
the
sovereign
give
me
ice
he
kept
murmuring
the
regimental
doctor
came
and
said
it
was
necessary
to
bleed
him
a
deep
dish
of
dark
blood
came
from
denisovs
shaggy
arm
and
only
then
was
he
able
to
tell
what
had
happened
to
him
i
arrive
denisov
told
them
well

denisov
shouted
pounding
the
table
with
the
fist
of
his
justbled
arm
so
hard
that
the
table
almost
fell
and
the
glasses
on
it
jumped
telyanin
so
its

and
i
started
pummeling
him
anyhow
it
was
good
fun
i
can
tell
you
denisov
cried
baring
his
white
teeth
gleefully
and
spitefully
under
his
black
mustache
id
have
killed
him
if
they
hadnt
pulled
us
apart
but
what
are
you
shouting
for
calm
down
said
rostov
here
youre
bleeding
again
wait
your
bandage
should
be
changed
denisovs
bandage
was
changed
and
he
was
put
to
bed
the
next
day
he
woke
up
cheerful
and
calm
but
at
noon
the
regimental
adjutant
came
with
a
grave
and
mournful
face
to
denisov
and
rostovs
dugout
and
regretfully
showed
them
an
official
paper
to
major
denisov
from
the
regimental
commander
in
which
questions
were
raised
about
yesterdays
occurrence
the
adjutant
informed
them
that
the
affair
was
bound
to
take
a
rather
bad
turn
that
a
courtmartial
had
been
appointed
and
that
considering
the
present
strictness
about
marauding
and
insubordination
among
the
troops
in
the
best
case
the
affair
might
end
in
demotion
the
affair
was
presented
by
the
offended
side
in
such
guise
that
after
seizing
the
transport
major
denisov
uninvited
in
a
drunken
state
appeared
at
the
quartermaster
generals
called
him
a
thief
threatened
him
with
a
beating
and
when
removed
rushed
into
the
office
attacked
two
clerks
and
dislocated
the
arm
of
one
to
rostovs
renewed
questions
denisov
laughing
said
that
it
seemed
somebody
else
had
turned
up
there
but
it
was
all
nonsense
trifles
that
he
did
not
even
dream
of
being
afraid
of
any
courts
and
that
if
those
scoundrels
dared
to
provoke
him
he
would
give
them
an
answer
they
would
remember
denisov
spoke
disdainfully
of
the
whole
affair
but
rostov
knew
him
too
well
not
to
notice
that
in
his
soul
concealing
it
from
others
he
was
afraid
of
the
trial
and
suffered
over
the
affair
which
was
obviously
going
to
have
bad
consequences
every
day
papers
of
inquiry
came
summonses
from
the
court
and
on
the
first
of
may
denisov
was
ordered
to
turn
over
command
of
the
squadron
to
the
next
in
seniority
and
report
to
the
division
staff
for
explanations
of
the
case
of
violence
in
the
provisions
commission
on
the
eve
of
that
day
platov
made
a
reconnaissance
of
the
enemy
with
two
cossack
regiments
and
two
hussar
squadrons
denisov
as
always
rode
out
in
front
of
the
line
showing
off
his
courage
a
bullet
fired
by
a
french
rifleman
hit
him
in
the
fleshy
upper
the
leg
perhaps
at
another
time
denisov
would
not
have
left
the
regiment
with
such
a
slight
wound
but
now
he
took
advantage
of
this
chance
excused
himself
from
appearing
at
the
division
and
went
to
the
hospital
xvii
in
the
month
of
june
the
battle
of
friedland
took
place
in
which
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
did
not
participate
and
after
it
a
truce
was
declared
rostov
who
painfully
felt
his
friends
absence
having
no
news
of
him
since
the
time
of
his
departure
and
worried
about
the
course
of
his
case
and
his
wound
took
advantage
of
the
truce
and
obtained
permission
to
visit
denisov
in
the
hospital
the
hospital
was
in
a
little
prussian
village
twice
ravaged
by
russian
and
french
troops
precisely
because
it
was
summer
when
it
was
so
pleasant
in
the
fields
this
little
village
with
its
broken
roofs
and
fences
and
its
littered
streets
with
ragged
inhabitants
and
drunken
or
sick
soldiers
wandering
about
in
it
presented
an
especially
dismal
sight
the
hospital
was
housed
in
a
stone
buidling
with
a
portion
of
its
windows
and
window
frames
broken
which
stood
in
a
yard
with
the
remains
of
a
dismantled
fence
several
soldiers
bandaged
pale
and
swollen
were
walking
about
or
sitting
in
the
yard
in
the
sun
as
soon
as
rostov
went
through
the
door
of
the
house
he
was
enveloped
by
the
stench
of
rotting
flesh
and
hospital
on
the
stairs
he
met
a
russian
military
doctor
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
the
doctor
was
followed
by
a
russian
assistant
i
cant
tear
myself
in
two
said
the
doctor
come
to
makar
alexeevichs

the
evening

the
assistant
asked
him

doctor
saw
rostov
coming
up

stairs

the
doctor

the
doctor
said
with
visible
pleasure
prussian
doctors

invited
but
our
allies

find
it
to
their
liking
rostov
explained
to
him
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
hussar
major
denisov
who
was
a
patient
there
i

he
turned
to
the
assistant
the
assistant
looked
exhausted
he
was
clearly
waiting
with
vexation
for
the
garrulous
doctor
to
leave
major
denisov
rostov
repeated
he
was
wounded
at
moliten
seems

eh
makeev
the
doctor
asked
the
assistant
indifferently
the
assistant
however

not
confirm
the
doctors
words

a
tall
man
with
reddish
hair
asked
the
doctor
rostov
described
denisovs
appearance

he
added
turning
to
rostov
eh

my
lad
said
the
doctor
or
you
may
wind
up
staying
yourself
but
rostov
took
leave
of
the
doctor
and
asked
the
assistant
to
accompany
him
just
dont
go
blaming
me
the
doctor
shouted
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
rostov
and
the
assistant
went
into
the
corridor
the
hospital
stench
in
this
dark
corridor
was
so
strong
that
rostov
held
his
hand
to
his
nose
and
had
to
stop
and
gather
his
strength
to
go
further
a
door
to
the
right
opened
and
a
thin
yellow
man
on
crutches
stuck
himself
out
barefoot
and
in
nothing
but
his
underwear
leaning
against
the
door
frame
he
looked
at
the
passing
men
with
glittering
envious
eyes
glancing
through
the
door
rostov
saw
sick
and
wounded
men
lying
there
on
the
floor
on
straw
and
overcoats
whats
this
he
asked
the
soldiers
wards
the
assistant
replied
nothing
to
be
done
he
added
as
if
apologizing
may
i
go
in
and
look
asked
rostov
whats
there
to
look
at
said
the
assistant
but
precisely
because
the
assistant
obviously
did
not
want
to
let
him
go
in
rostov
entered
the
soldiers
wards
here
the
stench
which
he
had
managed
to
get
used
to
in
the
corridor
was
still
stronger
the
stench
here
was
slightly
different
it
was
sharper
and
one
could
sense
that
it
was
coming
precisely
from
here
in
the
long
room
brightly
lit
by
the
sun
through
the
large
windows
sick
and
wounded
men
lay
in
two
rows
their
heads
towards
the
walls
leaving
a
passage
in
the
middle
most
of
them
were
oblivious
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
visitors
those
who
were
conscious
all
sat
up
or
raised
their
thin
yellow
faces
and
fastened
their
eyes
on
rostov
with
the
same
expression
of
hope
for
help
of
reproach
and
envy
of
another
mans
health
rostov
went
to
the
middle
of
the
room
glanced
into
the
next
two
rooms
through
the
open
doors
and
on
both
sides
saw
the
same
thing
he
stopped
silently
looking
around
him
he
had
never
expected
to
see
what
he
saw
right
in
front
of
him
almost
across
the
middle
passage
on
the
bare
floor
lay
a
sick
man
probably
a
cossack
because
his
hair
was
cut
square
this
cossack
lay
on
his
back
his
huge
arms
and
legs
spread
his
face
was
purplered
his
eyes
were
completely
rolled
up
so
that
only
the
whites
showed
and
the
veins
on
his
bare
feet
and
arms
also
red
were
taut
as
ropes
he
struck
his
head
on
the
floor
and
said
something
hoarsely
and
started
repeating
a
word
rostov
listened
to
what
he
said
and
figured
out
the
word
he
was
repeating
this
word
was
drink
drink
drink
rostov
looked
around
hoping
to
find
someone
who
could
put
this
patient
in
his
place
and
give
him
some
water
who
looks
after
the
patients
here
he
asked
the
assistant
just
then
a
commissariat
soldier
a
hospital
attendant
came
out
of
the
next
room
and
stamping
his
feet
snapped
to
attention
in
front
of
rostov
good
day
to
you
your
honor
sir
the
soldier
shouted
out
rolling
his
eyes
at
rostov
and
obviously
taking
him
for
a
hospital
superior
take
him
away
give
him
water
rostov
said
pointing
to
the
cossack
yes
sir
your
honor
the
soldier
said
with
pleasure
rolling
his
eyes
and
drawing
himself
up
still
more
zealously
but
not
budging
from
his
place
no
theres
nothing
to
be
done
here
thought
rostov
lowering
his
eyes
and
he
was
already
about
to
leave
but
he
felt
a
meaningful
gaze
directed
at
him
from
the
right
and
turned
to
look
almost
in
the
corner
on
an
overcoat
sat
an
old
soldier
with
a
yellow
stern
face
gaunt
as
a
skeletons
and
an
unshaven
gray
beard
looking
fixedly
at
rostov
the
old
soldiers
neighbor
on
one
side
was
whispering
something
to
him
pointing
at
rostov
rostov
understood
that
the
old
man
meant
to
ask
him
something
he
went
closer
and
saw
that
only
one
of
the
old
mans
legs
was
bent
under
him
the
other
was
missing
above
the
knee
the
old
mans
other
neighbor
who
lay
without
moving
his
head
thrown
back
some
distance
from
him
was
a
young
soldier
with
a
waxen
pallor
on
his
snubnosed
still
freckled
face
and
only
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showing
rostov
looked
at
this
snubnosed
soldier
and
a
chill
ran
down
his
spine
but
this
one
seems
to
be
he
turned
to
the
assistant
weve
been
asking
and
asking
your
honor
said
the
old
soldier
his
lower
jaw
trembling
he
passed
away
this
morning
were
people
too
not
dogs
ill
send
someone
at
once
hell
be
taken
away
hell
be
taken
away
the
assistant
said
hastily
if
you
please
your
honor
lets
go
lets
go
rostov
said
hastily
and
lowering
his
eyes
and
shrinking
he
tried
to
pass
unnoticed
through
the
line
of
those
reproachful
and
envious
eyes
directed
at
him
as
he
left
the
room
xviii
going
down
the
corridor
the
assistant
led
rostov
to
the
officers
wards
which
consisted
of
three
rooms
with
open
doors
in
these
rooms
there
were
beds
wounded
and
sick
officers
were
sitting
and
lying
on
them
some
walked
about
the
room
in
hospital
gowns
the
first
person
rostov
met
in
the
officers
ward
was
a
small
thin
man
without
an
arm
in
a
nightcap
and
hospital
gown
with
a
little
pipe
in
his
teeth
who
was
walking
about
the
first
room
rostov
peered
at
him
intently
trying
to
remember
where
he
had
seen
him
see
where
god
granted
us
to
meet
again
said
the
small
man
tushin
tushinremember
i
gave
you
a
ride
at
sch246ngraben
ive
had
a
bit
cut
off
see
he
said
smiling
and
showing
the
empty
sleeve
of
the
robe
its
vassily
dmitrich
denisov
youre
looking
for
hes
my
roommate
he
said
on
learning
who
rostov
wanted
this
way
this
way
and
tushin
led
him
to
the
other
room
from
which
came
the
loud
laughter
of
several
voices
how
can
they
not
only
live
here
but
even
laugh
thought
rostov
still
sensing
that
smell
of
dead
flesh
he
had
picked
up
in
the
soldiers
section
and
still
seeing
around
him
those
envious
looks
that
had
followed
after
him
on
both
sides
and
the
face
of
the
young
soldier
with
rolledup
eyes
denisov
the
blanket
pulled
over
his
head
was
asleep
in
bed
though
it
was
nearly
noon
ah
rostov
greetings
greetings
he
shouted
in
the
same
voice
he
used
in
the
regiment
but
rostov
noticed
sadly
that
behind
this
habitual
casualness
and
liveliness
some
new
bad
hidden
feeling
showed
in
the
expression
of
denisovs
face
in
his
intonations
and
words
his
wound
despite
its
insignificance
still
had
not
healed
though
it
was
now
six
weeks
since
he
was
wounded
his
face
had
the
same
pale
swollenness
of
all
the
hospital
faces
but
it
was
not
this
that
struck
rostov
what
struck
him
was
that
denisov
did
not
seem
glad
to
see
him
and
smiled
at
him
unnaturally
denisov
did
not
ask
about
the
regiment
nor
about
the
general
course
of
affairs
when
rostov
mentioned
it
denisov
did
not
listen
rostov
even
noticed
that
denisov
found
it
unpleasant
to
be
reminded
of
the
regiment
and
generally
of
that
other
free
life
that
went
on
outside
the
hospital
it
seemed
he
was
trying
to
forget
that
former
life
and
was
interested
only
in
his
case
with
the
provision
officials
to
rostovs
question
about
how
the
case
stood
he
immediately
pulled
from
under
the
pillow
a
paper
he
had
received
from
the
commission
and
the
draft
of
his
reply
to
it
when
he
started
reading
his
paper
he
became
animated
and
particularly
drew
rostovs
attention
to
the
biting
remarks
in
it
directed
at
his
enemies
denisovs
hospital
friends
who
surrounded
rostov
as
a
newly
arrived
person
from
the
free
world
gradually
began
to
disperse
as
soon
as
denisov
started
reading
his
paper
from
their
faces
rostov
understood
that
these
gentlemen
had
all
heard
the
story
more
than
once
already
and
were
tired
of
it
only
the
man
in
the
next
bed
a
fat
uhlan
stayed
sitting
on
his
cot
frowning
gloomily
and
smoking
his
pipe
and
little
onearmed
tushin
went
on
listening
shaking
his
head
disapprovingly
in
the
middle
of
the
reading
the
uhlan
interrupted
denisov
in
my
view
he
said
turning
to
rostov
he
ought
simply
to
beg
the
sovereign
for
mercy
they
say
there
will
be
lots
of
rewards
now
and
surely
hed
be
forgiven
me
beg
the
sovereign
denisov
said
in
a
voice
which
he
wanted
to
endow
with
its
former
energy
and
ardor
but
which
rang
with
futile
irritability
for
what
if
i
were
a
robber
id
ask
for
mercy
but
im
on
trial
because
i
brought
the
robbers
to
light
let
them
take
me
to
court
im
not
afraid
of
anybody
ive
served
the
tsar
and
the
fatherland
honorably
and
didnt
steal
to
demote
me
andlisten
i
just
write
to
them
straight
out
heres
what
i
write
if
i
were
an
embezzler
its
cleverly
written
theres
no
saying
its
not
said
tushin
but
thats
not
the
point
vassily
dmitrich
he
also
turned
to
rostov
a
man
ought
to
submit
but
vassily
dmitrich
here
doesnt
want
to
the
auditor
told
you
your
case
was
going
badly
well
let
it
go
badly
said
denisov
the
auditor
wrote
a
petition
for
you
tushin
went
on
and
you
ought
to
sign
it
and
see
you
can
send
it
with
him
he
pointed
to
rostov
hes
surely
got
a
hand
in
at
the
staff
there
couldnt
be
a
better
chance
yes
but
i
told
you
i
wont
go
roveling
denisov
interrupted
and
continued
reading
the
letter
rostov
did
not
dare
to
persuade
denisov
though
he
felt
instinctively
that
the
way
suggested
by
tushin
and
the
other
officers
was
the
surest
and
though
he
would
have
considered
himself
very
happy
if
he
could
have
been
of
help
to
denisov
he
knew
denisovs
inflexible
will
and
righteous
ardor
when
the
reading
of
denisovs
venomous
papers
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
over
rostov
said
nothing
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
a
very
sad
state
of
mind
in
the
company
of
denisovs
hospital
friends
who
again
gathered
around
him
he
told
them
things
he
knew
and
listened
to
what
others
had
to
say
denisov
was
gloomily
silent
throughout
the
evening
late
in
the
evening
rostov
got
ready
to
go
and
asked
denisov
whether
there
would
be
any
errands
yes
wait
said
denisov
glancing
at
the
officers
and
taking
his
papers
from
under
the
pillow
he
went
to
the
window
where
there
was
an
inkstand
and
sat
down
to
write
it
seems
you
cant
break
an
axhead
with
a
straw
he
said
coming
from
the
window
and
handing
rostov
a
large
envelope
this
was
a
petition
addressed
to
the
sovereign
drawn
up
by
the
auditor
in
which
denisov
without
mentioning
anything
about
the
failures
of
the
provisions
department
merely
begged
for
mercy
hand
it
in
since
it
seems
he
did
not
finish
and
smiled
a
painfully
false
smile
xix
having
returned
to
the
regiment
and
told
the
commander
about
the
state
of
denisovs
case
rostov
rode
on
to
tilsit
with
the
letter
to
the
sovereign
on
the
thirteenth
of
june
the
french
and
russian
emperors
met
at
tilsit
boris
drubetskoy
asked
the
important
person
to
whom
he
was
attached
that
he
be
included
in
the
suite
appointed
to
be
stationed
in
tilsit
je
voudrais
voir
le
grand
homme
he
said
referring
to
napoleon
whom
until
then
like
everyone
else
he
had
always
called
buonaparte
vous
parlez
de
buonaparte
his
general
said
to
him
smiling
boris
looked
questioningly
at
his
general
and
understood
at
once
that
this
was
a
joking
test
mon
prince
je
parle
de
lempereur
napol233on
he
replied
the
general
smiled
and
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
youll
go
far
he
said
to
him
and
took
him
along
boris
was
among
the
few
who
were
at
the
niemen
on
the
day
of
the
emperors
meeting
he
saw
the
rafts
with
monograms
and
napoleon
riding
along
the
other
bank
past
the
french
guards
saw
the
emperor
alexanders
pensive
face
as
he
sat
silently
in
a
tavern
on
the
bank
of
the
niemen
awaiting
napoleons
arrival
saw
how
both
emperors
got
into
boats
and
how
napoleon
who
was
the
first
to
reach
the
raft
stepped
forward
quickly
to
meet
alexander
and
gave
him
his
hand
and
how
the
two
disappeared
into
the
pavilion
since
the
time
of
his
entrance
into
the
higher
world
boris
had
made
it
his
habit
to
observe
attentively
what
was
happening
around
him
and
to
write
it
down
during
the
meeting
in
tilsit
he
asked
the
names
of
the
persons
who
arrived
with
napoleon
about
the
uniforms
they
were
wearing
and
listened
attentively
to
the
words
spoken
by
important
persons
at
the
moment
when
the
emperors
went
into
the
pavilion
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
he
did
not
forget
to
look
again
when
alexander
came
out
of
the
pavilion
the
meeting
had
lasted
an
hour
and
fiftythree
minutes
and
he
wrote
it
down
that
evening
among
other
facts
which
he
supposed
were
of
historic
significance
since
the
emperors
suite
was
very
small
for
a
man
who
valued
his
success
in
the
service
to
be
in
tilsit
at
the
time
of
the
emperors
meeting
was
a
very
important
matter
and
boris
having
gone
to
tilsit
felt
that
from
then
on
his
position
was
completely
assured
he
was
not
only
known
he
was
an
accustomed
and
familiar
figure
twice
he
had
been
entrusted
with
messages
to
the
sovereign
himself
so
that
the
sovereign
knew
his
face
and
all
his
attendants
were
now
not
only
not
aloof
as
before
considering
him
a
new
person
but
would
have
been
surprised
if
he
were
not
there
boris
roomed
with
another
adjutant
the
polish
count
zhilinsky
zhilinsky
a
pole
brought
up
in
paris
was
rich
passionately
loved
the
french
and
almost
every
day
during
their
stay
in
tilsit
zhilinsky
and
boris
gathered
french
officers
from
the
guards
and
french
headquarters
for
dinners
and
lunches
in
the
evening
of
the
twentyfourth
of
june
count
zhilinsky
boriss
roommate
gave
a
supper
for
his
french
acquaintances
at
this
supper
there
was
a
guest
of
honorone
of
napoleons
adjutantsas
well
as
several
officers
of
the
french
guards
and
a
young
boy
from
an
old
french
aristocratic
family
napoleons
page
on
that
same
day
rostov
taking
advantage
of
the
darkness
so
as
not
to
be
recognized
in
civilian
dress
arrived
in
tilsit
and
went
to
the
apartment
of
zhilinsky
and
boris
in
rostov
as
in
the
whole
army
from
which
he
came
that
change
in
relations
with
napoleon
and
the
french
turning
them
from
enemies
into
friends
was
still
far
from
being
accomplished
as
it
had
been
at
headquarters
and
in
boris
in
the
army
they
still
went
on
experiencing
a
mixed
feeling
of
anger
contempt
and
fear
for
bonaparte
and
the
french
still
recently
rostov
talking
with
one
of
platovs
cossack
officers
had
argued
that
if
napoleon
were
ever
taken
prisoner
he
would
be
treated
not
as
a
sovereign
but
as
a
criminal
still
recently
meeting
a
wounded
french
colonel
on
the
road
rostov
had
become
heated
proving
to
him
that
there
could
be
no
peace
between
a
legitimate
sovereign
and
the
criminal
bonaparte
therefore
rostov
was
oddly
struck
in
boriss
apartment
by
the
sight
of
french
officers
in
those
same
uniforms
which
he
was
used
to
looking
at
quite
differently
from
the
flank
line
as
soon
as
he
saw
a
french
officer
thrust
himself
out
of
the
door
that
warlike
hostile
feeling
which
he
always
experienced
at
the
sight
of
the
enemy
suddenly
took
hold
of
him
he
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
asked
in
russian
whether
drubetskoy
lived
there
boris
hearing
a
strangers
voice
in
the
front
hall
came
out
to
meet
him
his
face
when
he
recognized
rostov
at
first
expressed
annoyance
ah
its
you
very
glad
very
glad
to
see
you
he
said
anyhow
smiling
and
going
up
to
him
but
rostov
had
noticed
his
first
reaction
it
seems
i
chose
the
wrong
time
he
said
i
wouldnt
have
come
but
im
on
business
he
said
coldly
no
i
was
only
surprised
that
youve
left
the
regiment
dans
un
moment
je
suis
224
vous
he
replied
to
a
voice
that
was
calling
him
i
can
see
its
the
wrong
time
rostov
repeated
the
expression
of
annoyance
had
already
disappeared
from
boriss
face
evidently
having
reflected
and
decided
what
to
do
he
took
him
by
both
hands
with
a
particular
calm
and
led
him
to
the
neighboring
room
boriss
eyes
looking
calmly
and
firmly
at
rostov
were
as
if
veiled
by
something
as
if
some
sort
of
screenthe
blue
spectacles
of
conventionhad
been
put
on
them
so
it
seemed
to
rostov
ah
enough
please
as
if
you
could
come
at
the
wrong
time
said
boris
he
led
him
into
the
room
where
the
supper
table
had
been
laid
introduced
him
to
his
guests
giving
his
name
and
explaining
that
he
was
not
a
civilian
but
a
hussar
officer
and
his
old
friend
count
zhilinsky
le
comte
n
n
le
capitaine
s
s
he
named
his
guests
rostov
looked
frowningly
at
the
frenchmen
made
his
bows
reluctantly
and
said
nothing
zhilinsky
clearly
took
this
new
russian
person
into
his
circle
without
any
joy
and
said
nothing
to
rostov
boris
seemed
not
to
notice
the
constraint
caused
by
the
appearance
of
a
new
person
and
with
the
same
agreeable
calm
and
veiling
of
the
eyes
with
which
he
had
met
rostov
tried
to
enliven
the
conversation
one
of
the
frenchmen
turned
with
habitual
french
politeness
to
the
stubbornly
silent
rostov
and
said
to
him
that
he
had
probably
come
to
tilsit
to
see
the
emperor
no
im
on
business
rostov
answered
curtly
rostov
felt
illhumored
immediately
after
he
noticed
the
displeasure
on
boriss
face
and
as
always
happens
with
people
who
are
illhumored
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
was
looking
at
him
hostilely
and
that
he
was
hampering
them
all
and
indeed
he
was
hampering
them
all
and
alone
remained
outside
the
newly
initiated
general
conversation
why
is
he
sitting
here
said
the
glances
cast
at
him
by
the
guests
he
got
up
and
went
over
to
boris
anyhow
im
in
your
way
he
said
softly
to
him
lets
go
and
talk
business
and
ill
leave
why
no
not
in
the
least
said
boris
but
if
youre
tired
lets
go
to
my
room
and
you
can
lie
down
to
rest
yes
in
fact
they
went
into
the
small
room
where
boris
slept
rostov
not
sitting
down
at
once
with
irritationas
if
boris
was
guilty
before
him
for
somethingbegan
telling
him
about
denisovs
case
asking
whether
he
could
and
would
intercede
for
denisov
with
the
sovereign
through
his
general
and
deliver
his
letter
through
him
when
they
were
alone
rostov
realized
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
awkward
for
him
to
look
boris
in
the
eye
boris
crossing
his
legs
and
stroking
the
slender
fingers
of
his
right
hand
with
his
left
listened
to
rostov
the
way
a
general
listens
to
the
report
of
a
subordinate
now
looking
away
now
looking
directly
into
rostovs
eyes
with
the
same
veiled
gaze
each
time
that
happened
rostov
felt
awkward
and
lowered
his
eyes
ive
heard
about
cases
of
that
sort
and
i
know
that
the
sovereign
is
very
severe
on
such
occasions
i
think
it
should
not
get
as
far
as
his
majesty
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
better
to
ask
the
corps
commander
directlybut
generally
i
think
if
you
dont
want
to
do
anything
just
say
so
rostov
nearly
shouted
not
looking
into
boriss
eyes
boris
smiled
on
the
contrary
ill
do
what
i
can
only
i
thought
just
then
zhilinskys
voice
was
heard
at
the
door
calling
boris
well
go
go
said
rostov
and
declining
supper
and
remaining
alone
in
the
little
room
he
paced
up
and
down
for
a
long
time
and
listened
to
the
merry
french
talk
in
the
next
room
xx
rostov
had
come
to
tilsit
on
the
day
least
suitable
of
all
for
interceding
on
denisovs
behalf
he
could
not
go
to
the
general
on
duty
himself
because
he
was
wearing
a
tailcoat
and
had
come
to
tilsit
without
permission
of
the
authorities
while
boris
even
if
he
wanted
to
could
not
do
it
on
the
day
after
rostovs
arrival
on
that
day
the
twentyseventh
of
june
the
preliminary
conditions
for
peace
were
signed
the
emperors
exchanged
decorations
alexander
received
the
legion
of
honor
and
napoleon
the
st
andrew
of
the
first
degree
and
on
that
day
a
dinner
was
arranged
for
the
preobrazhensky
battalion
given
by
the
battalion
of
the
french
guards
both
sovereigns
were
to
be
present
at
this
banquet
for
rostov
it
was
so
awkward
and
unpleasant
to
be
with
boris
that
when
boris
looked
in
on
him
after
supper
he
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
the
next
day
he
left
the
house
early
in
the
morning
trying
not
to
see
him
nikolai
wandered
around
town
in
a
tailcoat
and
a
round
hat
gazing
at
the
french
and
their
uniforms
and
at
the
streets
and
houses
where
the
russian
and
french
emperors
lived
in
the
square
he
saw
tables
being
set
up
and
preparations
being
made
for
the
dinner
in
the
streets
he
saw
draperies
hung
across
with
flags
in
the
russian
and
french
colors
and
huge
monograms
of
a
and
n
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
there
were
also
flags
and
monograms
boris
doesnt
want
to
help
me
and
i
dont
want
to
turn
to
him
thats
settled
thought
nikolai
its
all
over
between
us
but
i
wont
leave
here
without
doing
all
i
can
for
denisov
and
above
all
without
delivering
the
letter
to
the
sovereign
to
the
sovereign
hes
here
thought
rostov
involuntarily
coming
up
again
to
the
house
occupied
by
alexander
saddle
horses
stood
by
this
house
and
the
suite
was
gathering
evidently
preparing
for
the
sovereigns
levee
i
may
see
him
any
moment
thought
rostov
if
only
i
could
deliver
the
letter
to
him
directly
and
tell
him
everythingwould
they
really
arrest
me
for
my
tailcoat
it
cant
be
he
would
understand
whose
side
justice
is
on
he
understands
everything
knows
everything
who
can
be
more
just
and
magnanimous
than
he
well
and
if
they
arrest
me
for
being
here
whats
so
bad
about
that
he
thought
looking
at
an
officer
going
into
the
house
occupied
by
the
sovereign
people
do
go
in
eh
its
all
nonsense
ill
go
and
deliver
the
letter
to
the
sovereign
myself
so
much
the
worse
for
drubetskoy
who
drove
me
to
it
and
suddenly
with
a
resoluteness
which
he
did
not
expect
of
himself
rostov
felt
for
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
went
straight
to
the
house
occupied
by
the
sovereign
no
im
not
going
to
let
the
chance
slip
now
as
i
did
after
austerlitz
he
thought
expecting
to
meet
the
sovereign
any
moment
and
feeling
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
it
ill
fall
at
his
feet
and
plead
with
him
hell
raise
me
up
listen
to
me
and
even
thank
me
im
happy
when
i
can
do
good
but
to
set
right
an
injustice
is
the
greatest
happiness
rostov
imagined
the
words
that
the
sovereign
would
say
to
him
and
he
walked
past
curious
onlookers
up
the
porch
of
the
house
which
the
sovereign
occupied
from
the
porch
a
broad
stairway
led
straight
up
to
the
right
he
saw
a
closed
door
under
the
stairway
was
the
door
leading
to
the
ground
floor
whom
do
you
want
someone
asked
to
deliver
a
letter
a
petition
to
his
majesty
nikolai
said
in
a
trembling
voice
a
petitiongo
to
the
officer
on
duty
this
way
please
he
pointed
him
to
the
downstairs
door
only
you
wont
be
received
hearing
this
indifferent
voice
rostov
became
frightened
of
what
he
was
doing
the
thought
of
meeting
the
sovereign
at
any
moment
was
so
seductive
and
therefore
so
frightening
for
him
that
he
was
ready
to
flee
but
an
attendant
meeting
him
opened
the
door
of
the
officer
on
duty
and
rostov
went
in
a
short
stout
man
of
about
thirty
in
white
trousers
top
boots
and
nothing
but
an
evidently
justputon
cambric
shirt
was
standing
in
this
room
a
valet
behind
him
was
buttoning
on
a
pair
of
splendid
new
silkembroidered
suspenders
which
rostov
noticed
for
some
reason
this
man
was
talking
to
someone
in
the
next
room
bien
faite
et
la
beaut233
du
diable
this
man
was
saying
and
seeing
rostov
he
stopped
speaking
and
frowned
what
can
i
do
for
you
a
petition
questce
que
cest
asked
someone
from
the
other
room
encore
un
petitionnaire
replied
the
man
in
suspenders
later
tell
him
hell
be
coming
out
in
a
minute
we
have
to
go
later
later
tomorrow
theres
no
time
rostov
turned
and
was
about
to
leave
but
the
man
in
suspenders
stopped
him
who
sent
you
who
are
you
from
major
denisov
rostov
replied
who
are
you
an
officer
lieutenant
count
rostov
what
boldness
appeal
through
the
chain
of
command
and
take
yourself
away
away
and
he
began
getting
into
the
tunic
that
the
valet
was
holding
for
him
rostov
went
to
the
front
hall
again
and
noticed
that
there
were
already
many
officers
and
generals
in
fulldress
uniform
past
whom
he
would
have
to
walk
cursing
his
boldness
his
heart
sinking
at
the
thought
that
he
could
meet
the
sovereign
at
any
moment
be
disgraced
before
him
and
put
under
arrest
fully
understanding
all
the
inappropriateness
of
his
behavior
and
regretting
it
rostov
with
lowered
eyes
was
making
his
way
out
of
the
house
surrounded
by
the
crowd
of
the
brilliant
suite
when
someones
familiar
voice
called
him
and
someones
hand
stopped
him
what
are
you
doing
here
in
a
tailcoat
my
lad
the
bass
voice
asked
him
it
was
a
cavalry
general
who
had
earned
special
favor
from
the
sovereign
during
this
campaign
the
former
commander
of
the
division
in
which
rostov
served
rostov
fearfully
began
to
justify
himself
but
seeing
the
generals
goodnaturedly
joking
face
led
him
aside
and
in
an
agitated
voice
told
him
the
whole
affair
begging
the
general
to
intercede
for
denisov
whom
he
knew
the
general
listened
to
rostov
shaking
his
head
gravely
a
pity
a
pity
for
the
fine
fellow
give
me
the
letter
rostov
barely
had
time
to
hand
him
the
letter
and
tell
him
all
about
denisovs
case
before
the
sound
of
quick
footsteps
with
spurs
was
heard
from
the
stairway
and
the
general
leaving
him
moved
towards
the
porch
the
gentlemen
of
the
sovereigns
suite
ran
down
the
steps
and
went
to
their
horses
the
groom
hayne
the
same
one
who
had
been
at
austerlitz
led
up
the
sovereigns
horse
and
from
the
stairs
came
a
light
creak
of
footsteps
which
rostov
knew
at
once
forgetting
the
danger
of
being
recognized
rostov
with
some
curious
townsfolk
moved
close
to
the
porch
and
again
after
two
years
saw
the
same
adored
features
the
same
face
the
same
gaze
the
same
gait
the
same
combination
of
majesty
and
mildnessand
the
feeling
of
rapture
and
love
for
the
sovereign
rose
again
with
its
old
force
in
rostovs
soul
the
sovereign
in
the
preobrazhensky
tunic
white
buckskin
breeches
and
high
top
boots
with
a
star
rostov
did
not
know
it
was
the
l233gion
dhonneur
came
out
to
the
porch
holding
his
hat
under
his
arm
and
putting
on
a
glove
he
stopped
looked
about
and
illuminated
everything
around
him
with
his
gaze
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
one
of
the
generals
he
also
recognized
the
former
commander
of
rostovs
division
smiled
to
him
and
called
him
over
the
entire
suite
now
drew
back
and
rostov
saw
the
general
speak
about
something
with
the
sovereign
for
a
rather
long
time
the
sovereign
said
a
few
words
to
him
and
took
a
step
towards
his
horse
again
the
crowd
of
the
suite
and
the
crowd
of
the
street
in
which
rostov
stood
moved
towards
the
sovereign
stopping
by
his
horse
and
placing
his
hand
on
the
saddle
the
sovereign
turned
to
the
cavalry
general
and
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
obviously
wishing
everyone
to
hear
him
i
cannot
general
and
the
reason
why
i
cannot
is
that
the
law
is
stronger
than
i
said
the
sovereign
and
he
raised
his
foot
to
the
stirrup
the
general
inclined
his
head
deferentially
the
sovereign
mounted
and
rode
down
the
street
at
a
gallop
rostov
beside
himself
with
rapture
ran
after
him
with
the
crowd
xxi
on
the
square
to
which
the
sovereign
was
riding
there
stood
facing
each
other
on
the
right
the
preobrazhensky
battalion
and
on
the
left
the
battalion
of
the
french
guards
in
their
bearskin
hats
as
the
sovereign
was
approaching
one
flank
of
the
battalions
which
presented
arms
another
group
of
horsemen
was
riding
up
to
the
opposite
flank
and
at
the
head
of
them
rostov
recognized
napoleon
it
could
not
have
been
anyone
else
he
rode
at
a
gallop
in
a
small
hat
with
the
sash
of
st
andrew
across
his
shoulder
in
a
blue
tunic
unbuttoned
over
a
white
camisole
on
an
extraordinary
purebred
gray
arabian
stallion
on
a
goldembroidered
crimson
shabrack
riding
up
to
alexander
he
raised
his
hat
and
as
he
did
so
rostovs
cavalry
eye
could
not
help
noticing
that
napoleon
sat
his
horse
poorly
and
unsteadily
the
battalions
shouted
hurrah
and
vive
lempereur
napoleon
said
something
to
alexander
the
two
emperors
got
off
their
horses
and
took
each
others
hands
napoleons
face
wore
an
unpleasantly
false
smile
alexander
was
saying
something
to
him
with
a
benign
expression
rostov
not
taking
his
eyes
away
despite
the
trampling
of
the
french
gendarmes
horses
attempting
to
move
the
crowd
back
followed
every
movement
of
the
emperor
alexander
and
bonaparte
he
was
struck
as
if
it
was
unexpected
by
the
fact
that
alexander
behaved
as
an
equal
with
bonaparte
and
that
bonaparte
quite
freely
as
if
such
closeness
to
the
sovereign
was
natural
and
habitual
to
him
treated
the
russian
tsar
as
an
equal
alexander
and
napoleon
with
the
long
tail
of
their
suite
approached
the
right
flank
of
the
preobrazhensky
battalion
riding
straight
at
the
crowd
that
was
standing
there
the
crowd
unexpectedly
found
itself
so
close
to
the
emperors
that
rostov
who
was
standing
in
the
first
rows
was
afraid
he
would
be
recognized
sire
je
vous
demande
la
permission
de
donner
la
l233gion
dhonneur
au
plus
brave
de
vos
soldats
said
a
sharp
precise
voice
articulating
every
letter
this
was
spoken
by
the
short
bonaparte
looking
from
below
straight
into
alexanders
eyes
alexander
listened
attentively
to
what
was
said
to
him
and
inclining
his
head
smiled
pleasantly
192
celui

le
plus

guerre
napoleon
added
rapping
out
every
syllable
with
a
calm
and
assurance
that
rostov
found
outrageous
and
looking
over
the
ranks
of
russian
soldiers
standing
at
attention
before
him
still
presenting
arms
and
looking
fixedly
at
the
face
of
their
emperor
votre
majest233
me
permettratelle
de
demander
lavis
du
colonel
said
alexander
and
took
a
few
hasty
steps
towards
prince
kozlovsky
the
commander
of
the
battalion
bonaparte
meanwhile
began
to
remove
the
glove
from
his
small
white
hand
tore
it
and
threw
it
down
an
adjutant
hastily
rushing
forward
from
behind
picked
it
up
to
whom
should
it
be
given
the
emperor
alexander
said
softly
to
kozlovsky
in
russian
to
whomever
you
order
your
majesty
the
sovereign
winced
with
displeasure
and
looking
around
said
but
i
must
give
him
an
answer
kozlovsky
with
a
resolute
air
looked
over
the
ranks
and
in
that
look
took
in
rostov
what
if
its
me
thought
rostov
lazarev
the
colonel
commanded
frowning
and
lazarev
the
first
soldier
in
the
rank
briskly
stepped
forward
where
are
you
going
stop
right
there
voices
whispered
to
lazarev
who
did
not
know
where
to
go
lazarev
stopped
casting
a
fearful
sidelong
glance
at
the
colonel
and
his
face
twitched
as
happens
with
soldiers
called
out
of
line
napoleon
turned
his
head
slightly
and
held
out
his
small
plump
hand
behind
him
as
if
wishing
to
take
something
the
persons
of
his
suite
guessing
that
very
second
what
was
wanted
began
fussing
whispering
handing
something
on
and
the
page
the
same
one
rostov
had
seen
the
day
before
at
boriss
ran
forward
and
bending
deferentially
over
the
proffered
hand
and
without
making
it
wait
a
single
second
placed
in
it
the
decoration
on
its
red
ribbon
napoleon
not
looking
closed
two
fingers
the
decoration
was
between
them
napoleon
went
up
to
lazarev
who
staring
wideeyed
stubbornly
went
on
looking
only
at
his
sovereign
and
gave
the
emperor
alexander
a
glance
showing
thereby
that
what
he
was
now
doing
he
was
doing
for
his
ally
the
small
white
hand
with
the
decoration
touched
the
soldier
lazarevs
button
it
was
as
if
napoleon
knew
that
for
this
soldier
to
be
happy
rewarded
and
distinguished
from
everyone
else
in
the
world
it
was
only
necessary
that
his
napoleons
hand
deign
to
touch
the
soldiers
breast
napoleon
merely
laid
the
cross
on
lazarevs
breast
and
lowering
his
hand
turned
to
alexander
as
if
he
knew
that
the
cross
must
stick
to
lazarevs
breast
the
cross
did
stick
because
obliging
russian
and
french
hands
instantly
picked
it
up
and
fastened
it
to
the
tunic
lazarev
glanced
darkly
at
the
little
man
with
white
hands
who
had
done
something
to
him
and
motionless
continuing
to
present
arms
again
began
gazing
straight
into
alexanders
eyes
as
if
asking
alexander
if
he
should
go
on
standing
there
or
would
now
be
ordered
to
take
a
few
steps
or
perhaps
to
do
something
else
but
he
was
not
ordered
to
do
anything
and
he
remained
in
that
motionless
state
for
a
rather
long
time
the
sovereigns
got
on
their
horses
and
left
the
preobrazhensky
battalion
breaking
ranks
mingled
with
the
french
guards
and
sat
down
at
the
tables
prepared
for
them
lazarev
sat
in
the
place
of
honor
he
was
embraced
congratulated
his
hands
were
shaken
by
russian
and
french
officers
crowds
of
officers
and
people
came
merely
to
look
at
lazarev
a
droning
of
russian
and
french
talk
and
laughter
hung
over
the
tables
on
the
square
two
officers
with
flushed
faces
merry
and
happy
walked
past
him
what
a
treat
brotherall
on
silver
said
one
have
you
seen
lazarev
yes
tomorrow
they
say
the
preobrazhensky
battalion
will
be

hosts
no
but
what

a
preobrazhensky

putting

a
frenchmans
shaggy

charming

did
you
hear
the
passwords
one
officer
of

guards
said
to

to

of
the
french
guards
no
way
out
of
it
he
has
to
respond
in
kind
boris
with
his
comrade
zhilinsky
also
came
to
look
at
the
preobrazhensky
banquet
on
his
way
home
boris
noticed
rostov
standing
by
the
corner
of
a
house
rostov
greetings
we
havent
seen
each
other
he
said
and
could
not
help
asking
what
had
happened
to
him
so
strangely
dark
and
upset
was
rostovs
face
never
mind
never
mind
replied
rostov
will
you
stop
by
yes
rostov
stood
at
the
corner
for
a
long
time
looking
at
the
feasting
men
from
a
distance
painful
work
was
going
on
in
his
mind
which
he
could
not
bring
to
an
end
terrible
doubts
arose
in
his
soul
now
he
remembered
denisov
with
his
changed
expression
his
submission
and
the
whole
hospital
with
those
tornoff
arms
and
legs
that
filth
and
disease
he
imagined
so
vividly
now
that
hospital
stench
of
dead
flesh
that
he
looked
around
to
see
where
the
stench
could
be
coming
from
then
he
remembered
that
selfsatisfied
bonaparte
with
his
white
little
hand
who
was
now
an
emperor
whom
the
emperor
alexander
liked
and
respected
why
then
those
tornoff
arms
and
legs
those
dead
people
then
he
remembered
the
rewarded
lazarev
and
denisov
punished
and
unforgiven
he
caught
himself
in
such
strange
thoughts
that
it
made
him
frightened
the
smell
of
the
preobrazhenskys
food
and
his
own
hunger
brought
him
out
of
that
state
he
had
to
eat
something
before
he
left
he
went
to
the
inn
he
had
noticed
in
the
morning
in
the
inn
he
found
so
many
people
and
officers
who
had
come
as
he
had
in
civilian
dress
that
he
had
a
hard
time
getting
dinner
two
officers
of
his
division
joined
him
the
conversation
naturally
turned
to
the
peace
the
officers
rostovs
comrades
like
the
greater
the
army
were
displeased
with
the
peace
concluded
after
friedland
they
said
that
if
we
had
held
out
a
little
longer
napoleon
would
have
been
done
for
that
there
were
no
biscuits
or
shot
left
in
his
army
nikolai
ate
silently
and
mostly
drank
he
drank
two
bottles
of
wine
by
himself
the
inner
work
that
had
arisen
in
him
not
being
resolved
still
pained
him
he
was
afraid
to
give
himself
to
his
thoughts
and
yet
could
not
get
rid
of
them
suddenly
to
the
words
of
one
of
the
officers
that
it
was
offensive
to
look
at
the
french
rostov
began
shouting
with
a
vehemence
that
was
in
no
way
justified
and
therefore
surprised
the
officers
very
much
and
how
can
you
judge
what
would
have
been
better
he
shouted
his
face
suddenly
suffused
with
blood
how
can
you
judge
the
sovereigns
actions
what
right
have
we
to
discuss
it
we
can
understand
neither
the
goals
nor
the
actions
of
the
sovereign
but
i
didnt
say
a
word
about
the
sovereign
the
officer
defended
himself
unable
to
explain
rostovs
outburst
otherwise
than
by
his
being
drunk
but
rostov
was
not
listening
were
not
diplomatic
officials
were
soldiers
and
nothing
more
he
went
on
were
told
to
dieand
we
die
if
were
punished
it
means
were
guilty
its
not
for
us
to
judge
if
it
pleases
the
sovereign
emperor
to
recognize
bonaparte
as
emperor
and
conclude
an
alliance
with
himit
means
it
has
to
be
so
and
if
we
start
judging
and
reasoning
about
everything
then
therell
be
nothing
sacred
left
next
well
be
saying
theres
no
god
no
anything
shouted
nikolai
banging
the
table
quite
inappropriately
in
his
interlocutors
opinion
but
quite
in
keeping
with
his
own
train
of
thought
our
business
is
to
do
our
duty
to
cut
and
slash
not
to
think
thats
all
he
concluded
and
to
drink
said
one
of
the
officers
unwilling
to
quarrel
yes
and
to
drink
nikolai
picked
up
hey
you
another
bottle
he
shouted
i
in
1808
the
emperor
alexander
went
to
erfurt
for
a
new
meeting
with
the
emperor
napoleon
and
there
was
much
talk
in
petersburg
high
society
about
the
grandeur
of
this
solemn
meeting
in
1809
the
closeness
of
the
two
rulers
of
the
world
as
napoleon
and
alexander
were
called
had
reached
the
point
that
when
napoleon
declared
war
on
austria
that
year
a
russian
corps
went
abroad
to
assist
their
former
enemy
bonaparte
against
their
former
ally
the
austrian
emperor
and
there
was
talk
in
high
circles
about
the
possibility
of
marriage
between
napoleon
and
one
of
the
emperor
alexanders
sisters
but
besides
considerations
of
foreign
policy
the
attention
of
russian
society
at
that
time
was
turned
with
particular
keenness
to
the
internal
reforms
that
were
then
being
carried
out
in
all
parts
of
the
government
life
meanwhile
peoples
real
life
with
its
essential
concerns
of
health
illness
work
rest
with
its
concerns
of
thought
learning
poetry
music
love
friendship
hatred
passions
went
on
as
always
independently
and
outside
of
any
political
closeness
or
enmity
with
napoleon
bonaparte
and
outside
all
possible
reforms
prince
andrei
had
been
living
in
the
country
for
two
years
without
a
break
all
those
undertakings
which
pierre
had
initiated
on
his
estates
and
had
not
brought
to
any
result
constantly
changing
from
one
thing
to
anotherall
these
undertakings
without
talking
about
them
to
anyone
and
without
any
noticeable
effort
had
been
carried
out
by
prince
andrei
he
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
that
practical
tenacity
lacking
in
pierre
which
kept
things
in
motion
without
any
big
gestures
and
efforts
on
his
part
on
one
of
his
estates
of
three
hundred
souls
the
peasants
were
registered
as
free
plowmen
this
was
one
of
the
first
examples
in
russia
on
some
others
the
corv233e
was
replaced
by
quitrent
a
trained
midwife
was
invited
to
bogucharovo
at
his
expense
to
help
women
in
childbirth
and
a
priest
was
paid
to
teach
the
children
of
the
peasants
and
servants
to
read
and
write
prince
andrei
spent
half
his
time
at
bald
hills
with
his
father
and
his
son
who
was
still
in
the
care
of
nannies
the
other
half
in
his
bogucharovo
cloister
as
his
father
called
his
estate
despite
the
indifference
he
had
displayed
to
pierre
towards
all
external
events
in
the
world
he
followed
them
assiduously
received
many
books
and
to
his
own
astonishment
noticed
when
people
from
petersburg
came
to
visit
him
or
his
father
fresh
from
the
very
whirlwind
of
life
that
these
people
in
their
knowledge
of
all
that
was
happening
in
external
and
internal
politics
were
far
behind
him
who
sat
all
the
time
in
the
country
besides
being
taken
up
with
his
estates
besides
being
generally
taken
up
with
reading
the
most
varied
books
prince
andrei
was
taken
up
at
that
time
with
a
critical
analysis
of
our
last
two
unfortunate
campaigns
and
with
drawing
up
a
project
for
change
in
our
military
regulations
and
statutes
in
the
spring
of
1809
prince
andrei
went
to
his
sons
ryazan
estates
of
which
he
was
the
trustee
warmed
by
the
spring
sun
he
sat
in
his
open
carriage
looking
at
the
first
grass
the
first
birch
leaves
and
the
first
billows
of
white
spring
clouds
racing
across
the
bright
blue
sky
he
was
not
thinking
about
anything
but
looked
around
cheerfully
and
meaninglessly
they
crossed
the
ferry
on
which
he
had
talked
with
pierre
a
year
before
they
drove
past
a
dirty
village
threshing
floors
sprouting
fields
down
a
slope
with
residual
snow
by
a
bridge
up
a
slope
of
muddy
clay
past
strips
of
stubble
and
bushes
greening
here
and
there
and
entered
a
birch
woods
on
both
sides
of
the
road
it
was
almost
hot
in
the
woods
the
wind
was
not
felt
the
birches
all
strewn
with
sticky
green
leaves
did
not
stir
and
the
first
green
grass
and
purple
flowers
were
poking
through
and
lifting
up
last
years
leaves
small
fir
trees
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
birches
were
an
unpleasant
reminder
of
winter
with
their
crude
evergreen
needles
the
horses
began
to
snort
as
they
drove
into
the
woods
and
sweated
more
visibly
the
footman
pyotr
said
something
to
the
coachman
the
coachman
answered
affirmatively
but
evidently
the
coachmans
sympathy
was
not
enough
for
pyotr
he
turned
on
the
box
towards
his
master
your
excellency
how
light
it
feels
he
said
smiling
respectfully
what
it
feels
light
your
excellency
whats
he
talking
about
thought
prince
andrei
ah
the
spring
probably
he
thought
looking
about
so
it
is
everythings
green
alreadyso
quickly
birches
and
bird
cherry
and
alders
already
beginningbut
no
sign
of
oaks
ah
theres
one
at
the
side
of
the
road
stood
an
oak
probably
ten
times
older
than
the
birches
of
the
woods
it
was
ten
times
as
thick
and
twice
as
tall
as
any
birch
it
was
an
enormous
oak
twice
the
span
of
a
mans
arms
in
girth
with
some
limbs
broken
off
long
ago
and
broken
bark
covered
with
old
scars
with
its
huge
gnarled
ungainly
unsymmetrically
spread
arms
and
fingers
it
stood
old
angry
scornful
and
ugly
amidst
the
smiling
birches
it
alone
did
not
want
to
submit
to
the
charm
of
spring
and
did
not
want
to
see
either
the
springtime
or
the
sun
spring
and
love
and
happiness
the
oak
seemed
to
say
and
how
is
it
youre
not
bored
with
the
same
stupid
senseless
deception
always
the
same
and
always
a
deception
there
is
no
spring
no
sun
no
happiness
look
there
sit
those
smothered
dead
fir
trees
always
the
same
look
at
me
spreading
my
broken
flayed
fingers
wherever
they
growfrom
my
back
from
my
sides
as
theyve
grown
so
i
stand
and
i
dont
believe
in
your
hopes
and
deceptions
prince
andrei
turned
several
times
to
look
at
this
oak
as
he
drove
through
the
woods
as
if
he
expected
something
from
it
there
were
flowers
and
grass
beneath
the
oak
as
well
but
it
stood
among
them
in
the
same
way
scowling
motionless
ugly
and
stubborn
yes
its
right
a
thousand
times
right
this
oak
thought
prince
andrei
let
others
the
young
ones
succumb
afresh
to
this
deception
but
we
know
lifeour
life
is
over
a
whole
new
series
of
thoughts
in
connection
with
the
oak
hopeless
but
sadly
pleasant
emerged
in
prince
andreis
soul
during
this
journey
it
was
as
if
he
again
thought
over
his
whole
life
and
reached
the
same
old
comforting
and
hopeless
conclusion
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
start
anything
that
he
had
to
live
out
his
life
without
doing
evil
without
anxiety
and
without
wishing
for
anything
ii
on
business
to
do
with
the
trusteeship
of
the
ryazan
estates
prince
andrei
had
to
see
the
provincial
marshal
of
nobility
the
marshal
was
count
ilya
andreevich
rostov
and
in
the
middle
of
may
prince
andrei
went
to
see
him
it
was
now
the
hot
period
of
spring
the
woods
were
now
fully
clothed
it
was
dusty
and
so
hot
that
passing
by
water
one
wanted
to
go
for
a
swim
prince
andrei
cheerless
and
preoccupied
by
considerations
of
one
thing
and
another
that
he
had
to
ask
the
marshal
to
do
with
business
was
driving
up
the
garden
avenue
to
the
rostovs
house
in
otradnoe
from
behind
the
trees
on
the
right
he
heard
merry
feminine
cries
and
saw
a
crowd
of
girls
running
across
the
path
of
his
carriage
ahead
of
the
others
closer
a
darkhaired
girl
came
running
towards
the
carriage
very
slender
strangely
slender
darkeyed
in
a
yellow
cotton
dress
her
head
tied
with
a
white
kerchief
from
under
which
strands
of
loose
hair
escaped
the
girl
was
shouting
something
but
seeing
the
stranger
ran
back
laughing
without
looking
at
him
for
some
reason
prince
andrei
suddenly
felt
pained
the
day
was
so
beautiful
the
sun
was
so
bright
everything
around
was
so
cheerful
and
this
slender
and
pretty
girl
did
not
know
and
did
not
want
to
know
of
his
existence
and
was
content
and
happy
with
some
separateprobably
stupidbut
cheerful
and
happy
life
of
her
own
what
is
she
so
glad
of
what
is
she
thinking
about
not
about
military
regulations
not
about
setting
up
quitrenters
in
ryazan
what
is
she
thinking
about
and
what
makes
her
happy
prince
andrei
asked
himself
with
involuntary
curiosity
in
1809
count
ilya
andreich
was
living
in
otradnoe
in
the
same
way
as
before
that
is
receiving
almost
the
entire
province
with
hunts
theatricals
dinners
and
musicians
he
was
glad
to
see
prince
andrei
as
he
was
to
see
any
new
guest
and
almost
forced
him
to
spend
the
night
in
the
course
of
a
boring
day
during
which
prince
andrei
was
entertained
by
the
older
hosts
and
the
most
respected
guests
who
filled
the
old
counts
house
on
the
occasion
of
an
approaching
nameday
party
bolkonsky
glanced
several
times
at
natasha
who
was
laughing
at
something
and
having
fun
among
the
other
young
half
of
the
company
still
asking
himself
what
is
she
thinking
about
what
is
she
so
glad
of
in
the
evening
left
alone
in
a
new
place
he
could
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
time
he
read
then
put
out
the
candle
but
lit
it
again
the
room
with
the
shutters
closed
from
inside
was
hot
he
was
vexed
with
this
stupid
old
man
as
he
called
rostov
who
had
detained
him
assuring
him
that
the
necessary
papers
had
not
yet
been
brought
from
town
and
vexed
with
himself
for
having
stayed
prince
andrei
got
up
and
went
to
open
the
window
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
shutters
moonlight
as
if
it
had
been
watching
at
the
window
a
long
time
waiting
for
that
burst
into
the
room
he
opened
the
window
the
night
was
fresh
and
stilly
bright
just
under
his
window
was
a
row
of
trimmed
trees
black
on
one
side
and
silvery
bright
on
the
other
under
the
trees
was
some
juicy
wet
curly
growth
with
touches
of
silver
on
its
leaves
and
stems
further
beyond
the
black
trees
was
some
roof
glistening
with
dew
to
the
right
a
big
curly
tree
with
a
bright
white
trunk
and
branches
and
above
it
a
nearly
full
moon
against
the
light
nearly
starless
spring
sky
prince
andrei
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
windowsill
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
this
sky
prince
andreis
room
was
on
the
middle
floor
there
were
also
people
in
the
rooms
above
him
and
they
were
not
asleep
he
heard
feminine
talk
overhead
just
one
more
time
said
a
feminine
voice
overhead
which
prince
andrei
recognized
at
once
but
when
are
you
going
to
sleep
another
voice
replied
i
dont
want
to
i
cant
sleep
what
am
i
to
do
well
one
last
time
two
feminine
voices
sang
some
musical
phrase
which
made
up
the
end
of
something
ah
how
lovely
well
now
lets
sleep
thats
the
end
you
sleep
i
cant
the
first
voice
answered
coming
close
to
the
window
she
evidently
leaned
all
the
way
out
of
the
window
because
he
could
hear
the
rustle
of
her
dress
and
even
her
breathing
everything
became
hushed
and
stonestill
like
the
moon
and
its
light
and
shadows
prince
andrei
was
also
afraid
to
stir
lest
he
betray
his
involuntary
presence
sonya
sonya
the
first
voice
was
heard
again
how
can
you
sleep
just
look
how
lovely
it
is
ah
how
lovely
wake
up
sonya
she
said
almost
with
tears
in
her
voice
theres
never
never
been
such
a
lovely
night
sonya
made
some
grudging
reply
no
just
look
what
a
moonah
how
lovely
come
here
darling
dear
heart
come
here
well
you
see
id
like
to
sit
on
my
heels
like
this
take
myself
by
the
kneestight
as
tight
as
possible
youve
got
to
strainand
fly
away
like
this
enough
youll
fall
sounds
of
a
struggle
were
heard
and
sonyas
displeased
voice
its
past
one
oclock
oh
you
just
spoil
everything
for
me
well
go
go
everything
fell
silent
again
but
prince
andrei
knew
that
she
was
still
sitting
up
there
he
heard
an
occasional
quiet
stirring
an
occasional
sigh
ah
my
god
my
god
what
on
earth
is
it
she
suddenly
cried
if
its
sleep
its
sleep
and
she
slammed
the
window
she
doesnt
care
at
all
about
my
existence
prince
andrei
thought
all
the
while
he
was
listening
to
her
talk
for
some
reason
expecting
and
fearing
that
she
would
say
something
about
him
and
she
again
as
if
on
purpose
he
thought
in
his
soul
there
suddenly
arose
such
an
unexpected
tangle
of
youthful
thoughts
and
hopes
contradictory
to
his
whole
life
that
feeling
himself
unable
to
comprehend
his
own
state
he
fell
asleep
at
once
iii
the
next
day
having
taken
leave
of
the
count
alone
without
waiting
for
the
ladies
to
come
out
prince
andrei
drove
home
it
was
already
the
beginning
of
june
when
prince
andrei
on
his
way
home
drove
again
into
that
birch
woods
where
that
gnarled
old
oak
had
struck
him
so
strangely
and
memorably
the
ringing
of
the
harness
bells
was
still
more
muffled
in
the
woods
than
a
month
ago
everything
was
filled
out
shady
and
dense
and
the
young
firs
scattered
through
the
woods
did
not
disrupt
the
overall
beauty
and
imitating
the
general
character
showed
the
tender
green
of
their
fluffy
young
shoots
the
whole
day
had
been
hot
there
was
a
thunderstorm
gathering
somewhere
but
only
a
small
cloud
had
sent
a
sprinkle
over
the
dust
of
the
road
and
the
juicy
leaves
the
left
side
of
the
woods
was
dark
in
the
shade
the
right
side
wet
glossy
sparkled
in
the
sun
barely
swayed
by
the
wind
everything
was
in
flower
nightingales
throbbed
and
trilled
now
near
now
far
yes
here
in
this
woods
was
that
oak
that
i
agreed
with
thought
prince
andrei
but
where
is
it
he
thought
again
looking
at
the
left
side
of
the
road
and
not
knowing
it
himself
not
recognizing
it
he
admired
the
very
oak
he
was
looking
for
the
old
oak
quite
transformed
spreading
out
a
canopy
of
juicy
dark
greenery
basked
barely
swaying
in
the
rays
of
the
evening
sun
of
the
gnarled
fingers
the
scars
the
old
grief
and
mistrustnothing
could
be
seen
juicy
green
leaves
without
branches
broke
through
the
stiff
hundredyearold
bark
and
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
this
old
fellow
had
produced
them
yes
its
the
same
oak
thought
prince
andrei
and
suddenly
a
causeless
springtime
feeling
of
joy
and
renewal
came
over
him
all
the
best
moments
of
his
life
suddenly
recalled
themselves
to
him
at
the
same
time
austerlitz
with
the
lofty
sky
and
the
dead
reproachful
face
of
his
wife
and
pierre
on
the
ferry
and
a
girl
excited
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
and
that
night
itself
and
the
moonall
of
it
suddenly
recalled
itself
to
him
no
life
isnt
over
at
the
age
of
thirtyone
prince
andrei
suddenly
decided
definitively
immutably
its
not
enough
that
i
know
all
thats
in
me
everyone
else
must
know
it
too
pierre
and
that
girl
who
wanted
to
fly
into
the
sky
everyone
must
know
me
so
that
my
life
is
not
only
for
myself
so
that
they
dont
live
like
that
girl
independently
of
my
life
but
so
that
it
is
reflected
in
everyone
and
they
all
live
together
with
me
having
returned
from
this
trip
prince
andrei
decided
to
go
to
petersburg
in
the
fall
and
thought
up
various
reasons
for
this
decision
a
whole
series
of
reasonable
logical
arguments
for
why
it
was
necessary
that
he
go
to
petersburg
and
even
serve
was
at
his
disposal
every
moment
he
did
not
even
understand
now
how
he
could
ever
have
doubted
the
necessity
of
taking
an
active
life
just
as
a
month
earlier
he
had
not
understood
how
it
could
ever
occur
to
him
to
leave
the
country
it
seemed
clear
to
him
that
all
his
experience
of
life
must
go
for
naught
and
be
meaningless
if
he
did
not
put
it
to
work
and
again
take
an
active
life
he
did
not
even
understand
how
on
the
basis
of
such
poor
rational
arguments
it
could
have
been
obvious
before
that
he
would
humiliate
himself
if
now
after
his
lessons
in
life
he
should
again
believe
in
the
possibility
of
being
useful
and
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
and
love
now
reason
suggested
something
quite
different
after
his
journey
prince
andrei
began
to
be
bored
in
the
country
his
former
occupations
did
not
interest
him
and
often
sitting
alone
in
his
study
he
would
get
up
go
to
the
mirror
and
look
at
his
face
for
a
long
time
then
he
would
turn
away
and
look
at
the
portrait
of
the
late
liza
who
with
her
hair
curled
224
la
grecque
looked
at
him
tenderly
and
cheerfully
from
the
gilt
frame
she
no
longer
said
terrible
words
to
her
husband
as
before
she
looked
at
him
simply
and
cheerfully
with
curiosity
and
prince
andrei
putting
his
hands
behind
his
back
would
pace
the
room
for
a
long
time
now
frowning
now
smiling
thinking
over
those
irrational
thoughts
inexpressible
in
words
secret
as
a
crime
that
were
connected
with
pierre
with
glory
with
the
girl
on
the
windowsill
with
the
oak
with
feminine
beauty
and
love
which
had
changed
his
whole
life
in
those
moments
if
anyone
came
into
his
room
he
was
particularly
dry
stern
resolute
and
in
particular
unpleasantly
logical
mon
cher
princess
marya
would
say
coming
in
at
such
a
moment
nikolushka
musnt
go
for
a
walk
today
its
too
cold
if
it
were
warm
prince
andrei
would
answer
his
sister
with
particular
dryness
at
such
a
moment
he
would
go
only
in
his
shirt
but
since
its
cold
you
must
put
warm
clothes
on
him
which
is
why
they
were
inventedthats
what
follows
from
the
fact
that
it
is
cold
and
not
that
the
child
should
stay
at
home
when
he
needs
air
he
would
say
with
particular
logicality
as
if
punishing
someone
for
all
that
secret
illogical
work
that
was
going
on
inside
him
on
these
occasions
princess
marya
reflected
on
how
such
mental
work
dries
men
up
iv
prince
andrei
arrived
in
petersburg
in
august
1809
this
was
the
time
when
the
glory
of
the
young
speransky
and
the
energy
of
the
reforms
he
carried
through
were
at
their
apogee
that
same
august
the
sovereign
was
overturned
while
driving
in
his
carriage
injured
his
leg
and
stayed
in
peterhof
for
three
weeks
seeing
speransky
daily
and
exclusively
this
was
the
time
of
the
preparation
not
only
of
the
two
famous
decrees
which
so
alarmed
society
on
the
abolition
of
court
ranks
and
on
examinations
for
the
ranks
of
collegiate
assessor
and
state
councillor
but
also
of
an
entire
state
constitution
which
was
supposed
to
change
the
existing
judicial
administrative
and
financial
order
of
management
in
russia
from
the
council
of
state
to
the
local
board
now
came
the
realization
and
embodiment
of
those
vague
liberal
dreams
with
which
alexander
had
taken
the
throne
and
which
he
had
been
striving
to
realize
with
the
aid
of
his
helpers
czartoryski
novosiltsev
kochubey
and
stroganov
whom
he
himself
jokingly
referred
to
as
his
comit233
de
salut
publique
now
they
had
all
been
replaced
by
speransky
on
the
civil
side
and
arakcheev
on
the
military
soon
after
his
arrival
prince
andrei
being
a
gentleman
of
the
chamber
appeared
at
court
and
at
a
levee
the
sovereign
met
him
twice
and
did
not
deign
to
say
even
one
word
to
him
it
had
always
seemed
to
prince
andrei
even
before
that
he
was
antipathetic
for
the
sovereign
that
the
sovereign
disliked
his
face
and
his
whole
being
in
the
dry
distant
gaze
with
which
the
sovereign
looked
at
him
prince
andrei
found
still
more
confirmation
of
this
supposition
than
before
the
courtiers
explained
the
sovereigns
inattention
to
him
by
the
fact
that
his
majesty
was
displeased
that
bolkonsky
had
not
served
since
1805
i
know
myself
how
little
control
we
have
over
our
sympathies
and
antipathies
thought
prince
andrei
and
therefore
theres
no
use
thinking
of
presenting
my
memorandum
on
military
regulations
to
the
sovereign
personally
but
the
matter
will
speak
for
itself
he
told
an
old
field
marshal
his
fathers
friend
about
his
project
the
field
marshal
appointed
a
time
received
him
benignly
and
promised
to
report
to
the
sovereign
a
few
days
later
prince
andrei
was
told
that
he
had
to
appear
before
the
minister
of
war
count
arakcheev
at
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
appointed
day
prince
andrei
appeared
in
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
prince
andrei
did
not
know
arakcheev
personally
and
had
never
seen
him
but
everything
he
knew
about
him
inspired
little
respect
in
him
for
this
man
he
is
minister
of
war
the
sovereign
emperors
trusted
man
his
personal
qualities
are
nobodys
business
he
was
entrusted
with
considering
my
memorandumconsequently
he
alone
can
set
it
in
motion
thought
prince
andrei
waiting
among
many
significant
and
insignificant
persons
in
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
during
his
service
mostly
as
an
adjutant
prince
andrei
had
seen
many
anterooms
of
significant
persons
and
the
differing
characters
of
these
anterooms
were
very
clear
to
him
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
had
a
completely
special
character
the
insignificant
persons
waiting
in
line
for
an
audience
in
count
arakcheevs
anteroom
had
feelings
of
abashedness
and
submission
written
on
their
faces
the
persons
of
higher
rank
had
faces
expressing
a
general
feeling
of
awkwardness
concealed
behind
an
appearance
of
casualness
and
mockery
of
oneself
of
ones
position
and
of
the
person
they
were
waiting
to
meet
some
paced
up
and
down
pensively
others
whispered
and
laughed
and
prince
andrei
heard
the
sobriquet
sila
andreich
and
the
phrase
uncle
will
give
you
what
for
referring
to
arakcheev
one
general
a
significant
person
apparently
insulted
at
having
to
wait
so
long
sat
crossing
and
recrossing
his
legs
and
smiling
contemptuously
to
himself
but
as
soon
as
the
door
opened
all
the
faces
instantly
expressed
only
one
thingfear
prince
andrei
asked
the
officer
on
duty
to
announce
him
once
more
but
he
was
looked
at
with
mockery
and
told
that
his
turn
would
come
in
due
time
after
several
persons
were
led
into
and
out
of
the
ministers
office
by
the
adjutant
the
fearsome
door
received
an
officer
who
had
struck
prince
andrei
with
his
humiliated
and
frightened
look
the
officers
audience
lasted
a
long
time
suddenly
the
thunder
of
an
unpleasant
voice
was
heard
from
behind
the
door
and
the
officer
emerged
pale
his
lips
trembling
and
clutching
his
head
passed
through
the
anteroom
after
that
prince
andrei
was
led
to
the
door
and
the
officer
on
duty
said
in
a
whisper
to
the
right
by
the
window
prince
andrei
entered
a
tidy
unostentatious
office
and
saw
by
the
desk
a
fortyyearold
man
with
a
long
waist
a
long
closecropped
head
and
thick
wrinkles
with
scowling
brows
over
dull
hazelgreen
eyes
and
a
drooping
red
nose
arakcheev
turned
his
head
towards
him
without
looking
at
him
whats
your
petition
asked
arakcheev
i
am
notpetitioning
for
anything
your
excellency
prince
andrei
said
softly
arakcheevs
eyes
turned
towards
him
sit
down
said
arakcheev
prince
bolkonsky
i
am
not
petitioning
for
anything
but
the
sovereign
emperor
has
deigned
to
pass
on
to
your
excellency
the
memorandum
i
submitted
you
see
my
most
gentle
sir
i
have
read
your
memorandum
arakcheev
interrupted
speaking
only
the
first
words
benignly
again
without
looking
him
in
the
face
and
lapsing
more
and
more
into
a
grumblingly
contemptuous
tone
proposing
new
military
regulations
there
are
many
regulations
and
no
one
to
carry
out
the
old
ones
everybody
writes
regulations
these
days
its
easier
to
write
them
than
to
follow
them
i
have
come
by
the
will
of
the
sovereign
emperor
to
learn
from
your
excellency
what
chances
you
intend
to
give
to
the
memorandum
submitted
prince
andrei
said
courteously
i
wrote
a
decision
on
your
memorandum
and
it
was
passed
on
to
the
committee
i
do
not
approve
said
arakcheev
getting
up
and
taking
a
paper
from
his
desk
here
he
handed
it
to
prince
andrei
across
the
paper
was
scrawled
in
pencil
without
capitals
without
orthography
without
punctuation
unsoundly
compiled
since
copied
from
french
military
regulations
and
unnecessarily
deviating
from
military
articles
to
what
committee
has
the
memorandum
been
passed
on
asked
prince
andrei
to
the
commission
on
military
regulations
and
i
have
proposed
that
your
honor
be
enrolled
as
a
member
only
without
salary
prince
andrei
smiled
i
do
not
wish
any
member
without
salary
repeated
arakcheev
my
respects
hey
call
em
in
whos
next
he
shouted
bowing
to
prince
andrei
v
while
waiting
to
hear
about
his
enrollment
as
a
member
of
the
committee
prince
andrei
renewed
old
acquaintances
especially
with
those
persons
whom
he
knew
were
in
power
and
could
be
useful
to
him
he
now
experienced
in
petersburg
a
feeling
similar
to
what
he
had
experienced
on
the
eve
of
battle
when
he
had
fretted
with
anxious
curiosity
and
was
irresistibly
drawn
to
the
higher
spheres
where
the
future
was
being
prepared
on
which
the
fates
of
millions
depended
he
sensed
by
the
spitefulness
of
the
old
men
by
the
curiosity
of
the
uninitiate
by
the
reserve
of
the
initiate
by
the
haste
and
preoccupation
of
all
by
the
countless
number
of
committees
and
commissionsand
he
learned
of
the
existence
of
new
ones
every
daythat
now
in
the
year
1809
here
in
petersburg
some
enormous
civil
battle
was
being
prepared
of
which
the
commander
in
chief
was
a
mysterious
person
still
unknown
to
him
whom
he
imagined
to
be
a
geniussperansky
and
both
the
matter
of
the
reform
which
he
vaguely
knew
and
speransky
who
was
its
chief
promoter
began
to
interest
him
so
passionately
that
the
matter
of
military
regulations
was
very
soon
shifted
to
a
secondary
place
in
his
consciousness
prince
andrei
occupied
one
of
the
most
advantageous
positions
for
being
well
received
in
all
the
highest
and
most
diverse
circles
of
petersburg
society
at
that
time
the
party
of
the
reformers
cordially
welcomed
and
courted
him
first
because
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
intelligent
and
wellread
and
second
because
by
granting
freedom
to
his
peasants
he
had
already
earned
himself
a
reputation
as
a
liberal
the
party
of
the
disgruntled
old
men
turned
to
him
directly
for
sympathy
as
his
fathers
son
condemning
the
reforms
feminine
society
the
world
welcomed
him
cordially
because
he
was
an
eligible
young
man
rich
and
wellborn
and
almost
a
new
personage
with
the
aura
of
the
romantic
story
of
his
alleged
death
and
his
wifes
tragic
end
besides
that
the
general
opinion
of
him
among
all
who
had
known
him
before
was
that
he
had
changed
greatly
for
the
better
in
those
five
years
had
softened
and
matured
and
there
was
none
of
the
former
affectation
pride
and
mockery
in
him
but
there
was
that
serenity
which
comes
with
age
people
talked
about
him
were
interested
in
him
and
everyone
wished
to
see
him
the
day
after
his
visit
to
count
arakcheev
prince
andrei
went
to
a
soir233e
at
count
kochubeys
he
told
the
count
about
his
meeting
with
sila
andreich
as
kochubey
called
arakcheev
with
that
vague
mockery
of
something
which
prince
andrei
had
noticed
in
the
minister
of
wars
anteroom
mon
cher
said
kochubey
even
in
this
matter
you
cannot
avoid
mikhail
mikhailovich
cest
le
grand
faiseur
ill
tell
him
he
promised
to
come
this
evening
what
concern
does
speransky
have
with
military
regulations
asked
prince
andrei
kochubey
smiled
and
shook
his
head
as
if
surprised
at
bolkonskys
na239vet233
he
and
i
were
talking
about
you
the
other
day
kochubey
went
on
about
your
free
plowmen
ah
so
its
you
prince
who
freed
your
muzhiks
asked
an
old
man
of
catherines
time
glancing
scornfully
at
bolkonsky
its
a
small
estate
that
brought
no
income
replied
bolkonsky
so
as
not
to
vex
the
old
man
for
nothing
and
trying
to
soften
his
act
before
him
vous
craignez
d234tre
en
retard
said
the
old
man
looking
at
kochubey
one
thing
i
dont
understand
the
old
man
went
on
whos
going
to
work
the
land
if
theyre
freed
writing
laws
is
easy
but
governing
is
difficult
its
the
same
thing
i
ask
you
now
count
who
will
be
the
heads
of
departments
if
everybody
has
to
take
examinations
those
who
pass
them
i
suppose
kochubey
replied
crossing
his
legs
and
looking
around
here
ive
got
pryanichnikov
serving
under
me
a
nice
man
good
as
gold
but
hes
sixtyis
he
going
to
take
examinations
yes
that
makes
it
difficult
since
education
is
not
very
widespread
but
count
kochubey
did
not
finish
stood
up
and
taking
prince
andrei
by
the
arm
went
to
meet
a
tall
balding
fairhaired
man
of
about
forty
with
a
large
open
forehead
and
an
elongated
face
of
an
unusual
strange
whiteness
the
entering
man
was
wearing
a
dark
blue
tailcoat
a
cross
on
his
neck
and
a
star
on
the
left
side
of
his
chest
it
was
speransky
prince
andrei
recognized
him
at
once
and
something
in
his
soul
shook
as
happens
at
important
moments
of
life
whether
it
was
respect
envy
or
expectationhe
did
not
know
speranskys
entire
figure
was
of
a
special
type
by
which
he
could
be
recognized
at
once
in
no
one
of
the
society
in
which
prince
andrei
lived
had
he
seen
this
calm
and
selfassurance
of
clumsy
and
obtuse
movements
in
no
one
had
he
seen
such
a
firm
and
at
the
same
time
soft
gaze
of
halfclosed
and
slightly
moist
eyes
such
firmness
of
a
totally
meaningless
smile
such
a
thin
smooth
soft
voice
and
above
all
such
a
tender
whiteness
of
the
face
and
especially
of
the
hands
somewhat
broad
but
extraordinarily
plump
tender
and
white
such
whiteness
and
tenderness
of
face
prince
andrei
had
seen
only
in
soldiers
who
had
spent
a
long
time
in
the
hospital
this
was
speransky
secretary
of
state
counselor
to
the
sovereign
and
his
companion
at
erfurt
where
he
had
seen
and
spoken
with
napoleon
more
than
once
speransky
did
not
shift
his
eyes
from
one
face
to
another
as
one
does
involuntarily
when
entering
a
large
company
and
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
speak
he
spoke
softly
with
assurance
that
he
would
be
heard
and
looked
only
at
the
person
with
whom
he
was
speaking
prince
andrei
followed
every
word
and
movement
of
speransky
with
special
attention
as
happens
with
people
especially
those
who
judge
their
neighbors
severely
prince
andrei
on
meeting
a
new
person
especially
one
whom
like
speransky
he
knew
by
reputation
always
expected
to
find
in
him
the
full
perfection
of
human
virtues
speransky
told
kochubey
that
he
was
sorry
he
could
not
come
earlier
but
he
had
been
detained
in
the
palace
he
did
not
say
he
had
been
detained
by
the
sovereign
and
this
affectation
of
modesty
prince
andrei
noticed
when
kochubey
named
prince
andrei
for
him
speransky
slowly
transferred
his
eyes
to
him
with
the
same
smile
and
silently
began
to
look
at
him
i
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
i
have
heard
about
you
as
everyone
has
he
said
kochubey
said
a
few
words
about
the
reception
arakcheev
had
given
bolkonsky
speranskys
smile
widened
the
director
of
the
commission
on
military
regulations
is
a
good
friend
of
minemr
magnitsky
he
said
articulating
each
syllable
and
each
word
and
if
you
wish
i
could
bring
you
together
with
him
he
paused
at
the
period
i
hope
you
will
find
sympathy
in
him
and
a
desire
to
further
everything
sensible
a
circle
formed
itself
at
once
around
speransky
and
the
old
man
who
had
spoken
of
his
subordinate
pryanichnikov
also
turned
to
speransky
with
a
question
prince
andrei
without
entering
into
the
conversation
observed
all
the
movements
of
speransky
this
man
recently
an
insignificant
seminarian
who
now
held
the
destiny
of
russia
in
his
handsthose
white
plump
handsas
bolkonsky
thought
prince
andrei
was
struck
by
the
extraordinary
scornful
calm
with
which
speransky
answered
the
old
man
he
seemed
to
address
his
condescending
words
to
him
from
an
immeasurable
height
when
the
old
man
began
talking
too
loud
speransky
smiled
and
said
he
could
not
judge
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
what
pleased
the
sovereign
having
talked
for
some
time
in
the
general
circle
speransky
got
up
and
going
over
to
prince
andrei
called
him
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
it
was
clear
that
he
considered
it
necessary
to
concern
himself
with
bolkonsky
i
had
no
time
to
talk
with
you
prince
amidst
the
animated
conversation
i
was
drawn
into
by
that
venerable
elder
he
said
with
a
mildly
scornful
smile
as
if
acknowledging
by
that
smile
that
he
and
prince
andrei
understood
the
insignificance
of
the
people
with
whom
he
had
just
been
talking
this
manner
flattered
prince
andrei
ive
known
you
for
a
long
time
first
from
your
dealing
with
your
peasants
our
first
example
of
which
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
more
followers
and
second
because
you
are
one
of
those
gentlemen
of
the
chamber
who
did
not
consider
themselves
offended
by
the
new
edict
on
court
ranks
which
has
caused
so
much
talk
and
discussion
yes
said
prince
andrei
my
father
didnt
want
me
to
take
advantage
of
that
right
i
started
service
in
the
lower
ranks
your
father
a
man
of
the
old
days
obviously
stands
higher
than
our
contemporaries
who
condemn
this
measure
so
much
though
it
merely
restores
natural
justice
i
think
however
that
there
are
also
grounds
for
these
condemnations
said
prince
andrei
trying
to
fight
against
speranskys
influence
which
he
was
beginning
to
feel
he
disliked
agreeing
with
him
in
everything
he
wanted
to
contradict
prince
andrei
who
usually
spoke
easily
and
well
had
difficulty
expressing
himself
now
in
talking
with
speransky
he
was
too
taken
up
with
observing
the
person
of
the
famous
man
grounds
of
personal
ambition
perhaps
speransky
quietly
put
in
his
word
also
partly
of
the
state
said
prince
andrei
how
do
you
mean
said
speransky
quietly
lowering
his
eyes
i
am
an
admirer
of
montesquieu
said
prince
andrei
and
his
thought
that
le
principe
des
monarchies
est
lhonneur
me
para238t
incontestable
certains
droits
et
privil232ges
de
la
noblesse
me
paraissent
234tre
des
moyens
de
soutenir
ce
sentiment
the
smile
vanished
from
speranksys
white
face
and
his
physiognomy
gained
much
from
it
he
probably
found
prince
andreis
thought
interesting
si
vous
envisager
la
question
sous
ce
point
de
vue
he
began
articulating
in
french
with
obvious
difficulty
and
speaking
still
more
slowly
than
in
russian
but
perfectly
calmly
he
said
that
honor
lhonneur
could
not
be
supported
by
privileges
detrimental
to
the
course
of
government
service
that
honor
lhonneur
was
either
a
negative
notion
of
not
committing
reprehensible
acts
or
a
wellknown
source
of
competition
for
gaining
approval
and
the
rewards
expressive
of
it
his
arguments
were
concise
simple
and
clear
an
institution
supportive
of
this
honor
the
source
of
competition
is
an
institution
like
the
l233gion
dhonneur
of
the
great
emperor
napoleon
which
is
not
detrimental
but
contributes
to
the
success
of
the
service
and
not
the
privilege
of
rank
or
position
at
court
i
dont
argue
but
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
court
privileges
achieve
the
same
goal
said
prince
andrei
every
courtier
considers
it
his
duty
to
uphold
his
position
with
dignity
but
you
did
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
it
prince
said
speransky
showing
by
his
smile
that
he
wished
to
stop
an
argument
awkward
for
his
interlocutor
by
this
compliment
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
joining
me
on
wednesday
he
added
then
once
ive
talked
with
magnitsky
i
will
inform
you
of
something
that
may
interest
you
and
besides
that
i
will
have
the
pleasure
of
a
more
detailed
conversation
with
you
he
closed
his
eyes
bowed
and
224
la
fran231aise
without
saying
goodbye
trying
not
to
be
noticed
left
the
room
vi
during
the
initial
time
of
his
stay
in
petersburg
prince
andrei
felt
that
his
whole
way
of
thinking
developed
in
his
solitary
life
was
completely
overshadowed
by
the
petty
cares
that
consumed
him
in
petersburg
on
coming
home
in
the
evening
he
would
jot
down
in
his
notebook
four
or
five
necessary
visits
or
rendezvous
at
appointed
hours
the
mechanism
of
life
the
ordering
of
the
day
so
as
to
get
everywhere
on
time
took
the
greater
the
very
energy
of
life
he
did
not
do
anything
he
did
not
even
think
about
anything
and
had
no
time
to
think
but
only
talked
and
talked
successfully
about
what
he
had
had
time
to
think
over
previously
in
the
country
he
sometimes
noticed
with
displeasure
that
he
had
happened
to
repeat
the
same
thing
on
the
same
day
in
different
companies
but
he
was
so
busy
for
whole
days
that
he
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
fact
that
he
was
doing
nothing
as
in
his
first
meeting
with
him
at
kochubeys
speransky
also
made
a
strong
impression
on
bolkonsky
that
wednesday
at
home
where
he
received
him
alone
and
talked
with
him
at
length
and
trustfully
prince
andrei
considered
such
a
vast
number
of
people
as
contemptible
and
insignificant
beings
he
wanted
so
much
to
find
in
someone
else
the
living
ideal
of
that
perfection
for
which
he
strove
that
he
easily
believed
that
in
speransky
he
had
found
that
ideal
of
the
fully
reasonable
and
virtuous
man
if
speransky
had
been
from
the
same
society
as
prince
andrei
of
the
same
upbringing
and
moral
habits
bolkonsky
would
soon
have
found
his
weak
human
unheroic
sides
but
as
it
was
this
logical
way
of
thinking
which
was
strange
for
him
inspired
him
with
all
the
more
respect
because
he
did
not
quite
understand
him
besides
that
speransky
either
because
he
appreciated
prince
andreis
ability
or
because
he
found
it
necessary
to
acquire
him
for
himself
flaunted
his
impartial
calm
reason
before
prince
andrei
and
flattered
prince
andrei
with
that
subtle
flattery
combined
with
selfassurance
which
consists
in
silently
acknowledging
ones
interlocutor
and
oneself
as
the
only
people
capable
of
understanding
all
the
stupidity
of
all
the
rest
and
the
intelligence
and
profundity
of
ones
own
thoughts
in
the
course
of
their
long
conversation
on
wednesday
evening
speransky
said
more
than
once
among
us
everything
that
lies
outside
the
general
level
of
inveterate
habit
is
considered
or
with
a
smile
but
we
want
the
wolves
wellfed
and
the
sheep
safe
or
they
cannot
understand
it
and
all
that
with
an
expression
which
said
we
you
and
i
understand
what
they
are
and
who
we
are
this
first
long
conversation
with
speransky
only
strengthened
in
prince
andrei
the
feeling
he
had
had
on
first
seeing
him
he
saw
in
him
a
reasonable
rigorousminded
man
of
immense
intelligence
who
through
his
energy
and
perseverance
had
come
to
power
and
used
it
solely
for
the
good
of
russia
speransky
in
prince
andreis
eyes
was
precisely
that
manexplaining
all
phenomena
of
life
reasonably
accepting
as
real
only
that
which
is
reasonable
and
capable
of
applying
the
standard
of
reasonableness
to
everythingwhom
he
himself
wanted
so
much
to
be
everything
seemed
so
simple
so
clear
in
speranskys
explanations
that
prince
andrei
involuntarily
agreed
with
him
in
everything
if
he
protested
and
argued
it
was
only
because
he
purposely
wanted
to
be
independent
and
not
to
yield
entirely
to
speranskys
opinions
everything
was
right
everything
was
very
well
but
one
thing
disconcerted
prince
andrei
it
was
speranskys
cold
mirrorlike
gaze
which
let
no
one
penetrate
to
his
soul
and
his
tender
white
hand
at
which
prince
andrei
stared
involuntarily
as
one
stares
at
the
hands
of
people
who
have
power
the
mirrorlike
gaze
and
that
tender
white
hand
for
some
reason
irritated
prince
andrei
he
was
also
unpleasantly
struck
by
a
toogreat
contempt
for
people
that
he
noticed
in
speransky
and
the
diversity
of
methods
of
proof
he
resorted
to
in
confirming
his
opinions
he
employed
every
possible
intellectual
tool
except
for
analogy
and
seemed
to
pass
too
boldly
from
one
to
another
now
he
would
stand
on
the
practical
activists
ground
and
denounce
dreamers
now
on
the
satirists
ground
and
chuckle
ironically
at
his
adversaries
now
he
would
become
strictly
logical
now
he
would
suddenly
rise
into
the
spheres
of
metaphysics
this
last
instrument
of
proof
he
made
use
of
especially
often
he
would
transfer
the
question
to
metaphysical
heights
go
on
to
definitions
of
space
time
thought
and
deriving
his
refutations
from
there
descend
again
to
the
ground
of
the
argument
in
general
the
main
feature
that
struck
prince
andrei
in
speranskys
mind
was
his
unquestionable
unshakeable
faith
in
the
power
and
legitimacy
of
reason
it
was
clear
that
the
notion
so
usual
for
prince
andrei
that
it
was
after
all
impossible
to
express
everything
one
thinks
would
never
have
entered
speranskys
head
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
isnt
everything
i
think
and
believe
sheer
nonsense
and
that
special
cast
of
speranskys
mind
attracted
prince
andrei
most
of
all
during
the
first
period
of
his
acquaintance
with
speransky
prince
andrei
had
a
passionate
feeling
of
admiration
for
him
resembling
what
he
used
to
feel
for
bonaparte
the
circumstance
that
speransky
was
a
priests
son
whom
stupid
people
could
vulgarly
despise
as
many
did
for
being
a
little
cleric
and
a
preachers
brat
made
prince
andrei
treat
his
feeling
for
speransky
with
special
care
and
unconsciously
strengthen
it
within
himself
on
that
first
evening
which
bolkonsky
spent
with
him
talking
about
the
legislative
commission
speransky
told
prince
andrei
ironically
that
this
commission
had
existed
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
cost
millions
and
had
done
nothing
except
that
rosenkampf
had
glued
little
labels
to
all
the
articles
of
comparative
legislation
and
for
that
alone
the
state
has
paid
millions
he
said
we
want
to
give
new
judicial
powers
to
the
senate
but
we
have
no
laws
which
is
why
its
a
sin
prince
for
people
such
as
you
not
to
serve
now
prince
andrei
said
that
for
that
he
needed
a
legal
education
which
he
did
not
have
but
no
one
has
so
what
do
you
want
its
a
circulus
viciosus
which
we
must
make
an
effort
to
break
out
of
a
week
later
prince
andrei
was
a
member
of
the
commission
on
military
regulations
and
something
he
had
never
expected
head
of
a
section
of
the
legislative
commission
at
speranskys
request
he
took
the
first
the
civil
code
then
in
the
process
of
being
developed
and
with
the
help
of
the
code
napol233on
and
the
justiniani
worked
on
putting
together
the
section
headed
personal
rights
vii
some
two
years
before
then
in
1808
having
returned
to
petersburg
from
his
trip
to
his
estates
pierre
involuntarily
became
the
head
of
the
petersburg
masons
he
organized
dinners
and
funerals
for
the
lodges
recruited
new
members
saw
to
the
uniting
of
various
lodges
and
the
acquiring
of
authentic
charters
he
donated
his
own
money
for
the
setting
up
of
temples
and
made
up
as
far
as
he
could
for
the
shortfall
in
the
collection
of
alms
in
which
the
majority
of
members
were
stingy
and
irregular
almost
alone
on
his
own
means
he
supported
a
poorhouse
set
up
by
the
order
in
petersburg
his
life
meanwhile
went
on
in
the
same
way
with
the
same
diversions
and
licentiousness
he
liked
to
dine
and
drink
well
and
though
he
considered
it
immoral
and
humiliating
he
could
not
refrain
from
the
amusements
of
the
bachelor
companies
he
participated
in
in
the
daze
of
his
activities
and
diversions
however
pierre
began
to
feel
after
a
year
that
the
ground
of
masonry
on
which
he
stood
was
giving
way
all
the
more
under
his
feet
the
more
firmly
he
tried
to
stand
on
it
along
with
that
he
felt
that
the
further
the
ground
he
stood
on
gave
way
under
his
feet
the
more
involuntarily
he
was
bound
to
it
when
he
was
starting
out
in
masonry
he
experienced
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
trustingly
sets
foot
on
the
smooth
surface
of
a
swamp
placing
one
foot
on
it
he
sank
to
verify
fully
the
firmness
of
the
ground
on
which
he
stood
he
placed
the
other
foot
on
it
and
sank
still
more
became
stuck
and
now
involuntarily
walked
kneedeep
through
the
swamp
iosif
alexeevich
was
not
in
petersburg
he
had
recently
withdrawn
from
the
activity
of
the
petersburg
lodges
and
was
living
permanently
in
moscow
all
the
brothers
the
members
of
the
lodges
were
people
whom
pierre
knew
in
life
and
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
see
in
them
only
brothers
in
freemasonry
and
not
prince
b
not
ivan
vassilievich
d
whom
he
knew
in
life
mainly
as
weak
and
insignificant
people
under
the
masonic
aprons
and
signs
he
saw
on
them
the
uniforms
and
decorations
they
strove
for
in
life
often
collecting
alms
and
counting
up
twenty
or
thirty
roubles
written
down
as
receipts
and
for
the
most
owing
from
ten
members
half
of
whom
were
as
rich
as
he
was
pierre
remembered
the
masonic
vow
in
which
each
brother
promised
to
give
all
his
possessions
to
his
neighbor
and
doubts
arose
in
his
soul
which
he
tried
not
to
dwell
on
he
divided
all
the
brothers
he
knew
into
four
categories
in
the
first
category
he
included
brothers
who
took
no
active
in
the
affairs
of
the
lodges
or
in
the
affairs
of
the
people
but
were
taken
up
exclusively
with
the
mysteries
of
the
orders
science
with
questions
of
the
triple
name
of
god
or
of
the
three
basic
elements
of
thingssulfur
mercury
and
salt
or
with
the
meaning
of
the
square
and
all
the
figures
on
solomons
temple
pierre
respected
this
category
of
brother
masons
to
which
mainly
the
old
brothers
and
iosif
alexeevich
himself
belonged
in
pierres
opinion
but
he
did
not
share
their
interests
his
heart
was
not
inclined
to
the
mystical
side
of
masonry
in
the
second
category
pierre
included
himself
and
similar
brothers
seeking
vacillating
who
had
not
yet
found
in
masonry
a
straight
and
clear
path
but
hoped
to
find
one
in
the
third
category
he
included
the
brothers
they
were
the
majority
who
saw
nothing
in
masonry
except
external
form
and
ritual
and
who
valued
the
strict
observance
of
this
external
form
with
no
concern
for
its
content
and
meaning
such
were
willarski
and
even
the
grand
master
of
the
main
lodge
in
the
fourth
category
finally
there
were
also
a
great
many
brothers
especially
those
who
had
entered
the
brotherhood
recently
these
were
people
who
from
pierres
observation
did
not
believe
in
anything
did
not
desire
anything
and
joined
the
masons
only
to
be
close
to
the
rich
young
brothers
powerful
through
their
connections
and
nobility
of
whom
there
were
many
in
the
lodge
pierre
was
beginning
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
his
activity
masonry
at
least
the
masonry
he
knew
here
sometimes
seemed
to
him
to
be
based
on
appearance
alone
he
never
thought
of
doubting
masonry
itself
but
he
suspected
that
russian
masonry
had
taken
the
wrong
path
and
deviated
from
its
source
and
therefore
at
the
end
of
the
year
pierre
went
abroad
to
be
initiated
into
the
highest
mysteries
of
the
order
in
the
summer
of
1809
pierre
returned
to
petersburg
from
the
correspondence
of
our
masons
with
those
abroad
it
was
known
that
bezukhov
had
managed
while
abroad
to
gain
the
confidence
of
many
highly
placed
persons
had
penetrated
many
mysteries
had
been
raised
to
a
higher
degree
and
was
bringing
much
back
with
him
for
the
common
good
of
the
freemasons
cause
in
russia
all
the
petersburg
masons
came
to
him
fawned
on
him
and
it
seemed
to
them
all
that
he
was
concealing
and
preparing
something
a
solemn
session
of
the
lodge
of
the
second
degree
was
convened
at
which
pierre
promised
to
tell
what
he
had
to
convey
to
the
petersburg
brothers
from
the
highest
leaders
of
the
order
the
session
was
full
after
the
usual
rituals
pierre
got
up
and
began
his
speech
beloved
brothers
he
began
blushing
and
faltering
and
holding
the
written
text
in
his
hand
it
is
not
enough
to
observe
our
mysteries
in
the
quiet
of
the
lodgewe
must
actact
we
are
somnolent
but
we
must
act
pierre
took
out
his
notebook
and
began
to
read
in
order
to
spread
the
pure
truth
and
bring
about
the
triumph
of
virtue
he
read
we
must
purify
people
of
prejudice
spread
rules
that
correspond
to
the
spirit
of
the
time
take
upon
ourselves
the
upbringing
of
the
young
unite
the
most
intelligent
people
with
indissoluble
bonds
boldly
and
yet
reasonably
overcome
superstition
unbelief
and
stupidity
and
form
those
devoted
to
us
into
people
bound
together
by
a
single
goal
and
having
power
and
strength
for
the
achievement
of
this
goal
we
must
assure
a
preponderance
of
virtue
over
vice
we
must
try
to
make
it
so
that
the
honest
man
already
attains
in
this
world
the
eternal
reward
for
his
virtues
but
we
are
very
much
hindered
in
these
great
intentions
by
presentday
political
institutions
what
are
we
to
do
in
such
a
state
of
affairs
are
we
to
favor
revolutions
overthrow
everything
drive
out
force
by
forceno
we
are
very
far
from
that
every
violent
reform
is
blameworthy
because
it
will
not
set
evil
to
rights
in
the
least
as
long
as
people
remain
as
they
are
and
because
wisdom
has
no
need
of
violence
the
entire
project
of
the
order
should
be
based
on
forming
people
who
are
firm
virtuous
and
bound
together
by
unity
of
conviction
a
conviction
that
consists
of
persecuting
vice
and
stupidity
everywhere
and
with
all
their
might
and
of
patronizing
talent
and
virtue
drawing
worthy
people
up
from
the
dust
and
uniting
them
to
our
brotherhood
only
then
will
our
order
have
powerto
bind
imperceptibly
the
hands
of
those
who
condone
disorder
and
rule
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
do
not
notice
it
in
short
a
universal
sovereign
form
of
government
should
be
established
which
will
be
spread
over
the
whole
world
without
destroying
civil
bonds
and
under
which
all
other
governments
may
continue
in
their
usual
way
and
do
all
except
that
which
hinders
the
great
goal
of
our
order
that
is
the
achievement
of
the
triumph
of
virtue
over
vice
this
was
the
goal
of
christianity
itself
it
taught
people
to
be
wise
and
kind
and
to
follow
for
their
own
benefit
the
example
and
precepts
of
the
best
and
wisest
men
back
then
when
all
was
plunged
in
darkness
preaching
alone
was
of
course
sufficient
the
newness
of
the
truth
endowed
it
with
special
strength
but
now
we
require
much
stronger
means
it
is
now
necessary
that
men
governed
by
their
own
feelings
find
sensual
delight
in
virtue
it
is
impossible
to
eradicate
the
passions
we
must
only
try
to
point
them
towards
a
noble
goal
and
therefore
it
is
necessary
that
every
man
be
able
to
satisfy
his
passions
within
the
limits
of
virtue
and
that
our
order
provide
the
means
for
it
as
soon
as
we
have
a
certain
number
of
worthy
people
in
every
state
each
of
them
will
in
turn
form
two
more
and
they
will
all
be
closely
united
with
each
otherthen
everything
will
be
possible
for
the
order
which
has
already
secretly
succeeded
in
doing
much
for
the
good
of
mankind
this
speech
produced
not
only
a
strong
impression
but
also
agitation
in
the
lodge
the
majority
of
the
brothers
who
saw
the
dangerous
designs
of
illuminism
in
the
speech
received
it
with
a
coldness
that
surprised
pierre
the
grand
master
began
to
object
to
pierre
pierre
started
developing
his
thoughts
more
and
more
ardently
it
was
long
since
they
had
had
such
a
stormy
session
parties
formed
some
accused
pierre
condemning
him
for
illuminism
others
supported
him
pierre
was
struck
for
the
first
time
at
this
meeting
by
the
infinite
diversity
of
human
minds
which
makes
it
so
that
no
truth
presents
itself
to
two
people
in
the
same
way
even
those
members
who
seemed
to
be
on
his
side
understood
him
in
their
own
fashion
with
limitations
and
alterations
which
pierre
could
not
agree
to
since
his
main
need
consisted
precisely
in
conveying
his
thought
to
others
exactly
as
he
understood
it
himself
at
the
end
of
the
session
the
grand
master
reprimanded
bezukhov
with
ill
will
and
irony
for
his
hotheadedness
saying
that
it
was
not
love
of
virtue
alone
but
also
a
passion
for
struggle
that
had
guided
him
in
his
argument
pierre
did
not
reply
to
him
and
asked
curtly
whether
his
suggestion
would
be
accepted
or
not
he
was
told
that
it
would
not
be
and
pierre
without
waiting
for
the
usual
formalities
left
the
lodge
and
went
home
viii
pierre
was
again
overcome
by
that
anguish
he
feared
so
much
for
three
days
after
delivering
his
speech
at
the
lodge
he
lay
at
home
on
the
sofa
receiving
no
one
and
going
nowhere
during
that
time
a
letter
came
from
his
wife
who
begged
him
to
agree
to
see
her
wrote
of
her
sadness
without
him
and
of
her
wish
to
devote
her
whole
life
to
him
at
the
end
of
her
letter
she
informed
him
that
in
a
few
days
she
would
be
arriving
in
petersburg
from
abroad
following
the
letter
one
of
the
brother
masons
he
respected
less
than
the
others
broke
in
upon
pierres
solitude
and
turning
the
conversation
to
pierres
marital
relations
in
the
guise
of
brotherly
advice
came
out
with
the
thought
that
his
severity
towards
his
wife
was
unjust
and
that
pierre
was
departing
from
the
primary
rules
of
masonry
in
not
forgiving
the
penitent
at
the
same
time
his
motherinlaw
prince
vassilys
wife
sent
for
him
begging
him
to
visit
her
at
least
for
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
a
very
important
matter
pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
that
they
wanted
to
reunite
him
with
his
wife
and
the
idea
was
even
not
unpleasant
for
him
in
the
state
he
was
in
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
pierre
considered
nothing
in
his
life
to
be
of
great
importance
and
under
the
influence
of
the
anguish
that
now
possessed
him
he
valued
neither
his
freedom
nor
his
persistence
in
punishing
his
wife
no
one
is
right
no
one
is
wrong
so
shes
not
wrong
either
he
thought
if
pierre
did
not
consent
at
once
to
a
reunion
with
his
wife
it
was
only
because
being
in
a
state
of
anguish
he
was
not
able
to
undertake
anything
if
his
wife
had
come
to
him
he
would
not
have
sent
her
away
was
it
not
all
the
same
compared
to
what
preoccupied
pierre
whether
he
lived
or
did
not
live
with
his
wife
without
replying
either
to
his
wife
or
to
his
motherinlaw
pierre
got
ready
for
the
road
late
one
night
and
left
for
moscow
to
see
iosif
alexeevich
here
is
what
pierre
wrote
in
his
diary
moscow
17
november
just
back
from
my
benefactor
and
hasten
to
write
down
everything
i
experienced
iosif
alexeevich
lives
in
poverty
and
has
been
suffering
for
three
years
from
a
painful
bladder
ailment
no
one
has
ever
heard
a
groan
or
a
word
of
protest
from
him
from
morning
till
late
at
night
except
for
the
times
when
he
eats
the
plainest
food
he
works
at
science
he
received
me
graciously
and
seated
me
by
him
on
the
bed
where
he
lay
i
made
the
sign
of
the
knights
of
the
east
and
of
jerusalem
he
responded
with
the
same
and
asked
me
with
a
meek
smile
what
i
had
learned
and
acquired
in
the
prussian
and
scottish
lodges
i
told
him
everything
as
well
as
i
could
conveyed
the
principles
i
had
suggested
to
our
petersburg
lodge
and
informed
him
of
the
bad
reception
i
had
received
and
of
the
rift
that
had
occurred
between
me
and
the
brothers
iosif
alexeevich
after
quite
a
long
and
thoughtful
silence
explained
to
me
his
view
of
it
all
which
instantly
lit
up
for
me
the
whole
past
and
the
whole
future
path
that
lay
before
me
he
surprised
me
asking
whether
i
remembered
the
triple
goal
of
the
order
1
keeping
and
knowing
the
mystery
2
purifying
and
correcting
oneself
for
the
receiving
of
it
and
3
correcting
the
human
race
through
striving
for
this
purification
which
is
the
chiefest
and
first
goal
of
the
three
of
course
the
purifying
and
correcting
of
oneself
it
is
the
only
goal
we
can
strive
for
regardless
of
all
circumstances
but
at
the
same
time
this
goal
precisely
calls
for
our
greatest
effort
and
therefore
deluded
by
pride
we
neglect
this
goal
and
pursue
either
the
mystery
which
we
are
unworthy
to
partake
of
because
of
our
impurity
or
the
correction
of
the
human
race
while
we
ourselves
are
an
example
of
vileness
and
depravity
illuminism
is
not
a
pure
teaching
precisely
because
it
became
concerned
with
social
activity
and
is
all
filled
with
pride
on
that
basis
iosif
alexeevich
condemned
my
speech
and
my
whole
activity
i
agreed
with
him
in
the
depths
of
my
soul
as
our
conversation
turned
to
my
family
affairs
he
told
me
the
main
duty
of
a
true
mason
as
ive
told
you
consists
in
perfecting
ones
own
self
but
we
often
think
that
by
removing
all
difficulties
from
our
life
we
will
the
sooner
reach
this
goal
on
the
contrary
my
dear
sir
he
said
to
me
only
amidst
the
worlds
troubles
can
we
achieve
the
three
main
goals
1
selfknowledgefor
man
can
only
know
himself
through
comparison
2
perfectionfor
it
is
achieved
only
through
struggle
and
3
achieving
the
main
virtuethe
love
of
death
only
lifes
adversities
can
show
us
its
vanity
and
contribute
to
our
innate
love
of
death
or
rebirth
into
a
new
life
these
words
are
the
more
remarkable
in
that
iosif
alexeevich
despite
his
great
physical
suffering
is
never
burdened
by
life
but
loves
death
for
which
despite
all
the
purity
and
loftiness
of
his
inner
man
he
still
does
not
feel
himself
sufficiently
prepared
then
my
benefactor
fully
explained
to
me
the
meaning
of
the
great
square
of
creation
and
pointed
out
that
the
numbers
three
and
seven
are
the
foundation
of
everything
he
advised
me
not
to
shun
the
company
of
the
petersburg
brothers
and
occupying
only
positions
of
the
second
degree
in
the
lodge
to
try
while
keeping
the
brothers
from
the
passions
of
pride
to
turn
them
to
the
true
path
of
selfknowledge
and
perfection
besides
that
for
me
personally
he
advised
first
of
all
that
i
keep
watch
over
myself
and
with
that
purpose
he
gave
me
a
notebook
the
one
in
which
i
am
writing
and
will
henceforth
write
down
all
my
acts
petersburg
23
november
i
am
living
with
my
wife
again
my
motherinlaw
came
to
me
in
tears
and
said
that
h233l232ne
was
here
and
that
she
begged
me
to
hear
her
out
that
she
was
innocent
that
she
was
unhappy
at
being
abandoned
by
me
and
many
other
things
i
knew
that
if
i
merely
allowed
myself
to
see
her
i
would
no
longer
be
able
to
refuse
her
wish
in
my
doubt
i
did
not
know
whose
help
and
advice
to
resort
to
if
my
benefactor
had
been
here
he
would
have
told
me
i
retreated
to
my
room
reread
my
letters
from
iosif
alexeevich
recalled
my
conversations
with
him
and
concluded
from
it
all
that
i
should
not
refuse
one
who
asks
and
should
offer
a
helping
hand
to
anyone
all
the
more
to
someone
so
bound
to
me
and
that
i
should
bear
my
cross
but
if
i
forgave
her
for
the
sake
of
virtue
then
let
my
union
with
her
have
only
a
spiritual
goal
so
i
decided
and
so
i
wrote
to
iosif
alexeevich
i
told
my
wife
that
i
asked
her
to
forget
all
the
past
asked
her
to
forgive
me
for
whatever
i
might
be
guilty
of
before
her
but
that
i
had
nothing
to
forgive
her
it
gave
me
joy
to
tell
her
that
let
her
not
know
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
see
her
again
i
have
settled
upstairs
in
the
big
house
and
am
experiencing
a
happy
feeling
of
renewal
ix
then
as
always
high
society
assembling
at
court
and
at
large
balls
was
subdivided
into
several
circles
each
having
its
own
nuance
among
them
the
most
extensive
one
was
the
french
circle
of
the
napoleonic
alliancethe
circle
of
count
rumyantsev
and
caulaincourt
in
this
circle
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
places
was
occupied
by
h233l232ne
as
soon
as
she
settled
with
her
husband
in
petersburg
she
was
frequented
by
gentlemen
from
the
french
embassy
and
a
great
number
of
people
known
for
their
intelligence
and
courtesy
who
belonged
to
that
trend
h233l232ne
had
been
in
erfurt
during
the
famous
meeting
of
the
emperors
and
from
there
had
brought
these
connections
with
all
the
noteworthy
napoleonists
of
europe
in
erfurt
she
had
brilliant
success
napoleon
himself
noticing
her
in
the
theater
asked
who
she
was
and
praised
her
beauty
her
success
as
a
beautiful
and
elegant
woman
did
not
surprise
pierre
because
with
the
years
she
had
become
still
more
beautiful
than
before
but
what
did
surprise
him
was
that
in
these
two
years
his
wife
had
succeeded
in
acquiring
a
reputation
dune
femme
charmante
aussi
spirituelle
que
belle
the
famous
prince
de
ligne
wrote
eightpage
letters
to
her
bilibin
saved
up
his
mots
so
as
to
speak
them
for
the
first
time
in
front
of
the
countess
bezukhov
to
be
received
in
the
countess
bezukhovs
salon
was
considered
a
diploma
in
intelligence
young
men
read
books
before
h233l232nes
soir233es
so
as
to
have
something
to
talk
about
in
her
salon
and
embassy
secretaries
and
even
ambassadors
confided
diplomatic
secrets
to
her
so
that
h233l232ne
was
a
power
in
a
certain
sense
pierre
who
knew
that
she
was
very
stupid
sometimes
with
a
strange
feeling
of
perplexity
and
fear
attended
her
soir233es
and
dinners
where
politics
poetry
and
philosophy
were
discussed
at
these
soir233es
he
experienced
a
feeling
similar
to
what
a
conjurer
experiences
expecting
each
time
that
his
trick
will
be
exposed
but
either
because
stupidity
was
precisely
necessary
for
keeping
such
a
salon
or
because
those
who
were
tricked
found
pleasure
in
the
trick
itself
the
trick
was
not
exposed
and
the
reputation
of
elena
vassilievna
bezukhov
as
une
femme
charmante
et
spirituelle
was
so
firmly
established
that
she
could
utter
the
greatest
banalities
and
stupidities
and
still
they
all
admired
her
every
word
and
sought
for
a
deep
meaning
in
them
which
she
herself
never
suspected
pierre
was
precisely
the
husband
necessary
for
this
brilliant
society
woman
he
was
that
absentminded
eccentric
a
grand
seigneur
of
a
husband
who
got
in
nobodys
way
and
not
only
did
not
spoil
the
general
impression
of
high
tone
in
the
drawing
room
but
by
way
of
contrast
to
his
wifes
gracefulness
and
tact
served
as
an
advantageous
backdrop
for
her
as
a
result
of
his
constant
concentrated
occupation
with
nonmaterial
interests
over
those
two
years
and
his
sincere
scorn
of
everything
else
pierre
adopted
in
his
wifes
society
which
did
not
interest
him
that
tone
of
indifference
negligence
and
benevolence
towards
everyone
which
cannot
be
acquired
artificially
and
which
for
that
reason
inspires
an
involuntary
respect
he
came
into
his
wifes
drawing
room
as
into
a
theater
was
acquainted
with
them
all
was
equally
glad
to
see
them
all
and
was
equally
indifferent
to
them
all
occasionally
he
got
into
a
conversation
that
interested
him
and
then
without
considering
whether
les
messieurs
de
lambassade
were
there
or
not
mumbled
his
opinions
which
were
sometimes
completely
out
of
tone
with
the
present
moment
but
the
opinion
about
the
eccentric
husband
de
la
femme
la
plus
distingu233e
de
p233tersbourg
was
so
well
established
that
no
one
took
his
quirks
au
s233rieux
among
the
many
young
men
who
daily
visited
h233l232ne
boris
drubetskoy
already
quite
successful
in
the
service
was
after
h233l232nes
return
from
erfurt
the
most
intimate
person
in
the
bezukhovs
house
h233l232ne
called
him
mon
page
and
treated
him
like
a
child
she
addressed
him
with
the
same
smile
as
she
did
everyone
else
but
sometimes
pierre
found
it
unpleasant
to
see
that
smile
boris
treated
pierre
with
a
special
dignified
and
sad
deference
this
nuance
of
deference
also
troubled
pierre
pierre
had
suffered
so
painfully
three
years
ago
from
the
offense
inflicted
on
him
by
his
wife
that
he
now
protected
himself
from
the
possibility
of
a
similar
offense
first
by
not
being
his
wifes
husband
and
second
by
not
allowing
himself
to
suspect
no
now
that
shes
become
a
basbleu
she
has
forever
renounced
her
former
passions
he
said
to
himself
there
is
no
example
of
a
basbleu
having
passions
of
the
heart
he
repeated
to
himself
a
rule
drawn
from
who
knows
where
and
which
he
undoubtedly
believed
but
strangely
boriss
presence
in
his
wifes
drawing
room
and
he
was
there
almost
all
the
time
affected
pierre
physically
it
bound
all
his
limbs
and
destroyed
the
spontaneity
and
freedom
of
his
movements
such
a
strange
antipathy
thought
pierre
and
before
i
even
liked
him
very
much
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
pierre
was
a
great
lord
the
somewhat
blind
and
ridiculous
husband
of
a
famous
wife
an
intelligent
eccentric
a
donothing
but
one
who
harmed
nobody
a
nice
and
kind
fellow
yet
in
pierres
soul
all
that
time
a
complex
and
difficult
work
of
inner
development
was
taking
place
which
revealed
much
to
him
and
led
him
to
many
spiritual
doubts
and
joys
x
he
continued
his
diary
and
here
is
what
he
wrote
in
it
during
this
time
24
november
got
up
at
eight
oclock
read
the
holy
scriptures
then
went
to
work
on
the
advice
of
his
benefactor

taken
a
post
on
one
of
the
committees
came
home
for
dinner
ate

and

with

and
after

copied
out
passages
for
the
brothers
in
the
evening
went
down
to
the
countess
and
told
a
funny
story
about

only
remembered
that
i
shouldnt
have
done
it
when
everybody
was
laughing
loudly
i
go

and

27
november
woke
up
late
and
before
getting
up
lay
in
bed
for
a
long
time
indulging
in
laziness
my
god
help
me
and
strengthen
me
so
that
i
may
walk
in
thy
paths
read
the
holy
scriptures
but
without
the
proper
feeling
brother
urusov
came
we
talked
about
the
vanity
of
the
world
he
told
me
about
the
sovereigns
new
projects
i
began
to
object
but
remembered
my
rules
and
the
words
of
our
benefactor
that
a
true
mason
ought
to
be
a
zealous
worker
for
the
state
when
his
participation
is
needed
and
a
calm
contemplator
of
that
to
which
he
is
not
called
my
tongue
is
my
enemy
brothers
g
v
and
o
visited
me
there
was
a
preparatory
talk
before
the
reception
of
a
new
brother
they
laid
upon
me
the
duty
of
rhetor
i
feel
myself
weak
and
unworthy
then
we
talked
about
the
explanation
of
the
seven
pillars
and
the
seven
steps
of
the
temple
the
seven
sciences
the
seven
virtues
the
seven
vices
the
seven
gifts
of
the
holy
spirit
brother
o
was
very
eloquent
in
the
evening
the
reception
took
place
the
new
arrangement
of
the
space
contributed
greatly
to
the
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
the
one
received
was
boris
drubetskoy
i
had
nominated
him
and
i
was
the
rhetor
a
strange
feeling
kept
troubling
me
all
the
while
i
was
with
him
in
the
dark
temple
i
found
that
i
had
in
me
a
feeling
of
hatred
for
him
which
i
tried
in
vain
to
overcome
and
therefore
i
would
truly
have
wished
to
save
him
from
evil
and
lead
him
to
the
path
of
truth
but
bad
thoughts
about
him
did
not
leave
me
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
goal
of
his
entering
the
brotherhood
consisted
only
in
his
desire
to
get
close
to
and
find
favor
with
the
people
who
belong
to
our
lodge
besides
the
fact
that
he
asked
several
times
whether
n
and
s
belonged
to
our
lodge
to
which
i
could
not
reply
besides
the
fact
that
from
my
observation
he
is
not
able
to
feel
respect
for
our
holy
order
and
is
too
concerned
and
contented
with
his
external
man
to
wish
for
spiritual
improvement
i
had
no
grounds
for
doubting
him
but
he
seemed
insincere
to
me
and
all
the
while
i
stood
face
to
face
with
him
in
the
dark
temple
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
smiling
contemptuously
at
my
words
and
i
really
wanted
to
prick
his
bare
chest
with
the
sword
i
held
pointed
at
it
i
could
not
be
eloquent
and
could
not
sincerely
inform
the
brothers
and
the
grand
master
of
my
doubts
great
architect
of

me
to
find
the
true
paths

lead
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
the
lie

that
three
pages
were
skipped
in
the
diary
and
then
the
following
was
written

a
prolonged
instructive
conversation
alone
with

advised
me
to

3
december
woke
up
late
read
the
holy
scriptures
but
was
unfeeling
afterwards
went
out
and
paced
the
reception
room
wanted
to
reflect
but
instead
my
imagination
presented
me
with
an
event
that
happened
four
years
ago
mr
dolokhov
meeting
me
in
moscow
after
my
duel
told
me
that
he
hoped
i
was
enjoying
total
inner
peace
despite
the
absence
of
my
spouse
i
made
no
reply
then
but
now
i
recalled
all
the
details
of
this
meeting
and
in
my
mind
said
the
most
spiteful
words
and
caustic
replies
to
him
i
came
to
my
senses
and
abandoned
this
thought
only
when
i
saw
myself
inflamed
with
wrath
but
i
am
insufficiently
repentant
of
it
then
boris
drubetskoy
came
and
began
recounting
various
adventures
but
i
was
displeased
with
his
visit
from
the
moment
he
came
in
and
said
something
contrary
to
him
he
objected
i
flared
up
and
told
him
a
host
of
unpleasant
and
even
rude
things
he
fell
silent
and
i
thought
better
of
it
only
when
it
was
too
late
my
god
im
totally
unable
to
deal
with
him
this
is
caused
by
my
selflove
i
set
myself
above
him
and
therefore
make
myself
much
worse
than
he
for
he
is
indulgent
towards
my
rudeness
but
i
on
the
contrary
am
contemptuous
of
him
my
god
grant
me
to
see
better
my
own
vileness
in
his
presence
and
to
act
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
useful
to
him
as
well
after
dinner
i
fell
asleep
and
as
i
was
falling
asleep
i
clearly
heard
a
voice
say
in
my
left
ear
your
day
i
dreamed
that
i
was
walking
in
the
darkness
and
was
suddenly
surrounded
by
dogs
but
i
walked
on
without
fear
suddenly
one
small
dog
seized
my
left
thigh
with
its
teeth
and
would
not
let
go
i
began
to
strangle
it
with
my
hands
and
i
had
only
just
torn
it
off
when
another
bigger
one
seized
me
by
the
chest
i
tore
that
one
off
but
a
third
still
bigger
began
to
bite
me
i
started
to
lift
it
up
but
the
more
i
lifted
it
the
bigger
and
heavier
it
became
and
suddenly
brother
a
came
and
taking
me
by
the
arm
led
me
with
him
and
brought
me
to
a
building
to
enter
which
one
had
to
pass
over
a
narrow
plank
i
stepped
on
it
and
the
plank
bent
and
fell
and
i
started
climbing
up
a
fence
which
i
could
barely
reach
with
my
hands
with
great
effort
i
dragged
myself
over
it
in
such
a
way
that
my
legs
hung
on
one
side
and
my
body
on
the
other
i
turned
and
saw
that
brother
a
was
standing
on
the
fence
and
pointing
out
to
me
a
big
avenue
and
garden
and
in
the
garden
a
big
and
beautiful
building
i
woke
up
lord
great
architect
of
nature
help
me
to
tear
off
the
dogsmy
passionsand
the
last
of
them
which
combines
in
itself
the
strength
of
all
the
previous
ones
and
help
me
to
enter
that
temple
of
virtue
the
contemplation
of
which
i
attained
to
in
my
dream
7
december
dreamed
that
iosif
alexeich
was
sitting
in
my
house
and
i
was
very
glad
and
wanted
to
make
him
welcome
that
i
was
babbling
incessantly
with
other
people
and
suddenly
remembered
that
he
would
not
like
it
and
i
wanted
to
get
close
to
him
and
embrace
him
but
as
soon
as
i
got
close
to
him
i
saw
that
his
face
was
transfigured
had
become
young
and
he
was
telling
me
something
very
very
softly
about
the
teaching
of
the
order
so
softly
that
i
couldnt
hear
it
that
we
all
left
the
room
and
then
something
complicated
happened
we
were
sitting
or
lying
on
the
floor
he
was
saying
something
to
me
and
i
wanted
to
show
him
my
sensitivity
and
without
listening
to
what
he
said
i
began
to
imagine
to
myself
the
state
of
my
inner
man
and
the
grace
of
god
coming
upon
me
and
tears
came
to
my
eyes
and
i
was
pleased
that
he
noticed
it
but
he
looked
at
me
with
vexation
and
jumped
up
breaking
off
his
conversation
i
grew
timid
and
asked
whether
what
he
was
saying
referred
to
me
but
he
did
not
reply
looked
at
me
gently
and
after
that
we
were
suddenly
in
my
bedroom
where
there
was
a
double
bed
he
lay
on
the
edge
of
it
and
i
as
if
burning
with
the
desire
to
caress
him
lay
beside
him
and
he
asked
me
tell
me
truly
what
is
your
main
predilection
do
you
know
it
i
think
youve
already
found
it
out
embarrassed
by
this
question
i
replied
that
laziness
was
my
main
predilection
he
shook
his
head
mistrustfully
and
still
more
embarrassed
i
replied
that
though
i
was
living
with
my
wife
on
his
advice
i
was
not
a
husband
to
my
wife
to
this
he
objected
that
my
wife
should
not
be
deprived
of
my
caresses
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
this
was
my
duty
but
i
replied
that
i
was
ashamed
of
it
and
suddenly
everything
disappeared
and
i
woke
up
and
found
in
my
thoughts
the
text
of
holy
scripture
and
the
life
was
the
light
of
men
and
the
light
shineth
in
the
darkness
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
not
iosif
alexeevichs
face
had
been
youthful
and
bright
that
day
i
received
a
letter
from
my
benefactor
about
the
duty
of
married
life
9
december
had
a
dream
from
which
i
awakened
with
a
pounding
heart
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
moscow
in
my
own
house
in
the
big
sitting
room
and
iosif
alexeevich
came
out
of
the
drawing
room
that
i
recognized
at
once
that
the
process
of
rebirth
had
already
been
accomplished
with
him
and
i
rushed
to
meet
him
that
i
kissed
him
and
his
hands
and
he
said
have
you
noticed
that
i
now
have
a
different
face
i
looked
at
him
still
holding
him
in
my
embrace
and
saw
that
his
face
was
young
but
there
was
no
hair
on
his
head
and
his
features
were
quite
different
and
that
i
said
to
him
i
would
recognize
you
if
i
met
you
by
chanceand
at
the
same
time
i
thought
was
i
telling
the
truth
and
suddenly
i
saw
that
he
was
lying
there
like
a
dead
body
then
he
gradually
recovered
and
went
with
me
into
a
big
study
holding
a
big
book
written
on
royal
paper
and
i
said
i
wrote
this
and
he
answered
me
by
inclining
his
head
i
opened
the
book
and
there
were
beautiful
pictures
on
all
the
pages
and
i
knew
that
these
pictures
represented
the
amorous
adventures
of
a
soul
with
its
beloved
and
i
saw
on
the
pages
a
beautiful
image
of
a
girl
in
transparent
clothing
and
with
a
transparent
body
flying
up
to
the
clouds
and
i
knew
that
this
girl
was
none
other
than
the
image
of
the
song
of
songs
and
looking
at
these
pictures
i
felt
that
i
was
doing
a
bad
thing
and
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
them
lord
help
me
my
god
if
thy
forsaking
of
me
is
thy
doing
then
thy
will
be
done
but
if
i
myself
am
the
cause
of
it
then
teach
me
what
to
do
i
will
perish
of
my
own
depravity
if
thou
forsakest
me
altogether
xi
the
financial
affairs
of
the
rostovs
did
not
improve
during
the
two
years
they
spent
in
the
country
though
nikolai
rostov
keeping
firmly
to
his
intention
went
on
serving
in
an
obscure
regiment
spending
comparatively
little
money
the
way
of
life
at
otradnoe
was
such
and
mitenka
in
particular
so
conducted
business
that
the
debts
mounted
irresistibly
every
year
the
only
help
the
old
count
could
evidently
envisage
was
government
service
and
he
went
to
petersburg
to
seek
a
post
to
seek
a
post
and
at
the
same
time
as
he
said
to
amuse
the
girls
for
the
last
time
soon
after
the
rostovs
came
to
petersburg
berg
proposed
to
vera
and
his
proposal
was
accepted
despite
the
fact
that
in
moscow
the
rostovs
belonged
to
high
society
without
knowing
or
thinking
what
society
they
belonged
to
in
petersburg
their
society
was
mixed
and
indefinite
in
petersburg
they
were
provincials
to
whom
the
very
people
that
the
rostovs
fed
in
moscow
without
asking
what
society
they
belonged
to
would
not
lower
themselves
in
petersburg
the
rostovs
lived
as
hospitably
as
in
moscow
and
the
most
diverse
people
came
together
at
their
suppers
their
neighbor
in
otradnoe
a
poor
elderly
landowner
with
daughters
and
the
maid
of
honor
peronsky
pierre
bezukhov
and
the
son
of
a
provincial
postmaster
who
served
in
petersburg
among
the
men
who
very
soon
became
familiars
of
the
rostovs
house
in
petersburg
were
boris
pierre
whom
the
old
count
met
in
the
street
and
dragged
home
and
berg
who
spent
whole
days
at
the
rostovs
and
showed
the
eldest
daughter
countess
vera
such
attention
as
can
only
be
shown
by
a
young
man
who
intends
to
propose
not
in
vain
had
berg
displayed
to
everyone
his
right
arm
wounded
at
austerlitz
and
held
his
utterly
useless
sword
in
his
left
hand
he
recounted
the
incident
to
everyone
so
persistently
and
with
such
importance
that
they
all
believed
in
the
expediency
and
merit
of
this
actionand
berg
received
two
decorations
for
austerlitz
he
had
also
managed
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
finnish
war
he
had
picked
up
a
shell
splinter
that
had
killed
an
adjutant
standing
next
to
the
commander
in
chief
and
offered
this
splinter
to
his
superior
just
as
after
austerlitz
he
recounted
this
incident
to
everyone
at
such
length
and
with
such
persistence
that
they
all
also
believed
it
had
to
have
been
doneand
berg
received
two
decorations
for
the
finnish
war
in
1809
he
was
a
beribboned
captain
of
the
guards
and
occupied
some
sort
of
especially
profitable
posts
in
petersburg
though
some
freethinkers
smiled
when
told
of
bergs
virtues
it
was
impossible
not
to
admit
that
berg
was
a
good
brave
officer
highly
regarded
by
his
superiors
and
a
modest
moral
young
man
with
a
brilliant
career
ahead
of
him
and
even
a
solid
position
in
society
four
years
earlier
having
met
a
german
friend
in
the
stalls
of
a
moscow
theater
berg
had
pointed
vera
rostov
out
to
him
and
said
in
german
das
soll
mein
weib
werden
and
from
that
moment
on
had
determined
to
marry
her
now
in
petersburg
having
figured
out
the
rostovs
situation
he
decided
that
the
time
had
come
and
proposed
bergs
proposal
was
received
at
first
with
a
perplexity
unflattering
to
him
at
first
it
seemed
strange
that
the
son
of
an
obscure
livonian
nobleman
should
propose
to
countess
rostov
but
bergs
chief
quality
was
such
na239ve
and
goodnatured
egoism
that
the
rostovs
involuntarily
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
since
he
himself
was
so
firmly
convinced
that
it
would
be
good
and
even
very
good
what
was
more
the
rostovs
affairs
were
in
great
disorder
which
the
suitor
could
not
help
knowing
and
above
all
vera
was
twentyfour
she
had
come
out
everywhere
and
despite
her
being
unquestionably
beautiful
and
sensible
up
to
then
no
one
had
ever
proposed
to
her
the
proposal
was
accepted
so
you
see
berg
said
to
his
comrade
whom
he
called
his
friend
only
because
he
knew
that
all
people
had
friends
you
see
i
figured
it
all
out
and
i
wouldnt
be
getting
married
if
i
hadnt
thought
it
all
over
and
if
it
were
awkward
for
some
reason
but
now
on
the
contrary
my
papa
and
mama
are
provided
for
ive
arranged
that
lease
for
them
in
the
ostzee
region
and
i
can
live
with
my
wife
in
petersburg
on
my
salary
her
fortune
and
my
carefulness
we
can
get
along
quite
well
im
not
marrying
for
money
i
consider
that
ignoble
but
a
wife
ought
to
bring
in
hers
and
a
husband
his
i
have
my
service
she
has
her
connections
and
some
small
means
in
our
time
that
means
something
doesnt
it
and
above
all
shes
an
excellent
respectable
girl
and
she
loves
me
berg
blushed
and
smiled
and
i
love
her
because
she
has
a
sensible
charactera
very
good
one
take
the
other
sistersame
family
but
something
quite
different
an
unpleasant
character
and
none
of
that
intelligence
and
all
that
you
knowits
unpleasantbut
my
fianc233eyou
must
come
to
berg
went
on
he
was
about
to
say
to
dinner
but
changed
his
mind
and
said
to
tea
and
with
a
quick
movement
of
his
tongue
let
out
a
small
round
smoke
ring
that
fully
embodied
his
dreams
of
happiness
after
the
first
feeling
of
perplexity
that
bergs
proposal
aroused
in
the
parents
the
festivity
and
joy
usual
on
such
occasions
installed
themselves
in
the
family
yet
the
joy
was
not
sincere
but
external
in
the
feelings
of
the
family
regarding
this
marriage
confusion
and
abashedness
could
be
noticed
it
was
as
if
they
were
ashamed
that
they
loved
vera
so
little
and
were
now
so
eager
to
get
her
off
their
hands
the
old
count
was
the
most
embarrassed
of
all
he
probably
would
have
been
unable
to
give
a
name
to
the
cause
of
his
embarrassment
but
that
cause
was
his
financial
affairs
he
decidedly
did
not
know
what
he
had
how
far
in
debt
he
was
and
what
he
would
be
able
to
give
vera
as
a
dowry
when
the
daughters
were
born
each
was
assigned
three
hundred
souls
as
a
dowry
but
one
of
the
estates
had
already
been
sold
another
had
been
mortgaged
and
was
so
long
overdue
that
it
had
to
be
sold
therefore
it
was
impossible
to
give
her
an
estate
there
was
no
money
either
berg
had
been
a
fianc233
for
over
a
month
and
only
a
week
remained
before
the
wedding
but
the
count
still
had
not
resolved
the
question
of
the
dowry
for
himself
and
had
not
discussed
it
with
his
wife
first
the
count
wanted
to
allot
vera
the
ryazan
estate
then
to
sell
some
woodlands
then
to
borrow
money
on
a
promissory
note
several
days
before
the
wedding
berg
came
into
the
counts
study
early
in
the
morning
and
with
a
pleasant
smile
respectfully
asked
his
future
fatherinlaw
to
tell
him
what
countess
veras
dowry
would
be
this
longanticipated
question
embarrassed
the
count
so
much
that
he
unthinkingly
said
the
first
thing
that
came
to
his
head
i
like
that
youre
concerned
about
it
i
like
it
youll
be
satisfied
and
patting
berg
on
the
shoulder
he
got
up
wishing
to
end
the
conversation
but
berg
smiling
pleasantly
explained
that
unless
he
knew
for
certain
what
veras
dowry
would
be
and
received
at
least
what
was
allotted
her
in
advance
he
would
be
forced
to
renounce
because
consider
count
if
i
were
to
allow
myself
to
marry
now
not
having
definite
means
of
supporting
my
wife
i
would
be
acting
basely
the
conversation
ended
with
the
count
who
wished
to
be
magnanimous
and
not
be
subjected
to
new
requests
saying
he
would
give
him
a
promissory
note
for
eighty
thousand
berg
smiled
meekly
kissed
the
count
on
the
shoulder
and
said
that
he
was
very
grateful
but
that
he
was
quite
unable
to
settle
into
the
new
life
now
without
receiving
thirty
thousand
in
cash
or
at
least
twenty
thousand
count
he
added
and
then
a
promissory
note
for
only
sixty
thousand
yes
yes
all
right
the
count
said
quickly
only
excuse
me
my
friend
ill
give
you
twenty
thousand
and
a
promissory
note
for
eighty
thousand
besides
so
there
kiss
me
xii
natasha
was
sixteen
and
it
was
the
year
1809
the
same
she
had
counted
up
to
on
her
fingers
with
boris
four
years
ago
after
they
had
kissed
since
then
she
had
not
seen
boris
once
to
sonya
and
her
mother
when
the
conversation
turned
to
boris
she
said
quite
freely
as
a
decided
thing
that
all
that
had
gone
before
was
childishness
not
worth
talking
about
and
long
forgotten
but
in
the
most
secret
depths
of
her
soul
the
question
whether
her
engagement
to
boris
was
a
joke
or
an
important
binding
promise
tormented
her
since
boris
left
moscow
for
the
army
in
1805
he
had
not
seen
the
rostovs
he
had
visited
moscow
several
times
had
passed
by
not
far
from
otradnoe
but
had
never
once
been
to
the
rostovs
it
sometimes
occurred
to
natasha
that
he
did
not
want
to
see
her
and
these
surmises
were
confirmed
by
the
sad
tone
in
which
the
older
people
spoke
of
him
nowadays
people
dont
remember
old
friends
the
countess
used
to
say
when
boris
was
mentioned
anna
mikhailovna
who
had
visited
the
rostovs
less
often
of
late
also
behaved
with
some
special
dignity
and
each
time
spoke
rapturously
and
gratefully
of
her
sons
merits
and
of
the
brilliant
career
he
had
entered
upon
when
the
rostovs
came
to
petersburg
boris
came
to
visit
them
he
went
to
them
not
without
emotion
the
remembrance
of
natasha
was
boriss
most
poetic
remembrance
but
at
the
same
time
he
went
with
the
firm
intention
of
letting
her
and
her
family
feel
clearly
that
the
childhood
relations
between
himself
and
natasha
could
not
be
binding
either
on
her
or
on
him
he
had
a
brilliant
position
in
society
owing
to
his
intimacy
with
the
countess
bezukhov
a
brilliant
position
in
the
service
owing
to
the
patronage
of
an
important
person
whose
confidence
he
fully
enjoyed
and
he
had
a
nascent
project
of
marrying
one
of
the
richest
eligible
girls
in
petersburg
which
could
very
easily
be
realized
when
boris
entered
the
rostovs
drawing
room
natasha
was
in
her
room
learning
of
his
arrival
she
blushed
and
almost
ran
into
the
drawing
room
beaming
with
a
more
than
affectionate
smile
boris
remembered
the
natasha
of
four
years
ago
in
a
short
dress
with
dark
eyes
shining
from
under
her
curls
and
a
desperate
childish
laugh
and
therefore
when
quite
a
different
natasha
came
in
he
became
embarrassed
and
his
face
showed
a
delighted
surprise
natasha
was
glad
of
that
expression
on
his
face
well
do
you
recognize
your
old
mischievous
friend
asked
the
countess
boris
kissed
natashas
hand
and
said
he
was
surprised
at
the
change
in
her
how
pretty
youve
grown
what
else
natashas
shining
eyes
replied
and
has
papa
aged
she
asked
natasha
sat
down
and
without
entering
into
the
conversation
between
boris
and
the
countess
silently
studied
her
childhood
wooer
in
the
minutest
detail
he
felt
the
weight
of
that
persistent
and
affectionate
gaze
upon
him
and
glanced
at
her
from
time
to
time
boriss
uniform
spurs
tie
haircutall
this
was
of
the
most
fashionable
and
comme
il
faut
natasha
noticed
it
at
once
he
sat
slightly
sideways
on
the
armchair
next
to
the
countess
smoothing
with
his
right
hand
the
cleanest
of
molded
gloves
on
the
left
spoke
with
an
especially
refined
pursing
of
the
lips
about
the
amusements
of
petersburg
high
society
and
with
mild
mockery
recalled
the
old
times
in
moscow
and
moscow
acquaintances
it
was
not
by
chance
as
natasha
could
feel
that
in
naming
the
high
aristocracy
he
mentioned
a
ball
he
had
attended
at
the
ambassadors
and
invitations
from
n
n
and
s
s
natasha
sat
silently
all
the
while
gazing
at
him
from
under
her
brows
this
gaze
disturbed
and
embarrassed
boris
more
and
more
he
interrupted
his
conversation
and
turned
to
look
at
natasha
more
frequently
he
stayed
for
no
more
than
ten
minutes
and
got
up
bowing
his
way
out
the
same
curious
defiant
and
somewhat
mocking
eyes
were
looking
at
him
after
his
first
visit
boris
said
to
himself
that
he
found
natasha
as
attractive
as
ever
but
that
he
was
not
going
to
give
in
to
that
feeling
because
to
marry
hera
girl
with
almost
no
fortunewould
be
to
ruin
his
career
and
to
renew
their
former
relations
without
aiming
at
marriage
would
be
an
ignoble
thing
to
do
boris
decided
in
himself
to
avoid
meeting
natasha
but
despite
that
decision
came
a
few
days
later
and
began
to
visit
often
and
spend
whole
days
at
the
rostovs
he
fancied
he
had
to
have
a
talk
with
natasha
to
tell
her
that
all
the
old
things
must
be
forgotten
that
despite
allshe
could
not
be
his
wife
that
he
had
no
fortune
and
she
would
never
be
allowed
to
marry
him
but
he
kept
failing
and
felt
awkward
about
starting
this
talk
he
became
more
and
more
entangled
every
day
natasha
in
her
mothers
and
sonyas
observation
seemed
to
be
as
in
love
with
boris
as
before
she
sang
his
favorite
songs
for
him
showed
him
her
album
made
him
write
in
it
and
did
not
allow
him
to
talk
about
old
things
giving
him
to
understand
how
beautiful
the
new
things
were
and
every
day
he
left
in
a
fog
without
having
said
what
he
meant
to
say
not
knowing
himself
what
he
was
doing
or
why
he
came
or
how
it
would
end
boris
stopped
frequenting
h233l232ne
received
reproachful
notes
from
her
and
even
so
spent
whole
days
at
the
rostovs
xiii
one
evening
when
the
old
countess
sighing
and
groaning
in
nightcap
and
bed
jacket
without
false
curls
and
with
one
poor
little
knot
of
hair
sticking
out
from
under
the
white
cotton
cap
was
bowing
to
the
ground
on
the
rug
as
she
said
her
evening
prayers
her
door
creaked
and
natasha
came
running
in
her
bare
feet
in
slippers
also
in
her
bed
jacket
and
her
hair
in
curling
papers
the
countess
looked
at
her
and
frowned
she
was
just
finishing
the
last
prayer
will
this
couch
be
my
grave
her
prayerful
mood
was
destroyed
natasha
red
animated
seeing
her
mother
praying
suddenly
stopped
running
crouched
down
and
involuntarily
stuck
out
her
tongue
chiding
herself
seeing
that
her
mother
went
on
praying
she
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
bed
quickly
rubbed
one
small
foot
against
the
other
shaking
off
her
slippers
and
jumped
onto
the
couch
which
the
old
countess
feared
might
become
her
grave
this
couch
was
high
with
a
featherbed
and
five
pillows
each
smaller
than
the
last
natasha
jumped
up
sank
into
the
featherbed
rolled
over
to
the
wall
and
began
fidgeting
under
the
blanket
settling
herself
bending
her
knees
towards
her
chin
kicking
her
feet
and
laughing
barely
audibly
now
covering
her
head
now
peeking
out
to
look
at
her
mother
the
countess
finished
her
prayer
and
went
to
the
bed
with
a
stern
look
but
seeing
that
natasha
had
pulled
the
covers
over
her
head
she
smiled
her
kind
weak
smile
well
well
well
said
the
mother
mama
can
we
talk
say
yes
said
natasha
well
so
one
kiss
here
another
and
thats
it
and
she
embraced
her
mothers
neck
and
kissed
her
under
the
chin
there
was
an
outward
crudeness
in
natashas
treatment
of
her
mother
but
she
was
so
sensitive
and
adroit
that
no
matter
how
she
embraced
her
mother
she
was
always
able
to
do
it
so
that
it
was
neither
painful
nor
unpleasant
nor
awkward
for
her
well
what
is
it
tonight
asked
her
mother
settling
on
the
pillows
and
waiting
until
natasha
having
kicked
her
feet
and
turned
over
twice
lay
next
to
her
under
the
same
blanket
her
arms
on
top
it
her
expression
serious
these
nightly
visits
of
natasha
which
took
place
before
the
counts
return
from
the
club
were
one
of
the
favorite
pleasures
of
both
mother
and
daughter
what
is
it
tonight
but
ive
got
to
tell
you
natasha
covered
her
mothers
mouth
with

his
head
completely
i
can
see
that
saying
this
the
countess
glanced
at
her
daughter
natasha
lay
looking
straight
ahead
fixedly
at
one
of
the
carved
mahogany
sphinxes
at
the
corners
of
the
bed
so
that
the
countess
could
see
her
daughters
face
only
in
profile
this
face
struck
the
countess
by
its
especially
serious
and
concentrated
expression
natasha
listened
and
reflected
well
so
what
she
said
youve
turned
his
head
completelybut
why
what
do
you
want
from
him
you
know
you

natasha
did
not

her
to
finish
pulled
the
countesss
big
hand
towards
her
and
kissed
it
on
the
back
then
on
the
palm
then
turned
it
again
and
began
to
kiss
it
on
one
knuckle

in

on
the
next
knuckle
murmuring
in
a
whisper

she
said
glancing
at
her
mother
who
was
looking
at
her
daughter
with
a
tender
gaze
and
while
contemplating
her
like
that
seemed
to
forget
everything
she
wanted
to
say
it
wont
do
dearest
not
everyone
will
understand
your
childhood
ties
and
to
see
him
so
close
to
you
may
harm
you
in
the
eyes
of
other
young
men
who
visit
us
and
above
all
it
torments
him
for
nothing
he
might
have
found
a
rich
match
for

from

natasha
jumped
up
barefoot
and
snatching
her
slippers
ran
to
her
room
she
could
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
time
she
kept
thinking
that
no
one
could
understand
all
that
she
understood
and
all
that
was
in
her
sonya
she
thought
looking
at
the
curledup
sleeping
little
cat
with
her
enormous
braid
no
its
beyond
her
shes
virtuous
she
fell
in
love
with

want
to

anything
else
even
mama
doesnt
understand
its
astonishing
how
intelligent
i
am
and
howsweet
she
is
she
went
on
speaking
of
herself
in
the
third
person
and
imagining
that
it
was
some
very
intelligent
man
saying
it
about
her
the
most
intelligent
and
best
of
mentheres
everything
in
her

this
man
went
on

extraordinarily
intelligent
sweet
and
then
too
pretty
extraordinarily
pretty
nimbleshe

shes
an
excellent
horsewoman
and
the
voice
one
may
say
an
astonishing
voice
she
sang
her
favorite
musical
phrase
from
cherubinis
opera
threw
herself
on
the
bed
laughed
at
the
joyful
thought
that
she
was
about
to
fall
asleep
called
dunyasha
to
put
out
the
candle
and
before
dunyasha
had
left
the
room
had
already
passed
into
a
different
happier
world
of
dreams
where
everything
was
as
light
and
beautiful
as
in
reality
only
still
better
because
it
was
different
the
next
day
the
countess
having
asked
to
see
boris
had
a
talk
with
him
and
from
that
day
on
he

of

thrown
over

thin
shoulders
sonya
already
dressed

in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
pressing
painfully
with

pinning
on
a
last
ribbon
which
squeaked
as
the
pin
went
through
it
not
that
way

that
way
sonya
said
natasha
turning
her
head
and
putting
both
hands
to

holding
it
did
not
have

the
maid
lifting
the
takenup
gauze
dress
with
two
fingers
and
shaking
it
and
blowing
at
something
showing
by
this
gesture
an
awareness
of
the
airiness
and
purity
of
what
she
was
holding
natasha
began
to
put
the
dress
on
one
moment
one
moment

she
cried
to
her
father
who
had
opened

under
the
gauze
of
her
skirt
which
covered
her
whole
face
sonya
slammed

a
moment
later

perfumed

pomaded

natasha
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
spreading
the
folds

the
gauze

said
the
maid
getting
on
her
knees
pulling
at
the
dress
and
moving
the
pins
with
her
tongue
from
one
side
of
her
mouth
to
the
other

sonya
cried
with
despair
in
her
voice
looking
at
natashas
dress
say
what
you
like
its
still
too
long
natasha
stepped
back
to
look
at
herself
in
the
pier
glass
the
dress
was
too
long
by
god
miss
its
not
too
long
at

mavrusha

on
the
floor
following

young
lady

long

a
minute
said
the
resolute
dunyasha
taking
a
needle
out
of
the
fichu
on
her
breast
and
setting
to
work
again
on
the
floor
just
then
the
countess
came
in
bashfully
with
quiet
steps
in
her
toque
and
velvet
dress
ohh
my
beauty
cried
the
count
better
than
any
of
you
he
was
about
to
embrace
her
but
she
retreated
blushing
so
as
not
to
have
her
dress
rumpled
mama
the
toque
more
to
one
side
said
natasha
ill
repin
it
and
she
rushed
forward
and
the
sewing
girls
who
had
no
time
to
follow
her
tore
off
a
piece
of
gauze
my
god
what
is
this
its
not
my
fault
i
swear
never
mind
ill

said
dunyasha
my
beauty
my
queen
the
nanny
said
coming
through
the
door
and
sonyushka
too
what
beauties
at
a
quarter
past
ten
they
finally
got
into
carriages
and
drove
off
but
they
still
had
to
stop
by
the
tavrichesky
garden
mme
peronsky
was
ready
despite
her
old
age
and
unattractiveness
the
same
things
had
gone
on
with
her
as
at
the
rostovs
though
not
as
hurriedly
it
was
a
habitual
thing
for
her
her
old
unattractive
body
had
been
perfumed
washed
powdered
in
just
the
same
way
she
had
been
scrubbed
behind
the
ears
just
as
carefully
and
just
as
at
the
rostovs
her
old
maid
had
delightedly
admired
her
mistresss
outfit
when
she
came
out
to
the
drawing
room
in
a
yellow
dress
with
a
monogram
mme
peronsky
praised
the
attire
of
the
rostovs
the
rostovs
praised
her
taste
and
attire
and
mindful
of
their
dresses
and
hair
put
themselves
into
the
carriages
at
eleven
oclock
and
drove
off
xv
natasha
had
not
had
a
free
moment
since
the
morning
of
that
day
and
had
never
once
had
time
to
think
about
what
lay
ahead
of
her
in
the
damp
cold
air
in
the
incomplete
darkness
of
the
crowded
rocking
carriage
she
imagined
vividly
for
the
first
time
what
awaited
her
there
at
the
ball
in
the
brightly
lit
roomsmusic
flowers
dancing
the
sovereign
all
the
brilliant
youth
of
petersburg
what
awaited
her
was
so
beautiful
that
she
did
not
even
believe
it
could
happen
so
out
of
keeping
it
was
with
the
impression
of
the
cold
the
crowdedness
the
darkness
of
the
carriage
she
understood
what
awaited
her
only
when
having
stepped
over
the
red
baize
of
the
porch
she
entered
the
front
hall
took
off
her
fur
coat
and
walked
beside
sonya
in
front
of
her
mother
between
the
flowers
on
the
lighted
stairway
only
then
did
she
remember
how
one
had
to
behave
at
a
ball
and
try
to
assume
the
majestic
manner
she
considered
necessary
for
a
girl
at
a
ball
but
luckily
for
her
she
felt
her
eyes
looking
everywhere
at
once
she
saw
nothing
clearly
her
pulse
beat
a
hundred
times
a
minute
and
the
blood
began
to
throb
in
her
heart
she
was
unable
to
assume
that
manner
which
would
have
made
her
ridiculous
and
walked
on
faint
with
excitement
and
only
trying
as
hard
as
she
could
to
conceal
it
and
this
was
the
manner
that
was
most
becoming
to
her
before
them
behind
them
also
talking
quietly
and
also
in
ball
gowns
other
guests
were
entering
the
mirrors
on
the
stairway
reflected
ladies
in
white
blue
pink
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
arms
and
necks
natasha
looked
in
the
mirrors
and
in
the
reflections
could
not
distinguish
herself
from
the
others
everything
mixed
into
one
brilliant
procession
at
the
entrance
to
the
first
room
the
monotonous
noise
of
voices
footsteps
greetings
deafened
natasha
the
light
and
brilliance
dazzled
her
still
more
the
host
and
hostess
who
had
already
been
standing
by
the
door
for
half
an
hour
saying
the
same
words
to
the
entering
peoplecharm233
de
vous
voir
greeted
the
rostovs
and
mme
peronsky
in
the
same
way
the
two
girls
in
white
dresses
with
identical
roses
in
their
dark
hair
curtsied
identically
but
the
hostess
involuntarily
rested
her
gaze
longer
on
the
slender
natasha
she
looked
at
her
and
smiled
at
her
alone
with
a
special
smile
in
addition
to
her
hostess
smile
gazing
at
her
the
hostess
may
have
remembered
the
golden
irretrievable
time
of
her
girlhood
and
her
own
first
ball
the
host
also
followed
natasha
with
his
eyes
and
asked
the
count
which
one
was
his
daughter
charmante
he
said
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
the
guests
stood
in
the
ballroom
crowding
by
the
door
waiting
for
the
sovereign
the
countess
placed
herself
in
the
first
rows
of
this
crowd
natasha
heard
and
felt
that
several
voices
were
asking
about
her
and
looking
at
her
she
realized
that
she
was
liked
by
those
who
paid
attention
to
her
and
this
observation
reassured
her
somewhat
there
are
some
like
us
and
some
worse
than
us
she
thought
mme
peronsky
named
for
the
countess
the
most
important
persons
at
the
ball
that
one
is
the
dutch
ambassador
see
the
grayhaired
one
she
said
pointing
to
a
little
old
man
with
abundant
curly
silvergray
hair
surrounded
by
ladies
whom
he
made
laugh
at
something
and
here
she
is
the
queen
of
petersburg
countess
bezukhov
she
said
pointing
to
the
entering
h233l232ne
how
beautiful
she
yields
nothing
to
marya
antonovna
see
how
the
men
dangle
after
her
young
and
old
both
beautiful
and
intelligent
they
say
princehas
lost
his
mind
over
her
but
these
two
here
though
theyre
not
beautiful
are
still
more
surrounded
she
pointed
to
a
lady
who
was
crossing
the
room
with
a
very
unattractive
daughter
shes
a
millionaire
bride
said
mme
peronsky
and
here
come
the
wooers
thats
madame
bezukhovs
brother
anatole
kuragin
she
said
pointing
to
a
handsome
horse
guard
who
walked
past
them
looking
somewhere
above
the
ladies
from
the
height
of
his
raised
head
handsome
isnt

they
say
hes
to
marry
this
rich
one
and
your
cousin
drubetskoy

also
dangling
after
her
very
much
millions

say
why

french
ambassador

she
replied
to
the
countesss
question
about
who
caulaincourt
was

at
him
like
some
sort
of
tsar
but
all
the
same

fat

universal
freemason
said
mme
peronsky
pointing
to
bezukhov
set
him
next
to
his
wife
a
real
tomfool
pierre
walked
along
rolling
his
fat
body
parting
the
crowd
nodding
to
right
and
left
as
casually
and
goodnaturedly
as
if
he
was
walking
through
a
marketplace
crowd
he
moved
through
the
crowd
evidently
searching
for
someone
natasha
looked
joyfully
at
the
familiar
face
of
pierre
that
tomfool
as
mme
peronsky
had
called
him
and
knew
that
pierre
was
looking
for
them
in
the
crowd
and
for
her
in
particular
pierre
had
promised
to
be
at
the
ball
and
to
introduce
partners
to
her
but
before
he
reached
them
bezukhov
stopped
beside
a
very
handsome
darkhaired
man
of
medium
height
in
a
white
uniform
who
was
standing
by
a
window
talking
to
a
tall
man
with
stars
and
a
sash
natasha
immediately
recognized
the
young
man
of
medium
height
in
the
white
uniform
it
was
bolkonsky
who
seemed
to
her
to
have
grown
younger
more
cheerful
and
better
looking
heres
another
acquaintance
bolkonsky

mama
said
natasha
pointing
to
prince
andrei
remember
he
spent
the
night
with

at
otradnoe
ah

him
said
mme
peronsky

and
such
boundless
pride

after
his
papa

in
with
speransky
drafting
some
sort
of
projects

how
he
treats
the
ladies

to
him
and
he

she
said
pointing
to
him
id

to
him

me
the
way
he
does
with
these
ladies
xvi
suddenly
everything
stirred
the
crowd
began
to
talk
moved
together
parted
again
and
between
the
two
rows
of
people
to
the
sounds
of
the
struckup
music
the
sovereign
came
in
behind
him
walked
the
host
and
hostess
the
sovereign
walked
quickly
nodding
to
right
and
left
as
if
trying
to
get
quickly
past
this
first
moment
of
meeting
the
musicians
played
a
polonaise
wellknown
then
from
the
words
written
to
it
these
words
began
alexander
elizaveta
how
we
all
admire
you
the
sovereign
walked
into
the
drawing
room
the
crowd
surged
towards
the
door
several
persons
with
changed
expressions
hurriedly
went
there
and
back
the
crowd
surged
away
from
the
drawingroom
door
again
and
the
sovereign
appeared
in
it
talking
with
the
hostess
a
young
man
with
a
perplexed
look
pressed
up
to
the
ladies
asking
them
to
step
aside
some
ladies
with
faces
that
expressed
a
total
obliviousness
to
all
social
conventions
pushed
forward
ruining
their
fancy
dresses
men
began
to
approach
the
ladies
and
form
couples
for
the
polonaise
everyone
made
way
and
the
sovereign
smiling
and
out
of
step
with
the
music
led
the
hostess
through
the
drawingroom
door
after
him
came
the
host
with
mme
m
a
naryshkin
then
ambassadors
ministers
various
generals
whom
mme
peronsky
kept
naming
without
pause
more
than
half
of
the
ladies
had
partners
and
were
joining
or
preparing
to
join
the
polonaise
natasha
sensed
that
she
would
be
left
with
her
mother
and
sonya
among
the
smaller
the
ladies
pushed
back
against
the
wall
and
not
asked
to
the
polonaise
she
stood
her
thin
arms
lowered
her
barely
defined
bosom
rising
rhythmically
holding
her
breath
her
shining
frightened
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
with
an
expression
of
readiness
either
for
the
greatest
happiness
or
for
the
greatest
grief
she
was
interested
neither
in
the
sovereign
nor
in
any
of
the
important
persons
mme
peronsky
pointed
outshe
had
one
thought
can
it
be
that
no
one
will
come
up
to
me
can
it
be
that
i
wont
dance
among
the
first
can
it
be
that
all
these
men
wont
notice
me
who
now
dont
even
seem
to
see
me
and
if
they
look
at
me
its
with
such
an
expression
as
if
they
were
saying
ah
its
not
her
theres
no
point
in
looking
no
it
cant
be
she
thought
they
must
know
how
i
want
to
dance
and
how
well
i
dance
and
what
fun
it
will
be
for
them
to
dance
with
me
the
sounds
of
the
polonaise
which
had
continued
for
quite
a
long
time
were
already
beginning
to
seem
sada
reminiscence
in
natashas
ears
she
wanted
to
cry
mme
peronsky
left
them
the
count
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
countess
sonya
and
she
stood
alone
as
if
in
a
forest
in
this
crowd
of
strangers
of
no
interest
or
need
to
anyone
prince
andrei
walked
past
them
with
some
lady
obviously
not
recognizing
them
the
handsome
anatole
smiling
was
saying
something
to
the
lady
he
was
leading
and
glanced
at
natashas
face
as
one
would
glance
at
a
wall
boris
walked
past
them
twice
and
turned
away
each
time
berg
and
his
wife
who
were
not
dancing
came
up
to
them
for
natasha
this
family
intimacy
here
at
a
ball
seemed
offensive
as
if
there
were
no
other
place
for
family
conversations
except
at
a
ball
she
did
not
look
at
and
did
not
listen
to
vera
who
was
saying
something
to
her
about
her
green
dress
finally
the
sovereign
stopped
beside
his
last
partner
he
had
danced
with
three
and
the
music
ceased
a
preoccupied
adjutant
ran
up
to
the
rostovs
asking
them
to
step
aside
somewhere
though
they
were
standing
at
the
wall
and
from
the
gallery
came
the
distinct
careful
and
engagingly
rhythmic
sounds
of
a
waltz
the
sovereign
looked
over
the
room
with
a
smile
a
minute
passedno
one
began
yet
the
adjutant
master
of
ceremonies
went
up
to
countess
bezukhov
and
asked
her
to
dance
smiling
she
raised
her
arm
and
placed
it
without
looking
at
him
on
the
adjutants
shoulder
the
adjutant
master
of
ceremonies
an
expert
in
these
matters
confidently
unhurriedly
and
rhythmically
keeping
firm
hold
of
his
partner
set
off
with
her
at
first
in
a
glissade
around
the
edge
of
the
circle
then
at
the
corner
of
the
room
took
her
left
arm
turned
her
and
now
above
the
everquickening
sounds
of
the
music
one
could
hear
only
the
rhythmic
jingle
of
the
spurs
on
the
adjutants
quick
and
nimble
feet
and
at
every
third
beat
the
velvet
dress
of
his
partner
seemed
to
flash
flying
as
she
turned
natasha
looked
at
them
and
was
ready
to
weep
that
it
was
not
she
dancing
this
first
turn
of
the
waltz
prince
andrei
in
his
white
cavalry
colonels
uniform
stockings
and
low
boots
animated
and
merry
stood
in
the
first
rows
of
the
circle
not
far
from
the
rostovs
baron
vierhoff
was
talking
to
him
about
the
first
session
of
the
state
council
planned
for
the
next
day
prince

being
close
to
speransky
and
taking
the
work
of
the
legislative
commission
could
give
accurate
information
about
the
next
days
meeting
of
which
various
rumors
were
circulating
but
he
was
not
listening
to
what
vierhoff
was
telling
him
and
looked
now
at
the
sovereign
now
at
the
gentlemen
preparing
to
dance
who
had
not
yet
ventured
into
the
circle
prince
andrei
was
observing
these
gentlemen
grown
timid
in
the
sovereigns
presence
and
ladies
faint
with
the
desire
to
be
invited

over
to

she
was
a
d233butante
remembered
her
conversation
on
the
window
ledge
and
with
a
merry
expression
on
his
face
went
up
to
countess
rostov
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
daughter
the
countess
said
blushing
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
if
the
countess
remembers
me
said
prince
andrei
with
a
courteous
and
low
bow
totally
contradicting
mme
peronskys
remark
about
his
rudeness
going
up
to
natasha
and
raising
his
arm
to
put
it
around
her
waist
even
before
he
finished
asking
her
to
dance
he
suggested
a
turn
of
the
waltz
that
rapt
expression
of
natashas
face
ready
for
despair
and
for
ecstasy
suddenly
lit
up
with
a
happy
grateful
childlike
smile
ive
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
you
this
frightened
and
happy
girl
seemed
to
say
by
her
smile
shining
through
ready
tears
as
she
raised
her
arm
to
prince
andreis
shoulder
they
were
the
second
couple
to
enter
the
circle
prince
andrei
was
one
of
the
best
dancers
of
his
time
natashas
dancing
was
excellent
her
little
feet
in
satin
ball
slippers
did
their
work
quickly
lightly
and
independently
of
herself
and
her
face
shone
with
the
rapture
of
happiness
her
bared
neck
and
arms
were
thin
and
unattractive
compared
to
h233l232nes
shoulders
her
shoulders
were
thin
her
bosom
undefined
her
arms
slender
but
on
h233l232ne
there
was
already
a
sort
of
varnish
from
all
the
thousands
of
gazes
that
had
passed
over
her
body
while
natasha
looked
like
a
young
girl
who
was
bared
for
the
first
time
and
would
have
been
very
ashamed
of
it
if
she
had
not
been
assured
that
it
had
necessarily
to
be
so
prince
andrei
liked
to
dance
and
wishing
to
rid
himself
quickly
of
the
political
and
intellectual
conversations
with
which
everyone
addressed
him
and
wishing
to
break
quickly
this
vexatious
circle
of
embarrassment
caused
by
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
had
gone
to
dance
and
had
asked
natasha
because
pierre
had
pointed
her
out
to
him
and
because
she
was
the
first
pretty
woman
his
eyes
fell
on
but
as
soon
as
he
put
his
arm
around
her
slender
mobile
quivering
waist
and
she
began
to
move
so
close
to
him
and
smile
so
close
to
him
the
wine
of
her
loveliness
went
to
his
head
he
felt
himself
revived
and
rejuvenated
when
catching
his
breath
and
leaving
her
he
stopped
and
began
to
look
at
the
dancers
xvii
after
prince
andrei
boris
came
up
to
natasha
and
asked
her
to
dance
then
also
that
dancer
adjutant
who
had
opened
the
ball
and
other
young
men
and
natasha
sending
her
surplus
partners
to
sonya
happy
and
flushed
did
not
stop
dancing
all
evening
she
noticed
nothing
and
did
not
see
any
of
what
interested
everyone
at
this
ball
not
only
did
she
not
notice
how
the
sovereign
had
a
long
talk
with
the
french
ambassador
how
he
talked
with
particular
graciousness
with
a
certain
lady
how
prince
soandso
did
and
said
suchandsuch
how
h233l232ne
had
great
success
and
was
granted
the
special
attentions
of
soandso
she
did
not
even
see
the
sovereign
and
noticed
that
he
had
gone
only
because
the
ball
became
more
animated
after
his
departure
in
one
of
the
merry
cotillions
before
supper
prince
andrei
danced
again
with
natasha
he
reminded
her
of
their
first
meeting
in
the
otradnoe
avenue
and
how
she
could
not
fall
asleep
on
that
moonlit
night
and
how
he
involuntarily
overheard
her
natasha
blushed
at
this
reminder
and
tried
to
justify
herself
as
if
there
was
something
shameful
in
that
feeling
which
prince
andrei
had
involuntarily
overheard
from
her
prince
andrei
like
all
people
who
have
grown
up
in
society
liked
to
encounter
things
in
society
that
did
not
have
the
general
society
stamp
on
them
and
natasha
was
just
that
with
her
astonishment
joy
and
timidity
and
even
her
mistakes
in
french
he
treated
her
and
talked
to
her
with
particular
tenderness
and
care
sitting
next
to
her
talking
with
her
about
the
simplest
and
most
insignificant
subjects
prince
andrei
admired
the
joyful
shining
of
her
eyes
and
smile
which
referred
not
to
what
they
were
saying
but
to
her
inner
happiness
at
those
times
when
natasha
was
chosen
and
she
got
up
with
a
smile
and
danced
through
the
room
prince
andrei
especially
admired
her
timid
grace
in
the
middle
of
the
cotillion
natasha
having
finished
a
figure
still
breathing
hard
was
going
to
her
seat
a
new
partner
again
asked
her
to
dance
she
was
tired
and
out
of
breath
and
obviously
wanted
to
refuse
but
then
again
cheerfully
raised
her
arm
to
her
partners
shoulder
and
smiled
to
prince
andrei
that
smile
said
id
be
glad
to
rest
and
sit
with
you
im
tired
but
you
see
ive
been
asked
to
dance
and
im
glad
of
it
and
im
happy
and
i
love
everybody
and
you
and
i
understand
all
that
and
much
much
more
when
her
partner
left
her
natasha
ran
across
the
room
to
invite
two
ladies
for
the
figures
if
she
goes
to
her
cousin
first
and
then
to
another
lady
shell
be
my
wife
prince
andrei
quite
unexpectedly
said
to
himself
looking
at
her
she
went
to
her
cousin
first
what
nonsense
sometimes
comes
into
ones
head
thought
prince
andrei
but
the
one
sure
thing
is
that
this
girl
is
so
sweet
so
special
that
she
wont
spend
a
month
dancing
here
before
she
gets
marriedits
a
rarity
here
he
thought
as
natasha
straightening
a
rose
that
had
gone
awry
on
her
corsage
was
sitting
down
beside
him
at
the
end
of
the
cotillion
the
old
count
in
his
dark
blue
tailcoat
came
over
to
the
dancers
he
invited
prince
andrei
to
come
and
see
him
and
asked
his
daughter
whether
she
was
having
a
good
time
natasha
did
not
reply
and
only
smiled
a
smile
which
said
with
reproach
how
can
you
ask
that
ive
never
enjoyed
myself
so
much
in
my
life
she
said
and
prince
andrei
noticed
how
her
thin
arms
rose
quickly
to
embrace
her
father
and
at
once
dropped
again
natasha
was
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
before
in
her
life
she
was
in
that
highest
degree
of
happiness
when
a
person
becomes
perfectly
kind
and
good
and
does
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
evil
unhappiness
and
grief
at
this
ball
pierre
felt
insulted
for
the
first
time
by
the
position
his
wife
occupied
in
high
spheres
he
was
sullen
and
distracted
there
was
a
deep
furrow
across
his
brow
and
standing
by
the
window
he
looked
through
his
spectacles
seeing
no
one
natasha
walked
past
him
on
her
way
to
supper
pierres
gloomy
unhappy
face
struck
her
she
stopped
in
front
of
him
she
wanted
to
help
him
to
transfer
to
him
the
overflow
of
her
own
happiness
such
a
merry
time
she
said
isnt
it
count
pierre
smiled
distractedly
obviously
not
understanding
what
was
being
said
to
him
yes
im
very
glad
he
said
how
can
they
be
displeased
with
anything
thought
natasha
especially
such
a
nice
man
as
this
bezukhov
in
natashas
eyes
all
who
were
at
the
ball
were
equally
kind
nice
wonderful
people
and
loved
each
other
no
one
could
offend
anyone
and
therefore
they
should
all
be
happy
xviii
the
next
day
prince
andrei
remembered
yesterdays
ball
but
his
thought
did
not
dwell
on
it
for
long
yes
it
was
a
very
brilliant
ball
and
then
tooyes
miss
rostov
is
very
sweet
theres
something
fresh
in
her
something
special
nonpetersburg
that
makes
her
different
that
was
all
he
thought
about
the
ball
and
having
had
tea
he
sat
down
to
work
but
from
fatigue
or
lack
of
sleep
the
day
was
not
good
for
work
and
prince
andrei
could
do
nothing
kept
criticizing
his
own
efforts
as
often
happened
with
him
and
was
glad
when
he
heard
someone
arrive
the
visitor
was
bitsky
who
worked
on
various
commissions
frequented
all
the
societies
of
petersburg
was
a
passionate
admirer
of
the
new
ideas
and
of
speransky
an
anxious
petersburg
newsmonger
one
of
those
people
who
choose
a
trend
as
they
do
their
clothesaccording
to
the
fashion
but
who
because
of
it
look
like
the
most
ardent
partisans
of
the
trend
he
rushed
into
prince
andreis
room
and
barely
managing
to
take
his
hat
off
anxiously
began
talking
he
had
just
learned
the
details
of
the
session
of
the
state
council
that
morning
opened
by
the
sovereign
and
was
recounting
it
with
rapture
the
sovereigns
speech
had
been
extraordinary
it
had
been
one
of
those
speeches
that
only
constitutional
monarchs
make
the
sovereign
said
straight
out
that
the
council
and
the
senate
were
estates
of
the
realm
he
said
that
the
government
should
be
based
not
on
arbitrariness
but
on
firm
principles
the
sovereign
said
that
the
finances
should
be
reformed
and
the
accounting
made
public
bitsky
recounted
emphasizing
certain
words
and
widening
his
eyes
significantly
yes
todays
event
marks
an
epoch
the
greatest
epoch
in
our
history
he
concluded
prince
andrei
listened
to
his
account
of
the
opening
of
the
state
council
which
he
had
awaited
with
such
impatience
and
to
which
he
had
ascribed
such
importance
and
marveled
that
this
event
now
that
it
had
taken
place
not
only
did
not
move
him
but
seemed
less
than
insignificant
with
quiet
mockery
he
listened
to
bitskys
rapturous
account
the
simplest
thought
occurred
to
him
what
do
bitsky
and
i
have
to
do
with
what
the
sovereign
was
pleased
to
say
in
the
council
can
any
of
it
make
me
happier
and
better
and
this
simple
reflection
suddenly
destroyed
for
prince
andrei
all
his
former
interest
in
the
reforms
being
carried
out
that
same
day
prince
andrei
was
supposed
to
dine
at
speranskys
en
petit
comit233
as
the
host
had
said
when
inviting
him
this
dinner
in
the
circle
of
family
and
friends
of
the
man
whom
prince
andrei
so
admired
had
formerly
interested
him
very
much
the
more
so
as
he
had
not
yet
seen
speransky
in
his
domestic
surroundings
but
now
he
did
not
want
to
go
at
the
appointed
dinner
hour
however
prince
andrei
was
already
entering
speranskys
modest
private
house
near
the
tavrichesky
garden
in
the
parqueted
dining
room
of
the
modest
house
distinguished
by
its
extraordinary
cleanliness
reminiscent
of
monastic
cleanliness
prince
andrei
who
was
slightly
late
found
that
at
five
oclock
the
whole
company
of
that
petit
comit233
of
speranskys
intimate
acquaintances
had
already
gathered
there
were
no
ladies
except
for
speranskys
little
daughter
with
a
long
face
resembling
her
fathers
and
her
governess
the
guests
were
gervais
magnitsky
and
stolypin
in
the
front
hall
prince
andrei
already
heard
loud
voices
and
ringing
clipped
laughterlaughter
similar
to
what
one
hears
on
the
stage
some
voice
similar
to
speranskys
rapped
out
a
distinct
ha
ha
ha
prince
andrei
had
never
heard
speransky
laugh
and
this
ringing
highpitched
laughter
from
a
statesman
struck
him
as
strange
prince
andrei
entered
the
dining
room
the
whole
company
was
standing
between
two
windows
by
a
small
table
with
hors
doeuvres
speransky
in
a
gray
tailcoat
with
a
star
and
evidently
in
the
same
white
waistcoat
and
high
white
necktie
he
had
worn
at
the
famous
session
of
the
state
council
stood
by
the
table
with
a
merry
face
the
guests
stood
around
him
magnitsky
addressing
mikhail
mikhailovich
was
telling
an
anecdote
speransky
listened
laughing
beforehand
at
what
magnitsky
was
about
to
say
just
as
prince
andrei
entered
the
dining
room
magnitskys
words
were
again
drowned
by
laughter
stolypin
produced
a
loud
bass
chewing
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
gervais
hissed
out
a
quiet
chuckle
and
speransky
laughed
his
high
and
clipped
laugh
speransky
still
laughing
gave
prince
andrei
his
white
tender
hand
very
glad
to
see
you
prince
he
said
just
a
moment
he
turned
to
magnitsky
interrupting
his
story
weve
agreed
that
tonight
will
be
a
dinner
for
pleasure
and
not
a
word
about
business
he
turned
back
to
the
speaker
and
laughed
again
prince
andrei
listened
to
his
laughter
and
looked
at
the
laughing
speransky
with
surprise
and
sad
disappointment
this
was
not
speransky
but
another
man
as
it
seemed
to
prince
andrei
everything
in
speransky
that
had
formerly
seemed
mysterious
and
attractive
to
prince
andrei
suddenly
became
clear
and
unattractive
to
him
at
the
table
the
conversation
did
not
let
up
for
a
moment
and
seemed
to
consist
of
a
collection
of
funny
anecdotes
before
magnitsky
finished
his
story
someone
else
announced
his
readiness
to
tell
something
still
funnier
the
anecdotes
were
for
the
most
if
not
with
the
world
of
government
service
then
with
persons
in
the
service
it
seemed
that
the
insignificance
of
those
persons
had
been
so
definitely
decided
upon
in
this
company
that
the
only
possible
attitude
towards
them
was
a
goodnaturedly
comic
one
speransky
told
how
at
the
council
that
morning
a
deaf
dignitary
when
asked
his
opinion
had
replied
that
he
was
of
the
same
opinion
gervais
recounted
a
whole
case
about
an
audit
remarkable
for
the
senselessness
of
all
the
persons
involved
stolypin
stuttering
mixed
into
the
conversation
and
began
talking
vehemently
about
abuses
under
the
former
order
of
things
threatening
to
give
the
conversation
a
serious
character
magnitsky
began
to
make
fun
of
stolypins
vehemence
gervais
put
in
a
joke
and
the
conversation
resumed
its
former
merry
course
obviously
speransky
liked
to
relax
after
work
and
make
merry
in
a
friendly
circle
and
all
his
guests
understanding
his
wish
tried
to
make
him
merry
and
be
merry
themselves
but
this
merriment
seemed
heavy
and
cheerless
to
prince
andrei
speranskys
highpitched
voice
struck
him
as
unpleasant
and
his
constant
laughter
for
some
reason
offended
prince
andreis
feelings
by
its
false
note
prince
andrei
did
not
laugh
and
feared
he
would
be
a
deadweight
on
the
company
but
no
one
noticed
his
lack
of
harmony
with
the
general
mood
they
all
seemed
to
be
very
merry
he
wanted
several
times
to
enter
the
conversation
but
each
time
his
word
was
thrown
out
like
a
cork
out
of
water
and
he
was
unable
to
joke
along
with
them
there
was
nothing
bad
or
inappropriate
in
what
they
said
everything
was
witty
and
might
have
been
funny
but
that
something
which
constitutes
the
salt
of
merriment
was
not
only
missing
but
they
did
not
even
know
it
existed
after
dinner
speranskys
daughter
and
her
governess
got
up
speransky
stroked
his
daughter
with
his
white
hand
and
kissed
her
and
this
gesture
seemed
unnatural
to
prince
andrei
the
men
remained
at
the
table
over
the
port
english
style
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
that
started
up
about
napoleons
spanish
campaign
of
which
they
all
held
the
same
approving
opinion
prince
andrei
began
to
contradict
them
speransky
smiled
and
obviously
trying
to
divert
the
conversation
from
the
direction
it
had
taken
told
an
anecdote
that
had
no
relation
to
it
they
all
fell
silent
for
several
moments
having
sat
at
the
table
for
a
while
speransky
corked
the
wine
bottle
and
saying
good
wine
costs
a
pretty
penny
these
days
handed
it
to
the
servant
and
got
up
they
all
got
up
and
with
the
same
noisy
talk
went
to
the
drawing
room
speransky
was
handed
two
envelopes
brought
by
a
courier
he
took
them
and
went
to
his
study
as
soon
as
he
left
the
general
merriment
died
down
and
the
guests
began
talking
sensibly
and
quietly
with
each
other
well
now
for
a
declamation
said
speransky
coming
out
of
his
study
an
astonishing
talent
he
said
to
prince
andrei
magnitsky
at
once
assumed
a
pose
and
began
to
recite
humorous
verses
he
had
composed
in
french
about
certain
persons
wellknown
in
petersburg
and
was
interrupted
several
times
by
applause
when
the
verses
were
over
prince
andrei
went
up
to
speransky
to
take
his
leave
leaving
so
early
said
speransky
i
promised
to
be
at
a
soir233e
they
fell
silent
prince
andrei
looked
closely
into
those
mirrorlike
eyes
which
did
not
let
anything
in
and
felt
how
ridiculous
it
was
that
he
could
have
expected
anything
from
speransky
and
from
all
his
activity
connected
with
him
and
that
he
could
have
ascribed
importance
to
what
speransky
was
doing
that
precise
mirthless
laughter
went
on
ringing
in
prince
andreis
ears
long
after
he
had
left
speransky
on
returning
home
prince
andrei
began
to
recall
his
petersburg
life
of
those
last
four
months
as
if
it
was
something
new
he
recalled
his
solicitations
his
petitioning
the
story
of
his
project
for
military
regulations
which
had
been
taken
into
consideration
but
which
they
had
tried
to
silence
solely
because
another
project
a
very
bad
one
had
already
been
developed
and
presented
to
the
sovereign
he
recalled
the
sessions
of
the
committee
of
which
berg
was
a
member
he
recalled
how
at
these
sessions
everything
to
do
with
the
form
and
procedure
of
the
committees
sessions
was
discussed
carefully
and
at
length
and
everything
to
do
with
the
essence
of
the
matter
was
carefully
and
briefly
dispensed
with
he
recalled
his
work
on
legislation
the
concern
with
which
he
had
translated
the
articles
of
the
roman
and
french
codes
into
russian
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
then
he
vividly
pictured
bogucharovo
his
occupations
in
the
country
his
trip
to
ryazan
recalled
the
muzhiks
the
headman
dron
and
applying
to
them
the
personal
rights
he
had
classified
by
paragraphs
he
felt
astonished
that
he
could
have
been
occupied
with
such
idle
work
for
so
long
xix
the
next
day
prince
andrei
went
to
visit
certain
houses
he
had
not
been
to
yet
among
them
the
house
of
the
rostovs
with
whom
he
had
renewed
his
acquaintance
at
the
last
ball
besides
the
rules
of
courtesy
according
to
which
he
ought
to
call
on
the
rostovs
prince
andrei
wanted
to
see
at
home
that
special
animated
girl
who
had
left
him
with
such
a
pleasant
memory
natasha
was
one
of
the
first
to
meet
him
she
was
wearing
a
dark
blue
everyday
dress
in
which
she
seemed
still
better
to
prince
andrei
than
in
a
ball
gown
she
and
the
whole
rostov
family
received
prince
andrei
like
an
old
friend
simply
and
cordially
the
whole
family
which
prince
andrei
used
to
judge
so
severely
now
seemed
to
him
to
consist
of
wonderful
simple
and
kind
people
the
old
counts
hospitality
and
goodnature
which
struck
one
especially
nicely
in
petersburg
was
such
that
prince
andrei
could
not
refuse
to
stay
for
dinner
yes
theyre
kind
nice
people
thought
bolkonsky
who
of
course
dont
understand
a
whit
of
the
treasure
they
have
in
natasha
but
kind
people
who
constitute
the
best
backdrop
for
setting
off
this
special
girl
so
poetic
lovely
and
overflowing
with
life
prince
andrei
sensed
in
natasha
the
presence
of
a
special
world
completely
foreign
to
him
filled
with
joys
of
a
sort
as
yet
unknown
to
him
that
foreign
world
which
even
then
in
the
otradnoe
avenue
and
at
the
window
on
that
moonlit
night
had
enticed
him
so
now
that
world
no
longer
enticed
him
it
was
no
longer
foreign
but
he
himself
having
entered
it
found
in
it
a
new
delight
after
dinner
natasha
at
prince
andreis
request
went
to
the
clavichord
and
began
to
sing
prince
andrei
stood
by
the
window
talking
with
the
ladies
and
listened
to
her
in
the
middle
of
a
phrase
prince
andrei
fell
silent
and
suddenly
felt
choked
with
tears
which
he
did
not
know
was
possible
for
him
he
looked
at
the
singing
natasha
and
something
new
and
happy
occurred
in
his
soul
he
was
happy
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
sad
he
had
decidedly
nothing
to
weep
about
but
he
was
ready
to
weep
about
what
his
former
love
the
little
princess
his
disappointmentshis
hopes
for
the
futureyes
and
no
the
main
thing
he
wanted
to
weep
about
was
a
sudden
vivid
awareness
of
the
terrible
opposition
between
something
infinitely
great
and
indefinable
that
was
in
him
and
something
narrow
and
fleshly
that
he
himself
and
even
she
was
this
opposition
tormented
him
and
gladdened
him
while
she
sang
as
soon
as
natasha
finished
singing
she
went
over
to
him
and
asked
him
how
he
liked
her
voice
she
asked
it
and
became
embarrassed
just
after
she
said
it
realizing
that
it
was
not
a
question
to
be
asked
he
smiled
looking
at
her
and
said
that
he
liked
her
singing
just
as
he
liked
everything
she
did
prince
andrei
left
the
rostovs
late
in
the
evening
he
went
to
bed
as
was
his
habit
but
soon
realized
that
he
could
not
sleep
lighting
a
candle
he
would
sit
on
the
bed
then
get
up
then
lie
down
again
not
troubled
in
the
least
by
his
insomnia
he
felt
as
joyful
and
new
in
his
soul
as
if
he
had
gone
from
a
stuffy
room
into
gods
open
world
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
was
in
love
with
miss
rostov
he
was
not
thinking
of
her
he
only
pictured
her
to
himself
and
owing
to
that
his
whole
life
appeared
to
him
in
a
new
light
why
do
i
thrash
about
why
do
i
fuss
inside
this
narrow
limited
frame
when
life
the
whole
of
life
with
all
its
joys
is
open
to
me
he
said
to
himself
and
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
while
he
began
making
happy
plans
for
the
future
he
decided
that
he
must
occupy
himself
with
the
education
of
his
son
by
finding
a
tutor
for
him
and
entrusting
the
boy
to
the
tutor
then
he
must
retire
from
the
service
and
go
abroad
to
see
england
switzerland
italy
i
must
use
my
freedom
while
i
feel
so
much
youth
and
strength
in
me
he
said
to
himself
pierre
was
right
when
he
said
that
one
must
believe
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
in
order
to
be
happy
and
i
now
believe
in
it
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
but
while
im
alive
i
must
live
and
be
happy
he
thought
xx
one
morning
colonel
adolf
berg
whom
pierre
knew
as
he
knew
everyone
in
moscow
and
petersburg
came
to
see
him
in
a
spankingnew
uniform
and
with
his
sidewhiskers
brushed
and
pomaded
forward
as
the
sovereign
alexander
pavlovich
wore
them
i
just
called
on
the
countess
your
spouse
and
was
so
unlucky
as
to
have
my
request
go
unfulfilled
i
hope
that
with
you
count
i
shall
have
more
luck
he
said
smiling
what
can
i
do
for
you
colonel
im
at
your
service
i
am
now
fully
settled
in
the
new
apartment
count
berg
informed
him
obviously
knowing
that
it
could
not
be
unpleasant
to
hear
it
and
therefore
would
like
to
arrange
a
small
soir233e
for
my
and
my
wifes
acquaintances
he
smiled
still
more
pleasantly
i
wanted
to
ask
the
countess
and
you
to
do
me
the
honor
of
joining
us
for
a
cup
of
tea
andsupper
only
countess
elena
vassilievna
considering
the
company
of
some
sort
of
bergs
humiliating
to
her
could
be
so
cruel
as
to
refuse
such
an
invitation
berg
explained
so
clearly
why
he
wished
to
gather
a
small
and
good
company
at
his
place
and
why
this
would
be
a
pleasure
for
him
and
why
he
would
be
sorry
to
spend
money
on
cards
or
on
something
bad
but
on
good
company
he
was
ready
to
suffer
the
expense
that
pierre
could
not
refuse
and
promised
to
come
only
not
late
count
if
i
may
ask
around
ten
minutes
to
eight
if
i
may
ask
well
have
a
game
of
cards
our
general
will
join
us
hes
very
kind
to
me
well
have
supper
count
so
do
me
the
favor
contrary
to
his
habit
of
being
late
pierre
came
to
the
bergs
that
day
at
a
quarter
to
eight
instead
of
ten
minutes
to
eight
the
bergs
having
prepared
everything
necessary
for
the
soir233e
were
ready
to
receive
their
guests
in
the
new
clean
bright
study
decorated
with
little
busts
and
little
pictures
and
new
furniture
sat
berg
and
his
wife
berg
in
a
brand
new
buttonedup
uniform
sat
beside
his
wife
explaining
to
her
that
one
can
and
must
have
acquaintances
among
people
above
oneself
because
only
then
can
one
find
pleasure
in
ones
acquaintances
you
can
imitate
something
you
can
ask
for
something
just
look
how
ive
fared
since
the
lower
ranks
berg
reckoned
up
his
life
not
in
years
but
in
imperial
rewards
my
comrades
are
still
nobodies
now
but
i
already
occupy
the
post
of
a
regimental
commander
and
i
have
the
happiness
of
being
your
husband
he
got
up
and
kissed
veras
hand
but
on
his
way
straightened
the
turnedback
corner
of
the
carpet
and
how
have
i
acquired
it
all
mainly
by
knowing
how
to
choose
my
acquaintances
it
goes
without
saying
that
one
must
be
virtuous
and
precise
berg
smiled
with
a
consciousness
of
his
superiority
over
a
weak
woman
and
fell
silent
thinking
that
all
the
same
this
sweet
wife
of
his
was
a
weak
woman
who
could
not
comprehend
all
that
made
up
the
dignity
of
a
manein
mann
zu
sein
at
the
same
time
vera
also
smiled
with
a
consciousness
of
her
superiority
over
her
virtuous
good
husband
who
all
the
same
understood
life
wrongly
as
in
veras
view
all
men
did
berg
judging
by
his
wife
considered
all
women
weak
and
stupid
vera
judging
by
her
husband
alone
and
extending
the
observation
to
everyone
supposed
that
all
men
ascribed
reason
only
to
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
understood
nothing
were
proud
and
egoistic
berg
got
up
and
embracing
his
wife
carefully
so
as
not
to
rumple
her
lace
pelerine
for
which
he
had
paid
dearly
kissed
her
in
the
middle
of
the
lips
only
we
shouldnt
have
children
too
soon
he
said
following
an
unconscious
association
of
ideas
yes
replied
vera
i
dont
want
that
at
all
one
must
live
for
society
thats
exactly
the
same
as
princess
yusupov
wore
said
berg
with
a
happy
and
kindly
smile
pointing
to
the
pelerine
just
then
the
arrival
of
count
bezukhov
was
announced
the
two
spouses
exchanged
selfsatisfied
smiles
each
silently
claiming
the
honor
of
this
visit
thats
what
it
means
to
know
how
to
make
acquaintances
thought
berg
thats
what
it
means
to
know
how
to
behave
only
please
when
im
entertaining
the
guests
said
vera
dont
interrupt
me
because
i
know
how
to
entertain
each
of
them
and
what
to
say
in
all
kinds
of
company
berg
also
smiled
impossible
sometimes
men
must
have
a
male
conversation
he
said
pierre
was
received
in
the
nice
new
drawing
room
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
sit
down
anywhere
without
violating
the
symmetry
cleanliness
and
order
and
therefore
it
was
quite
comprehensible
and
not
strange
that
berg
magnanimously
suggested
disturbing
the
symmetry
of
an
armchair
or
a
sofa
for
his
dear
guest
and
obviously
in
a
painful
dilemma
himself
in
this
respect
left
the
resolving
of
this
question
to
his
guests
choice
pierre
upset
the
symmetry
by
moving
a
chair
towards
him
and
berg
and
vera
at
once
began
the
evening
interrupting
each
other
and
entertaining
the
guest
vera
having
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
pierre
must
be
entertained
by
a
conversation
about
the
french
embassy
began
this
conversation
at
once
berg
having
decided
that
there
was
also
need
for
a
male
conversation
interrupted
his
wife
and
touched
upon
the
question
of
war
with
austria
and
involuntarily
shifted
the
general
conversation
to
his
personal
considerations
about
the
offers
made
him
in
regard
to
taking
the
austrian
campaign
and
to
the
reasons
why
he
had
not
accepted
them
though
the
conversation
was
very
incoherent
and
vera
was
angry
at
the
interference
of
the
male
element
the
two
spouses
felt
with
satisfaction
that
even
though
there
was
only
one
guest
the
soir233e
had
begun
very
well
and
that
it
was
as
like
any
other
soir233e
with
conversation
tea
and
lighted
candles
as
two
drops
of
water
soon
boris
arrived
bergs
old
comrade
he
treated
berg
and
vera
with
a
certain
tinge
of
superiority
and
patronage
after
boris
came
a
lady
with
a
colonel
then
the
general
himself
then
the
rostovs
and
the
soir233e
now
became
quite
indisputably
like
all
other
soir233es
berg
and
vera
could
not
contain
their
joyful
smiles
at
the
sight
of
this
movement
about
the
drawing
room
at
the
sound
of
this
disjointed
talk
the
rustling
of
dresses
and
bowing
everything
was
like
at
everyone
elses
house
and
especially
like
was
the
general
who
praised
the
little
apartment
patted
berg
on
the
shoulder
and
with
paternal
authority
ordered
the
tables
set
for
boston
the
general
sat
down
to
play
with
count
ilya
andreevich
as
the
most
distinguished
guest
after
himself
the
old
with
the
old
the
young
with
the
young
the
hostess
by
the
tea
table
on
which
there
were
exactly
the
same
cakes
in
a
silver
basket
as
the
panins
had
at
their
soir233eeverything
was
exactly
the
same
as
with
everyone
else
xxi
pierre
as
one
of
the
most
honored
guests
had
to
sit
down
to
boston
with
ilya
andreevich
the
general
and
the
colonel
at
the
boston
table
pierre
happened
to
sit
facing
natasha
and
he
was
struck
by
the
odd
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
since
the
day
of
the
ball
natasha
was
silent
and
not
only
was
not
as
beautiful
as
she
had
been
at
the
ball
but
would
even
have
been
plain
if
she
had
not
had
such
look
of
meekness
and
indifference
to
everything
whats
the
matter
with
her
pierre
wondered
glancing
at
her
she
was
sitting
beside
her
sister
at
the
tea
table
and
replied
reluctantly
without
looking
at
him
to
something
boris
said
as
he
sat
down
by
her
having
gone
through
a
whole
suit
and
taken
five
tricks
much
to
his
partners
delight
pierre
who
heard
an
exchange
of
greetings
and
the
sound
of
someones
footsteps
coming
into
the
room
as
he
was
gathering
in
his
tricks
looked
at
her
again
whats
going
on
with
her
he
said
to
himself
with
still
greater
surprise
prince
andrei
was
standing
before
her
with
a
solicitously
tender
expression
and
saying
something
to
her
she
having
raised
her
head
was
looking
at
him
blushing
deeply
and
clearly
trying
to
restrain
her
fitful
breathing
and
the
bright
light
of
some
inner
fire
previously
extinguished
again
burned
in
her
she
was
quite
transformed
from
plain
she
again
became
as
she
had
been
at
the
ball
prince
andrei
went
over
to
pierre
and
pierre
noticed
a
new
young
expression
in
his
friends
face
pierre
changed
his
place
several
times
during
the
game
sitting
now
with
his
back
to
natasha
now
facing
her
and
in
the
course
of
all
six
rubbers
observed
her
and
his
friend
something
very
important
is
going
on
between
them
thought
pierre
and
a
joyful
and
at
the
same
time
bitter
feeling
stirred
him
and
made
him
forget
the
game
after
six
rubbers
the
general
got
up
saying
it
was
impossible
to
play
that
way
and
pierre
was
set
free
natasha
stood
to
one
side
talking
with
sonya
and
boris
vera
with
a
subtle
smile
was
talking
with
prince
andrei
pierre
went
over
to
his
friend
and
having
asked
whether
what
they
were
talking
about
was
a
secret
sat
down
beside
them
vera
having
noticed
prince
andreis
attention
to
natasha
had
decided
that
at
a
soir233e
at
a
real
soir233e
it
was
necessary
to
have
subtle
allusions
to
feelings
and
seizing
a
moment
when
prince
andrei
was
alone
began
a
conversation
with
him
about
feelings
in
general
and
about
her
sister
with
such
an
intelligent
guest
as
she
considered
prince
andrei
to
be
she
had
to
employ
her
diplomatic
art
when
pierre
came
up
to
them
he
noticed
that
vera
was
conversing
with
selfsatisfied
enthusiasm
while
prince
andrei
seemed
embarrassed
which
seldom
happened
to
him
what
do
you
think
vera
said
with
a
subtle
smile
youre
so
perceptive
prince
and
understand
peoples
characters
so
well
at
once
what
do
you
think
about
natalie
can
she
be
constant
in
her
attachments
can
she
like
other
women
vera
meant
herself
fall
in
love
with
a
man
once
and
remain
faithful
to
him
forever
that
is
what
i
consider
real
love
what
do
you
think
prince
i
dont
know
your
sister
well
enough
prince
andrei
replied
with
a
mocking
smile
behind
which
he
hoped
to
hide
his
embarrassment
to
answer
such
a
subtle
question
and
besides
ive
observed
that
the
less
attractive
the
woman
the
more
constant
she
is
he
added
and
looked
at
pierre
who
approached
them
just
then
yes
thats
true
prince
in
our
time
vera
went
on
mentioning
our
time
as
limited
people
generally
like
to
do
supposing
that
they
have
discovered
and
appreciated
the
particularities
of
our
time
and
that
peoples
qualities
change
with
time
in
our
time
a
girl
has
so
much
freedom
that
le
plaisir
d234tre
courtis233e
often
stifles
true
feeling
in
her
et
natalie
il
faut
lavouer
y
est
tr232s
sensible
the
return
to
natalie
again
made
prince
andrei
wince
unpleasantly
he
wanted
to
get
up
but
vera
continued
with
a
still
more
subtle
smile
i
think
no
one
has
been
so
courtis233e
as
she
vera
said
but
till
recently
she
never
liked
anyone
seriously
you
know
count
she
turned
to
pierre
even
our
dear
cousin
boris
who
entre
nous
was
quite
quite
dans
le
pays
du
tendre
she
said
alluding
to
the
then
popular
map
of
love
prince
andrei
frowned
and
said
nothing
but
youre
friends
with
boris
arent
you
vera
asked
him
yes
i
know
him
surely
he
has
told
you
about
his
childhood
love
for
natasha
was
there
a
childhood
love
prince
andrei
asked
suddenly
blushing
yes
vous

entre
cousin
et
cousine
cette

quelquefois

lamour
le
cousinage
est
un
dangereux
voisinage
nestce
pas
oh
undoubtedly
said
prince
andrei
and
suddenly
with
unnatural
animation
he
began
joking
with
pierre
about
how
he
ought
to
be
careful
in
dealing
with
his
fiftyyearold
moscow
cousins
and
in
the
middle
of
the
banter
got
up
and
taking
pierre
by
the
arm
drew
him
aside
what
now
said
pierre
looking
with
surprise
at
his
friends
strange
animation
and
noticing
the
glance
he
cast
at
natasha
as
he
got
up
i
must
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
said
prince
andrei
you
know
those
womens
gloves
he
meant
the
masonic
gloves
which
were
given
to
a
newly
initiated
brother
to
be
presented
to
a
beloved
woman
ibut
no
ill
talk
with
you
later
and
prince
andrei
with
a
strange
gleam
in
his
eyes
and
with
uneasy
movements
went
over
to
natasha
and
sat
down
beside
her
pierre
saw
how
prince
andrei
asked
her
something
and
she
blushing
answered
him
but
just
then
berg
came
up
to
pierre
insistently
begging
him
to
take
an
argument
between
the
general
and
the
colonel
about
spanish
affairs
berg
was
pleased
and
happy
the
smile
of
joy
never
left
his
face
the
soir233e
went
very
well
and
exactly
like
other
soir233es
he
had
seen
everything
was
similar
the
ladies
subtle
conversation
and
the
cards
and
the
general
raising
his
voice
over
cards
and
the
samovar
and
the
cakes
but
there
was
one
thing
missing
that
he
had
always
seen
at
the
soir233es
he
wished
to
imitate
the
missing
thing
was
loud
conversation
among
the
men
and
an
argument
about
something
important
and
intellectual
the
general
began
that
conversation
and
berg
drew
pierre
into
it
xxii
the
next
day
prince
andrei
went
to
the
rostovs
for
dinner
as
count
ilya
andreich
had
invited
him
and
spent
the
whole
day
with
them
everyone
in
the
house
sensed
for
whose
sake
prince
andrei
had
come
and
he
without
concealing
it
tried
to
be
with
natasha
the
whole
day
not
only
in
natashas
soul
frightened
but
happy
and
enraptured
but
in
all
the
house
there
was
a
sense
of
fear
in
the
face
of
something
important
that
was
about
to
be
accomplished
the
countess
looked
at
prince
andrei
with
her
sad
and
sternly
serious
eyes
as
he
talked
with
natasha
and
timidly
pretended
to
begin
some
insignificant
conversation
as
soon
as
he
turned
to
look
at
her
sonya
was
afraid
to
leave
natasha
and
afraid
of
being
a
nuisance
when
she
was
with
them
natasha
turned
pale
from
fearful
expectation
when
she
was
left
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
prince
andrei
amazed
her
by
his
timidity
she
felt
that
he
had
to
tell
her
something
but
could
not
resolve
to
do
it
when
prince
andrei
left
in
the
evening
the
countess
went
over
to
natasha
and
said
in
a
whisper
well
mama
for
gods
sake
dont
ask
me
anything
now
its
impossible
to
talk
about
it
said
natasha
but
in
spite
of
that
natasha
now
excited
now
frightened
her
eyes
staring
lay
for
a
long
time
in
her
mothers
bed
that
evening
she
told
her
how
he
had
praised
her
then
how
he
had
said
he
would
be
going
abroad
then
had
asked
where
they
would
spend
the
summer
then
how
he
had
asked
her
about
boris
but
nothing
nothing
like
thishas
ever
happened
to
me
before
she
said
only
im
frightened
im
always
frightened
with
himwhat
does
it
mean
it
means
its
something
real
doesnt
it
mama
are
you
asleep
no
dearest
im
frightened
myself
her
mother
replied
go
i
wont
sleep
anyway
how
stupid
it
is
to
sleep
mama
mama
nothing
like
this
has
ever
happened
to
me
she
repeated
with
astonishment
and
fear
before
the
feeling
she
was
aware
of
within
her
who
could
have
thought
it
seemed
to
natasha
that
when
she
had
first
seen
prince
andrei
in
otradnoe
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
she
was
as
if
frightened
by
this
strange
unexpected
happiness
that
the
one
she
had
already
chosen
then
she
was
firmly
convinced
of
it
that
that
same
one
had
now
met
her
again
and
seemed
not
to
be
indifferent
to
her
why
did
he
have
to
come
to
petersburg
precisely
now
when
were
here
why
did
we
have
to
meet
at
that
ball
its
all
fate
its
clearly
fate
everything
has
been
leading
up
to
it
back
then
when
id
only
just
seen
him
i
felt
something
special
what
else
did
he
say
to
you
there
were
some
verses
read
them
her
mother
said
pensively
asking
about
the
verses
that
prince
andrei
had
written
in
natashas
album
mama
its
not
shameful
that
hes
a
widower
enough
natasha
pray
to
god
les
mariages
se
font
dans
les
cieux
mama
darling
how
i
love
you
how
good
i
feel
natasha
cried
shedding
tears
of
happiness
and
excitement
and
embracing
her
mother
at
that
same
time
andrei
was
sitting
with
pierre
and
telling
him
of
his
love
for
natasha
and
of
his
firm
intention
to
marry
her
that
evening
there
was
a
reception
at
countess
elena
vassilievnas
there
was
the
french
ambassador
there
was
a
prince
who
had
lately
become
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
countesss
house
and
there
were
many
brilliant
ladies
and
gentlemen
pierre
came
downstairs
strolled
through
the
rooms
and
struck
all
the
guests
by
his
concentratedly
distracted
and
gloomy
look
since
the
time
of
the
ball
pierre
had
been
feeling
in
himself
the
approach
of
an
attack
of
hypochondria
and
had
been
making
desperate
efforts
to
fight
it
off
since
the
time
of
his
wifes
closeness
to
the
prince
pierre
had
been
unexpectedly
granted
the
rank
of
gentleman
of
the
chamber
and
since
that
time
he
had
begun
to
feel
the
burden
and
shame
of
grand
society
and
his
former
gloomy
thoughts
about
the
vanity
of
all
human
things
had
begun
to
visit
him
more
often
at
the
same
time
the
feeling
he
had
noticed
between
his
prot233g233e
natasha
and
prince
andrei
his
contrasting
of
his
own
position
with
that
of
his
friend
intensified
this
gloomy
mood
still
more
he
tried
equally
to
avoid
thoughts
of
his
wife
and
of
natasha
and
prince
andrei
again
everything
seemed
insignificant
to
him
compared
with
eternity
again
the
question
what
for
presented
itself
and
he
made
himself
work
day
and
night
over
masonic
writings
hoping
to
ward
off
the
approaching
evil
spirit
towards
midnight
having
left
the
countesss
rooms
pierre
was
sitting
at
his
desk
upstairs
in
the
lowceilinged
smokefilled
study
wearing
a
shabby
dressing
gown
copying
the
original
scottish
charters
when
someone
came
into
his
room
it
was
prince
andrei
ah
its
you
said
pierre
with
a
distracted
and
displeased
air
and
here
i
am
working
he
said
pointing
to
his
notebook
with
that
look
of
escaping
from
lifes
adversities
with
which
unhappy
people
look
at
their
work
prince
andrei
with
a
radiant
rapturous
face
renewed
towards
life
stopped
before
pierre
and
not
noticing
his
sad
face
smiled
at
him
with
the
egoism
of
happiness
well
dear
heart
he
said
i
wanted
to
tell
you
yesterday
and
ive
come
to
tell
you
today
ive
never
experienced
anything
like
it
im
in
love
my
friend
pierre
suddenly
sighed
deeply
and
dropped
his
heavy
body
onto
the
sofa
beside
prince
andrei
with
natasha
rostov
is
it
he
said
yes
yes
who
else
id
never
have
believed
it
but
this
feeling
is
stronger
than
i
am
yesterday
i
was
tormented
i
suffered
but
i
wouldnt
trade
that
torment
for
anything
in
the
world
ive
never
lived
before
only
now

i
alive
but
i
cant
live
without
her
but
can
she
love
meim
too
old
for
herwhy
dont
you
speak
i
i
what

i
telling
you
pierre
said
suddenly
getting
up
and
beginning
to
pace
the
room
ive
always
thought
sothis
girl
is
such
a
treasure
such
ashes
a
rare
girlmy
dear
friend
i

sure

no
man

but
she
she

you
dont

said
prince
andrei
smiling
and
looking
into
pierres
eyes
she
loves
you
i
know
it
pierre
shouted
angrily
no
listen
said
prince
andrei
stopping
him
by
the
arm
can
you
know
what
state
im
in
i
must
tell
it
all
to
somebody
well
well
talk
im
very
glad
said
pierre
and
indeed
his
face
changed
the
furrow
smoothed
out
and
he
listened
joyfully
to
prince
andrei
prince
andrei
seemed
and
was
quite
a
different
new
man
where
was
his
anguish
his
contempt
for
life
his
disillusionment
pierre
was
the
only
man
before
whom
he
would
venture
to
speak
himself
out
but
then
he
spoke
everything
that
was
in
his
heart
first
he
lightly
and
boldly
made
plans
far
into
the
future
saying
how
he
could
not
sacrifice
his
happiness
to
his
fathers
whim
how
he
would
make
his
father
agree
to
this
marriage
and
love
her
or
else
he
would
do
without
his
consent
then
he
was
astonished
as
at
something
strange
alien
independent
of
him
at
the
feeling
that
possessed
him
i
wouldnt
have
believed
it
if
someone
had
told
me
i
could
love
so
much
said
prince
andrei
its
quite
a
different
feeling
from
what
i
knew
before
the
whole
world
is
divided
for
me
into
two
parts
one
is
she
and
there
is
all
happiness
hope
light
the
other
is
where
she
is
not
and
there
everything
is
dejection
and
darkness
darkness
and
gloom
pierre
repeated
yes
yes
i
understand
that
i
cant
help
loving
the
light
its
not
my
fault
and
im
very
happy
do
you
understand
me
i
know
youre
glad
for
me
yes
yes
pierre
agreed
looking
at
his
friend
with
tender
and
sad
eyes
the
brighter
prince
andreis
fate
seemed
to
him
the
gloomier
seemed
his
own
xxiii
for
marriage
he
needed
his
fathers
consent
and
for
that
prince
andrei
set
off
the
next
day
to
see
his
father
the
father
received
the
sons
communication
with
outward
calm
but
with
inner
spite
he
could
not
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
change
his
life
to
introduce
anything
new
into
it
when
for
him
life
was
already
over
only
let
me
live
out
my
life
as
i
want
and
then
they
can
do
what
they
want
the
old
man
said
to
himself
with
his
son
however
he
used
the
diplomacy
he
made
use
of
on
important
occasions
assuming
a
calm
tone
he
discussed
the
whole
matter
first
the
marriage
was
not
a
brilliant
one
in
terms
of
family
wealth
and
distinction
second
prince
andrei
was
not
in
his
early
youth
and
his
health
was
weak
the
old
man
especially
emphasized
that
while
she
was
very
young
third
there
was
his
son
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
hand
him
over
to
a
young
girl
fourth
and
finally
the
old
man
said
with
a
mocking
glance
at
his
son
i
beg
you
to
put
the
matter
off
for
a
year
go
abroad
take
a
cure
look
as
you
want
to
for
a
german
tutor
for
prince
nikolai
and
then
if
this
love
passion
obstinacy
call
it
whatever
you
like
is
so
great
you
can
marry
and
that
is
my
last
word
be
it
known
to
you
my
last
the
prince
concluded
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
nothing
would
make
him
change
his
decision
prince
andrei
saw
clearly
that
the
old
man
hoped
that
either
his
feeling
or
his
future
brides
would
not
endure
the
test
of
a
year
or
that
he
the
old
prince
would
die
himself
before
then
and
decided
to
do
his
fathers
will
to
propose
and
to
put
off
the
wedding
for
a
year
exactly
three
weeks
after
his
last
evening
at
the
rostovs
prince
andrei
returned
to
petersburg
the
day
after
her
talk
with
her
mother
natasha
waited
the
whole
day
for
bolkonsky
but
he
did
not
come
on
the
next
day
and
the
third
it
was
the
same
pierre
also
did
not
come
and
natasha
not
knowing
that
prince
andrei
had
gone
to
see
his
father
could
not
explain
his
absence
three
weeks
went
by
that
way
natasha
did
not
want
to
go
anywhere
and
like
a
shadow
idle
and
dejected
wandered
through
the
rooms
in
the
evenings
wept
in
secret
from
everybody
and
did
not
go
to
her
mother
she
blushed
constantly
and
was
irritable
it
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
knew
about
her
disappointment
was
laughing
at
her
and
pitied
her
with
all
the
strength
of
her
inner
grief
this
grief
of
vanity
intensified
her
unhappiness
one
day
she
came
to
the
countess
was
about
to
say
something
to
her
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
her
tears
were
the
tears
of
an
offended
child
who
does
not
know
why
it
is
being
punished
the
countess
began
to
calm
natasha
natasha
first
listened
to
her
mothers
words
then
suddenly
interrupted
her
stop
it
mama
im
not
thinking
and
i
dont
want
to
think
so
he
came
and
then
stopped
and
then
stopped
her
voice
trembled
she
almost
began
to
cry
but
controlled
herself
and
calmly
went
on
i
dont
want
to
get
married
at
all
and
im
afraid
of
him
im
calm
now
completely
calm
the
day
after
this
conversation
natasha
put
on
that
old
dress
which
was
especially
known
for
making
her
cheerful
in
the
mornings
and
with
that
morning
began
her
former
way
of
life
which
she
had
abandoned
since
the
ball
after
having
tea
she
went
to
the
reception
room
which
she
especially
liked
for
its
strong
resonance
and
began
to
sing
her
solfeggio
singing
exercises
having
finished
the
first
exercise
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
repeated
a
musical
phrase
which
she
especially
liked
she
listened
joyfully
as
if
it
was
unexpected
for
her
to
the
loveliness
with
which
these
sounds
rippling
filled
the
whole
emptiness
of
the
room
and
slowly
died
away
and
she
suddenly
felt
cheerful
why
think
much
about
it
things
are
good
as
it
is
she
said
to
herself
and
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
not
simply
stepping
on
the
resounding
parquet
but
beginning
each
step
on
the
heel
she
was
wearing
new
shoes
that
she
liked
then
going
onto
the
toe
and
listening
joyfully
as
she
had
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
to
the
rhythmic
stamping
of
the
heel
and
the
creaking
of
the
toe
going
past
a
mirror
she
looked
into
it
here
i
am
the
expression
of
her
face
seemed
to
say
at
the
sight
of
her
and
thats
good
i
dont
need
anybody
a
servant
wanted
to
come
in
to
straighten
something
in
the
room
but
she
did
not
let
him
in
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
went
back
to
her
walk
that
morning
she
returned
again
to
her
favorite
state
of
love
and
admiration
for
herself
how
lovely
that
natasha
is
she
said
of
herself
again
in
the
words
of
some
collective
male
third
person
pretty
a
good
voice
young
and
doesnt
bother
anybody
only
leave
her
in
peace
but
however
much
she
was
left
in
peace
she
could
no
longer
be
at
peace
and
she
felt
it
at
once
in
the
front
hall
the
outside
door
opened
someone
asked
are
they
at
home
and
someones
footsteps
were
heard
natasha
was
looking
in
the
mirror
but
did
not
see
herself
she
was
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
front
hall
when
she
did
see
herself
her
face
was
pale
it
was
he
she
knew
it
for
certain
though
she
had
barely
heard
the
sound
of
his
voice
through
the
closed
door
pale
and
frightened
natasha
ran
into
the
drawing
room
mama
bolkonskys
here
she
said
mama
its
terrible
its
unbearable
i
dont
wantto
suffer
what
am
i
to
do
before
the
countess
had
time
to
reply
prince
andrei
with
an
anxious
and
serious
face
came
into
the
drawing
room
as
soon
as
he
saw
natasha
his
face
lit
up
he
kissed
the
countesss
and
natashas
hand
and
sat
down
near
the
sofa
it
is
long
since
weve
had
the
pleasure
the
countess
began
but
prince
andrei
interrupted
her
answering
her
question
and
obviously
hurrying
to
say
what
he
had
to
i
havent
called
on
you
all
this
time
because
i
was
at
my
fathers
i
had
to
discuss
a
very
important
matter
i
came
back
only
last
night
he
said
glancing
at
natasha
i
must
talk
with
you
countess
he
added
after
a
moments
silence
the
countess
with
a
deep
sigh
lowered
her
eyes
i
am
at
your
service
she
said
natasha
knew
she
must
leave
but
she
could
not
do
it
something
clenched
her
throat
and
she
looked
at
prince
andrei
impolitely
directly
with
wideopen
eyes
now
this
minuteno
it
cant
be
she
thought
he
glanced
at
her
again
and
this
glance
convinced
her
that
she
was
not
mistaken
yes
her
fate
was
decided
now
this
minute
go
natasha
ill
call
you
the
countess
said
in
a
whisper
natasha
glanced
at
prince
andrei
and
her
mother
with
frightened
pleading
eyes
and
went
out
i
have
come
countess
to
ask
for
your
daughters
hand
said
prince
andrei
the
countesss
face
blushed
but
she
said
nothing
your
proposal
the
countess
began
gravely
he
was
silent
looking
into
her
eyes
your
proposal
she
became
embarrassed

pleasing
to
us
andi

your
proposal
i
am
glad

husband
tooi
hopebut
it
depends
on
her
ill

her
once
i
have
your
consentwill
you
give
it
to
me
asked
prince
andrei
yes
said
the
countess
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
alienation
and
tenderness
when
he
bent
over
her
hand
she
wished
to
love
him
as
a
son
but
she
felt
that
for
her
he
was
an
alien
and
frightening
man
im
sure
my
husband
will
consent
said
the
countess
but
your
father
my
father
whom
i
told
of
my
plans
made
it
an
absolute
condition
for
his
consent
that
the
marriage
not
take
place
for
a
year
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
said
prince
andrei
its
true
that
natasha
is
still
young
butso
long
it
cannot
be
otherwise
prince
andrei
said
with
a
sigh
ill
send
her
to
you
said
the
countess
and
she
left
the
room
lord
have
mercy
on
us
she
repeated
as
she
was
looking
for
her
daughter
sonya
said
that
natasha
was
in
her
bedroom
natasha
was
sitting
on
her
bed
pale
dryeyed
looking
at
the
icon
and
whispering
something
crossing
herself
quickly
seeing
her
mother
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
her
what
mamawhat
go
go
to
him
hes
asking
for
your
hand
the
countess
said
coldly
as
it
seemed
to
natashagogo
the
mother
said
sadly
and
reproachfully
after
her
running
daughter
and
she
sighed
deeply
natasha
did
not
remember
how
she
entered
the
drawing
room
going
through
the
door
and
seeing
him
she
stopped
can
it
be
that
this
stranger
has
now
become
everything
for
me
she
asked
herself
and
instantly
answered
yes
everything
he
alone
is
now
dearer
to
me
than
anything
in
the
world
prince
andrei
went
up
to
her
with
lowered
eyes
i
loved
you
the
moment
i
saw
you
may
i
hope
he
glanced
at
her
and
the
serious
passion
in
the
expression
of
her
face
struck
him
her
face
said
why
ask
why
doubt
what
you
cannot
help
knowing
why
speak
when
its
impossible
to
put
everything
you
feel
into
words
she
came
closer
to
him
and
stopped
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
do
you
love
me
yes
yes
natasha
said
as
if
with
vexation
sighed
loudly
then
again
and
again
and
burst
into
sobs
why
whats
the
matter
ah
im
so
happy
she
replied
smiling
through
her
tears
leaned
closer
to
him
thought
for
a
second
as
if
asking
herself
whether
she
could
and
kissed
him
prince
andrei
held
her
hand
looked
into
her
eyes
and
did
not
find
the
former
love
for
her
in
his
soul
something
suddenly
turned
over
in
his
soul
the
former
poetic
and
mysterious
delight
of
desire
was
not
there
but
there
was
pity
for
her
womans
and
childs
weakness
there
was
fear
before
her
devotion
and
trust
a
heavy
but
at
the
same
time
joyful
consciousness
of
duty
that
bound
him
to
her
forever
the
actual
feeling
though
not
as
bright
and
poetic
as
the
former
one
was
more
serious
and
strong
did
maman
tell
you
that
it
cant
be
sooner
than
in
a
year
prince
andrei
asked
still
looking
into
her
eyes
can
it
be
me
that
baby
girl
as
everybody
said
of
me
thought
natasha
can
it
be
that
from
this
moment
on
im
a
wife
equal
to
this
strange
dear
intelligent
man
whom
even
my
father
respects
can
it
be
true
can
it
be
true
that
now
there
is
to
be
no
more
toying
with
life
that
im
grown
up
now
that
responsibility
is
laid
upon
me
now
for
my
every
deed
and
word
ah
what
was
it
he
asked
me
no
she
replied
but
she
did
not
understand
what
he
was
asking
forgive
me
said
prince
andrei
but
youre
so
young
and
ive
already
experienced
so
much
of
this
life
i
fear
for
you
you
dont
know
yourself
natasha
listened
with
concentrated
attention
trying
to
understand
the
meaning
of
his
words
and
not
understanding
hard
as
this
year
that
postpones
my
happiness
will
be
for
me
prince
andrei
went
on
during
this
time
you
will
test
yourself
i
ask
you
to
make
me
happy
in
a
year
but
youre
free
our
engagement
will
remain
a
secret
and
if
you
become
convinced
that
you
dont
love
me
or
that
you
love
prince
andrei
said
with
an
unnatural
smile
why
are
you
saying
this
natasha
interrupted
him
you
know
ive
loved
you
from
the
very
day
you
first
came
to
otradnoe
she
said
firmly
convinced
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
in
a
year
you
will
know
yourself
a
whole
yeeear
natasha
said
suddenly
only
now
understanding
that
the
wedding
was
to
be
postponed
for
a
year
but
why
a
year
why
a
year
prince
andrei
began
to
explain
to
her
the
reasons
for
this
postponement
natasha
did
not
listen
to
him
and
it
cant
be
otherwise
she
asked
prince
andrei
said
nothing
but
his
face
expressed
the
impossibility
of
changing
this
decision
thats
terrible
no
its
terrible
terrible
natasha
said
suddenly
and
sobbed
again
ill
die
waiting
a
year
its
impossible
its
terrible
she
looked
into
her
fianc233s
face
and
saw
there
an
expression
of
compassion
and
bewilderment
no
no
ill
do
it
all
she
said
suddenly
stopping
her
tears
im
so
happy
her
father
and
mother
came
into
the
room
and
blessed
the
betrothed
couple
from
that
day
on
prince
andrei
began
going
to
the
rostovs
as
a
fianc233
xxiv
there
was
no
formal
betrothal
nor
was
anyone
told
of
the
engagement
of
bolkonsky
and
natasha
prince
andrei
insisted
on
that
he
said
that
as
he
was
the
cause
of
the
delay
he
must
bear
all
the
burden
of
it
he
said
that
he
had
forever
bound
himself
by
his
word
but
that
he
did
not
want
to
bind
natasha
and
gave
her
full
freedom
if
in
six
months
she
felt
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
would
be
within
her
rights
to
refuse
him
of
course
it
went
without
saying
that
neither
the
parents
nor
natasha
wanted
to
hear
about
it
but
prince
andrei
insisted
on
having
his
way
prince
andrei
came
to
the
rostovs
every
day
but
he
did
not
behave
like
a
fianc233
with
natasha
he
addressed
her
formally
and
kissed
only
her
hand
between
prince
andrei
and
natasha
after
the
day
of
the
proposal
close
and
simple
relations
were
established
quite
different
from
before
it
was
as
if
they
had
not
known
each
other
till
then
he
and
she
both
liked
to
remember
how
they
had
looked
at
each
other
when
they
were
still
nothing
now
they
both
felt
themselves
completely
different
beings
then
they
had
been
false
now
they
were
simple
and
sincere
at
first
there
was
a
feeling
of
awkwardness
in
the
family
in
dealing
with
prince
andrei
he
seemed
a
man
from
an
alien
world
and
natasha
spent
a
long
time
getting
the
household
accustomed
to
prince
andrei
and
proudly
assured
them
all
that
he
only
seemed
so
peculiar
but
that
he
was
the
same
as
everybody
else
and
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
that
no
one
should
be
afraid
of
him
after
a
few
days
the
family
got
used
to
him
and
without
restraint
carried
on
their
usual
way
of
life
in
which
he
participated
he
was
able
to
talk
about
estate
management
with
the
count
about
dresses
with
the
countess
and
natasha
about
albums
and
embroidery
with
sonya
occasionally
the
rostov
household
expressed
surprise
among
themselves
and
in
prince
andreis
presence
at
how
it
had
all
happened
and
how
obvious
the
portents
of
it
had
been
prince
andreis
coming
to
otradnoe
and
their
coming
to
petersburg
and
the
resemblance
between
natasha
and
prince
andrei
which
the
nanny
had
noticed
during
prince
andreis
first
visit
and
the
clash
between
andrei
and
nikolai
in
1805
and
many
other
portents
of
what
had
happened
were
noted
by
the
household
in
the
house
that
poetic
boredom
and
silence
reigned
which
always
accompanies
the
presence
of
an
engaged
couple
often
while
sitting
together
they
all
fell
silent
sometimes
they
all
got
up
and
left
and
the
couple
alone
together
were
still
just
as
silent
they
rarely
spoke
of
their
future
life
prince
andrei
was
afraid
and
embarrassed
to
speak
of
it
natasha
shared
that
feeling
as
she
did
all
his
feelings
which
she
invariably
guessed
once
natasha
began
to
ask
about
his
son
prince
andrei
blushed
which
often
happened
to
him
now
and
which
natasha
especially
liked
and
said
that
his
son
would
not
live
with
them
why
not
natasha
asked
in
alarm
i
cannot
take
him
from
his
grandfather
and
then
too
how
id
love
him
said
natasha
guessing
his
thought
at
once
but
i
know
you
want
there
to
be
no
pretexts
for
blaming
yourself
or
me
the
old
count
sometimes
went
up
to
prince
andrei
kissed
him
and
asked
his
advice
about
petyas
education
or
nikolais
service
the
old
countess
sighed
looking
at
them
sonya
feared
every
moment
to
be
in
the
way
and
tried
to
find
pretexts
for
leaving
them
alone
when
they
did
not
even
want
it
when
prince
andrei
spoke
he
was
a
very
good
storyteller
natasha
listened
to
him
with
pride
when
she
spoke
she
noticed
with
fear
and
joy
that
he
looked
at
her
attentively
and
searchingly
she
asked
herself
in
perplexity
what
is
he
looking
for
in
me
what
is
he
seeking
with
his
eyes
what
if
what
hes
looking
for
isnt
in
me
sometimes
she
got
into
her
wildly
merry
state
and
then
she
especially
liked
to
hear
and
see
how
prince
andrei
laughed
he
laughed
rarely
but
when
he
did
he
gave
himself
wholly
to
his
laughter
and
each
time
after
this
laughter
she
felt
closer
to
him
natasha
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
if
the
thought
of
the
imminent
and
approaching
separation
had
not
frightened
her
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
petersburg
prince
andrei
brought
along
pierre
who
had
not
once
been
to
the
rostovs
since
the
time
of
the
ball
pierre
looked
perplexed
and
embarrassed
he
was
talking
with
the
mother
natasha
sat
down
with
sonya
by
the
chess
table
thereby
inviting
prince
andrei
to
join
her
he
went
over
to
them
youve
known
bezukhov
for
a
long
time
havent
you
he
asked
do
you
like
him
yes
hes
nice
but
very
funny
and
as
always
when
she
spoke
of
pierre
she
began
telling
anecdotes
about
his
absentmindedness
anecdotes
which
had
even
been
made
up
about
him
you
know
ive
entrusted
him
with
our
secret
said
prince
andrei
ive
known
him
since
childhood
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
i
beg
you
natalie
he
suddenly
said
earnestly
im
going
away
god
knows
what
may
happen
you
may
stop
lovwell
i
know
i
mustnt
talk
about
that
one
thingwhatever
happens
with
you
while

not
here
whats
going
to
happen
whatever
misfortune
there
may
be
prince
andrei
went
on
i
beg
you
mademoiselle
sophie
whatever
may
happen
turn
to
him
alone
for
advice
and
help
hes
the
most
absentminded
and
ridiculous
man
but
he
has
a
heart
of
gold
neither
her
father
and
mother
nor
sonya
nor
prince
andrei
himself
could
have
foreseen
how
parting
with
her
fianc233
would
affect
natasha
flushed
and
agitated
her
eyes
dry
she
wandered
about
the
house
that
day
occupying
herself
with
the
most
insignificant
things
as
if
not
understanding
what
awaited
her
she
did
not
cry
when
at
the
moment
of
taking
leave
of
her
he
kissed
her
hand
for
the
last
time
dont
leave
was
all
she
said
to
him
in
a
voice
which
made
him
wonder
whether
he
ought
indeed
to
stay
and
which
he
remembered
long
afterwards
when
he
was
gone
she
also
did
not
cry
but
for
several
days
she
sat
not
crying
in
her
room
not
interested
in
anything
and
only
saying
from
time
to
time
ah
why
did
he
go
but
two
weeks
after
his
departure
just
as
unexpectedly
for
those
around
her
she
recovered
from
her
moral
illness
and
became
the
same
as
before
only
with
a
changed
moral
physiognomy
as
children
get
up
with
a
different
face
after
a
prolonged
illness
xxv
the
health
and
character
of
prince
nikolai
andreevich
bolkonsky
during
that
last
year
after
his
sons
departure
declined
considerably
he
became
still
more
irritable
than
before
and
all
the
outbursts
of
his
groundless
wrath
fell
mainly
upon
princess
marya
he
seemed
to
carefully
seek
out
all
her
sorest
spots
so
as
to
torment
her
morally
as
cruelly
as
possible
princess
marya
had
two
passions
and
therefore
two
joys
her
nephew
nikolushka
and
religionand
the
two
were
the
favorite
topics
of
the
princes
attacks
and
mockery
whatever
the
talk
was
about
he
always
brought
the
conversation
down
to
the
superstitions
of
old
maids
or
to
the
pampering
and
spoiling
of
children
you
want
to
make
nikolushka
into
an
old
maid
like
yourself
you
shouldnt
prince
andrei
needs
a
son
not
an
old
maid
he
would
say
or
turning
to
mlle
bourienne
he
would
ask
her
in
front
of
princess
marya
how
she
liked
our
priests
and
icons
and
would
joke
he
insulted
princess
marya
constantly
and
painfully
but
his
daughter
did
not
even
have
to
force
herself
to
forgive
him
how
could
he
be
guilty
before
her
and
how
could
her
father
who
she
knew
all
the
same
loved
her
be
unjust
to
her
and
what
is
justice
the
princess
never
thought
about
this
proud
word
justice
all
the
complicated
laws
of
mankind
were
concentrated
for
her
in
one
simple
and
clear
lawthe
law
of
love
and
selfdenial
taught
us
by
him
who
suffered
for
mankind
with
love
though
he
himself
was
god
what
did
the
justice
or
injustice
of
other
people
matter
to
her
she
herself
had
to
suffer
and
to
love
and
that
she
did
in
the
winter
prince
andrei
came
to
bald
hills
and
was
cheerful
meek
and
affectionate
as
princess
marya
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
she
sensed
that
something
had
happened
to
him
but
he
said
nothing
to
princess
marya
about
his
love
before
his
departure
prince
andrei
had
a
long
talk
about
something
with
his
father
and
princess
marya
noticed
that
before
his
departure
they
were
both
displeased
with
each
other
soon
after
prince
andreis
departure
princess
marya
wrote
to
petersburg
from
bald
hills
to
her
friend
julie
karagin
whom
princess
marya
had
dreamed
as
girls
always
do
of
marrying
to
her
brother
and
who
at
that
time
was
in
mourning
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
her
brother
killed
in
turkey
sorrows
are
clearly
our
common
lot
my
dear
and
tender
friend
julie
your
loss
is
so
terrible
that
i
cannot
explain
it
to
myself
otherwise
than
as
a
special
mercy
of
god
wholoving
youwants
to
test
you
and
your
excellent
mother
ah
my
friend
religion
and
religion
alone
cani
do
not
say
comfortbut
deliver
us
from
despair
religion
alone
can
explain
to
us
that
which
man
cannot
understand
without
its
help
wherefore
why
kind
and
lofty
beings
who
know
how
to
find
happiness
in
life
who
not
only
harm
no
one
but
are
necessary
for
the
happiness
of
others
are
called
to
god
while
the
evil
the
useless
the
harmful
or
such
as
are
a
burden
to
themselves
and
to
others
are
left
to
live
the
first
death
i
saw
which
i
will
never
forgetthe
death
of
my
dear
sisterinlawmade
that
impression
on
me
just
as
you
ask
fate
why
your
wonderful
brother
had
to
die
so
i
used
to
ask
why
this
angellizahad
to
die
who
not
only
did
no
wrong
to
anyone
but
never
had
anything
but
kind
thoughts
in
her
soul
and
what
then
my
friend
five
years
have
gone
by
and
i
with
my
small
mind
am
now
beginning
to
understand
clearly
why
she
had
to
die
and
in
what
way
this
death
was
the
expression
of
the
infinite
goodness
of
the
creator
all
of
whose
actions
though
for
the
most
do
not
understand
them
are
nothing
but
manifestations
of
his
infinite
love
for
his
creation
it
may
be
i
often
think
that
she
was
too
angelically
innocent
to
have
the
strength
to
bear
all
the
duties
of
a
mother
she
was
irreproachable
as
a
young
wife
perhaps
she
could
not
have
been
so
as
a
mother
now
she
has
not
only
left
us
and
prince
andrei
especially
with
the
purest
regret
and
memory
but
she
will
probably
obtain
there
the
place
which
i
dare
not
hope
for
myself
but
not
to
speak
only
of
her
this
early
and
terrible
death
despite
all
our
grieving
had
the
most
beneficent
influence
on
me
and
on
my
brother
then
at
the
moment
of
loss
these
thoughts
could
not
have
come
to
me
then
i
would
have
driven
them
away
with
horror
but
now
it
is
so
clear
and
unquestionable
i
am
writing
all
this
to
you
my
friend
only
so
as
to
convince
you
of
the
gospel
truth
that
has
become
lifes
truth
for
me
not
a
single
hair
will
fall
from
our
heads
without
his
will
and
his
will
is
guided
only
by
his
boundless
love
for
us
and
therefore
everything
that
happens
to
us
everything
is
for
our
own
good
you
ask
whether
we
shall
spend
next
winter
in
moscow
despite
all
my
wish
to
see
you
i
do
not
think
so
and
do
not
wish
to
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
reason
for
it
is
buonaparte
and
here
is
why
my
fathers
health
has
noticeably
declined
he
cannot
bear
to
be
contradicted
he
becomes
irritated
this
irritation
as
you
know
is
turned
mostly
towards
political
affairs
he
cannot
bear
the
thought
that
buonaparte
deals
as
an
equal
with
all
the
sovereigns
of
europe
and
especially
with
ours
the
grandson
of
the
great
catherine
as
you
know
i
am
totally
indifferent
to
political
affairs
but
from
my
fathers
words
and
from
his
conversations
with
mikhail
ivanovich
i
know
all
that
is
happening
in
the
world
and
especially
about
all
the
honors
rendered
buonaparte
who
it
seems
only
in
bald
hills
of
all
places
in
the
world
is
not
recognized
as
a
great
man
still
less
as
the
french
emperor
and
my
father
cannot
bear
that
it
seems
to
me
that
my
father
mostly
owing
to
his
view
of
political
affairs
and
foreseeing
the
clashes
he
will
have
owing
to
his
manner
of
voicing
his
opinions
without
any
restraint
is
reluctant
to
speak
of
going
to
moscow
all
that
he
gains
from
treatment
he
will
lose
owing
to
his
arguments
about
buonaparte
which
are
inevitable
in
any
case
this
will
be
decided
very
soon
our
family
life
goes
on
as
before
except
for
the
absence
of
my
brother
andrei
as
ive
already
written
to
you
he
has
changed
very
much
recently
after
his
grief
it
is
only
now
during
this
present
year
that
he
has
completely
revived
morally
he
has
become
the
way
i
knew
him
as
a
child
kind
affectionate
with
that
heart
of
gold
of
which
i
do
not
know
the
equal
he
has
understood
it
seems
to
me
that
his
life
is
not
over
but
along
with
this
moral
change
he
has
grown
very
weak
physically
he
has
become
thinner
than
before
more
nervous
i
fear
for
him
and
i
am
glad
he
has
undertaken
this
trip
abroad
which
the
doctors
prescribed
for
him
long
ago
i
hope
this
will
cure
him
you
write
me
that
he
is
spoken
of
in
petersburg
as
one
of
the
most
active
educated
and
intelligent
young
men
forgive
my
family
vanity
but
i
never
doubted
that
its
impossible
to
calculate
the
good
he
has
done
here
for
everyone
from
his
peasants
to
the
gentry
on
coming
to
petersburg
he
only
received
his
due
i
wonder
how
rumors
generally
get
from
petersburg
to
moscow
and
especially
such
false
ones
as
the
one
you
write
to
me
aboutthe
rumor
of
the
supposed
marriage
of
my
brother
to
the
little
rostov
girl
i
do
not
think
andrei
will
every
marry
anyone
and
especially
not
her
and
here
is
why
first
i
know
that
though
he
rarely
speaks
of
his
late
wife
the
grief
of
that
loss
is
too
deeply
rooted
in
his
heart
for
him
ever
to
decide
to
give
her
a
successor
and
a
stepmother
to
our
little
angel
second
because
as
far
as
i
know
this
girl
does
not
belong
at
all
to
the
category
that
could
please
prince
andrei
i
do
not
think
that
prince
andrei
would
choose
her
for
his
wife
and
i
will
tell
you
frankly
i
do
not
wish
it
but
i
am
babbling
away
coming
to
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
goodbye
my
dear
friend
may
god
keep
you
under
his
holy
and
mighty
protection
my
dear
friend
mlle
bourienne
kisses
you
marie
xxvi
in
the
middle
of
summer
princess
marya
received
an
unexpected
letter
from
prince
andrei
in
switzerland
with
a
strange
and
unexpected
piece
of
news
prince
andrei
announced
his
engagement
to
miss
rostov
his
whole
letter
breathed
a
loving
rapture
for
his
fianc233e
and
a
tender
friendship
and
trust
for
his
sister
he
wrote
that
he
had
never
loved
as
he
loved
now
and
that
only
now
did
he
know
and
understand
life
he
asked
his
sister
to
forgive
him
for
not
telling
her
of
this
decision
during
his
visit
to
bald
hills
though
he
had
spoken
of
it
with
his
father
he
had
not
told
her
of
it
because
princess
marya
would
have
asked
their
father
to
give
his
consent
and
without
achieving
that
goal
would
have
irritated
their
father
and
brought
upon
herself
the
whole
burden
of
his
displeasure
however
he
wrote
the
matter
had
not
been
as
finally
decided
then
as
it
was
now
then
father
appointed
me
a
years
term
and
now
six
months
half
the
appointed
term
have
gone
by
and
i
remain
as
firm
in
my
decision
as
ever
if
the
doctors
did
not
keep
me
here
at
the
spa
i
would
be
in
russia
myself
but
as
it
is
i
must
put
off
my
return
for
another
three
months
you
know
me
and
my
relations
with
father
i
need
nothing
from
him
i
am
and
always
will
be
independent
but
to
go
against
his
will
to
incur
his
wrath
when
he
will
perhaps
not
be
with
us
much
longer
would
spoil
half
my
happiness
i
am
now
writing
a
letter
to
him
about
the
same
thing
and
i
ask
you
to
choose
a
good
moment
to
give
him
the
letter
and
to
let
me
know
how
he
looks
at
it
all
and
whether
there
is
any
hope
that
he
will
agree
to
shorten
the
term
by
three
months
after
many
hesitations
doubts
and
prayers
princess
marya
gave
her
father
the
letter
the
next
day
the
old
prince
calmly
said
to
her
write
your
brother
that
he
should
wait
till
i
dieit
wont
be
longill
soon
unbind
him
the
princess
was
about
to
make
some
objection
but
her
father
did
not
let
her
and
began
raising
his
voice
more
and
more

he
turned
to
princess
marya
god
help
you
and
good
riddancegood
riddance
after
this
outburst
the
prince
never
once
spoke
of
the
matter
again
but
his
suppressed
vexation
with
his
sons
faintheartedness
showed
itself
in
the
relations
between
father
and
daughter
to
the
previous
subjects
of
mockery
a
new
one
was
addedtalk
about
stepmothers
and
his
amiability
towards
mlle
bourienne
why
shouldnt
i
marry
her
he
said
to
his
daughter
shed
make
a
nice
princess
and
lately
to
her
perplexity
and
astonishment
princess
marya
began
to
notice
that
her
father
had
indeed
become
more
and
more
intimate
with
the
frenchwoman
princess
marya
wrote
to
prince
andrei
about
how
their
father
had
taken
his
letter
but
she
comforted
her
brother
giving
him
hope
of
reconciling
their
father
to
the
thought
nikolushka
and
his
upbringing
andr233
and
religion
were
princess
maryas
comforts
and
joys
but
besides
that
since
every
human
being
needs
his
personal
hope
princess
marya
had
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
her
soul
a
hidden
dream
and
hope
which
provided
the
main
comfort
of
her
life
this
comforting
dream
and
hope
were
given
her
by
the
people
of
godthe
fools
for
christ
and
wanderers
who
visited
her
in
secret
from
the
old
prince
the
longer
princess
marya
lived
the
more
of
life
she
experienced
and
observed
the
more
astonished
she
was
at
the
shortsightedness
of
people
who
sought
pleasure
and
happiness
here
on
earth
who
worked
suffered
struggled
and
did
evil
to
each
other
to
achieve
this
impossible
illusory
and
fallacious
happiness
prince
andrei
loved
his
wife
she
dies
its
not
enough
for
him
he
wants
to
bind
up
his
happiness
with
another
woman
father
doesnt
want
it
because
he
wants
a
more
aristocratic
and
wealthy
marriage
for
andrei
and
they
all
struggle
and
suffer
and
torment
and
ruin
their
souls
their
eternal
souls
to
achieve
blessings
that
last
a
moment
not
only
do
we
know
it
ourselveschrist
the
son
of
god
came
down
to
earth
and
told
us
that
this
life
is
a
momentary
life
a
trial
yet
we
keep
holding
on
to
it
and
hope
to
find
happiness
in
it
how
is
it
no
one
understands
that
thought
princess
marya
no
one
except
these
contemptible
people
of
god
who
come
to
me
at
the
back
door
with
bags
over
their
shoulders
afraid
of
being
noticed
by
the
prince
not
because
they
would
suffer
from
him
but
so
as
not
to
lead
him
into
sin
to
leave
family
birthplace
all
cares
for
worldly
goods
so
as
to
walk
without
clinging
to
anything
in
coarse
rags
under
an
assumed
name
from
place
to
place
without
harming
people
and
praying
for
them
praying
for
those
who
persecute
and
for
those
who
protect
there
is
no
truth
and
life
higher
than
this
truth
and
life
there
was
one
woman
wanderer
fedosyushka
a
fiftyyearold
small
quiet
pockmarked
woman
who
had
been
walking
barefoot
and
in
chains
for
thirty
years
already
princess
marya
had
a
special
love
for
her
once
when
in
the
dark
room
by
the
light
of
the
icon
lamp
fedosyushka
was
telling
about
her
life
the
thought
that
fedosyushka
alone
had
found
the
right
way
of
life
suddenly
came
to
princess
marya
with
such
force
that
she
herself
decided
to
go
wandering
when
fedosyushka
went
to
bed
princess
marya
thought
about
it
for
a
long
time
and
finally
decided
that
however
strange
it
was
she
had
to
become
a
wanderer
she
confided
her
intention
only
to
her
father
confessor
the
monk
akinfy
and
the
monk
approved
of
it
under
the
pretext
of
a
gift
for
the
wanderers
princess
marya
provided
herself
with
a
full
wanderers
outfit
a
shirt
bast
shoes
a
kaftan
and
a
black
kerchief
often
going
to
the
secret
chest
princess
marya
would
pause
unable
to
decide
whether
the
time
had
come
to
fulfill
her
intention
often
listening
to
the
stories
of
the
women
wanderers
she
would
become
excited
by
their
simple
talk
mechanical
for
them
but
full
of
deep
meaning
for
her
so
that
several
times
she
had
been
ready
to
drop
everything
and
flee
the
house
in
her
imagination
she
already
saw
herself
and
fedosyushka
in
coarse
rags
walking
with
a
stick
and
a
bag
down
a
dusty
road
guiding
her
wandering
without
envy
without
love
of
human
things
without
desires
from
one
holy
place
to
another
and
in
the
end
to
the
place
where
there
is
no
sorrow
or
sighing
but
eternal
joy
and
bliss
ill
come
to
one
place
and
pray
before
i
have
time
to
get
used
to
it
and
love
it
ill
go
on
and
ill
keep
going
until
my
legs
give
out
and
i
lie
down
and
die
somewhere
and
come
finally
to
that
eternal
quiet
haven
where
there
is
no
sorrow
or
sighing
thought
princess
marya
but
then
seeing
her
father
and
especially
little
coco
her
intention
would
weaken
she
would
weep
in
quiet
and
feel
she
was
a
sinful
woman
she
loved
her
father
and
her
nephew
more
than
god
i
biblical
tradition
says
that
absence
of
workidlenesswas
the
condition
of
the
first
mans
blessedness
before
his
fall
the
love
of
idleness
remained
the
same
in
fallen
man
but
the
curse
still
weighs
on
man
and
not
only
because
we
must
win
our
bread
in
the
sweat
of
our
face
but
because
our
moral
qualities
are
such
that
we
are
unable
to
be
idle
and
at
peace
a
secret
voice
tells
us
that
we
should
feel
guilty
for
being
idle
if
man
could
find
a
condition
in
which
while
idle
he
felt
that
he
was
being
useful
and
was
fulfilling
his
duty
he
would
have
found
one
side
of
primordial
blessedness
and
this
state
of
obligatory
and
irreproachable
idleness
is
enjoyed
by
an
entire
classthe
military
in
this
obligatory
and
irreproachable
idleness
consists
and
will
consist
the
chief
attraction
of
military
service
nikolai
rostov
experienced
this
blessedness
to
the
full
as
he
continued
serving
after
1807
in
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
where
he
was
already
a
squadron
commander
having
taken
over
from
denisov
rostov
had
become
a
bluff
goodnatured
fellow
whom
his
moscow
acquaintances
would
have
found
slightly
mauvais
genre
but
who
was
loved
and
respected
by
his
comrades
subordinates
and
superiors
and
who
was
content
with
his
life
latelythat
is
in
1809in
letters
from
home
he
often
found
complaints
from
his
mother
that
their
affairs
were
falling
into
worse
and
worse
disorder
and
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
come
home
to
bring
joy
and
peace
to
his
old
parents
reading
these
letters
nikolai
experienced
a
fear
that
they
wanted
to
make
him
leave
the
milieu
in
which
he
lived
calmly
and
peacefully
protected
from
lifes
confusion
he
felt
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
enter
the
deep
water
of
life
again
with
its
affairs
disordered
and
straightened
out
with
its
stewards
accounts
with
its
quarrels
intrigues
connections
with
its
society
with
sonyas
love
and
his
promise
to
her
all
this
was
terribly
difficult
confused
and
he
answered
his
mothers
letters
with
cold
classical
ones
that
began
ma
ch232re
maman
and
ended
votre
ob233issant
fils
and
omitted
saying
when
he
intended
to
return
in
1810
he
received
letters
from
his
parents
in
which
they
informed
him
of
natashas
engagement
to
bolkonsky
and
that
the
wedding
would
take
place
in
a
year
because
the
old
prince
was
against
it
this
letter
upset
and
insulted
nikolai
first
of
all
he
felt
sorry
that
natasha
whom
he
loved
most
of
all
in
the
family
would
be
leaving
home
second
from
his
hussar
point
of
view
he
was
sorry
he
was
not
there
to
show
this
bolkonsky
that
connection
with
him
was
by
no
means
so
great
an
honor
and
that
if
he
loved
natasha
he
could
do
without
the
permission
of
his
crackbrained
father
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
whether
he
should
not
ask
for
a
leave
in
order
to
see
natasha
as
a
fianc233e
but
then
came
maneuvers
considerations
about
sonya
about
the
confusion
and
nikolai
put
it
off
again
but
in
the
spring
of
that
year
he
received
a
letter
from
his
mother
written
in
secret
from
the
count
and
this
letter
persuaded
him
to
go
she
wrote
that
if
nikolai
did
not
come
and
take
things
in
hand
their
property
would
be
sold
at
auction
and
they
would
all
go
begging
the
count
was
so
weak
so
trusting
in
mitenka
and
so
kind
and
everyone
deceived
him
so
that
it
was
all
getting
worse
and
worse
for
gods
sake
i
beg
you
come
at
once
if
you
dont
want
to
make
me
and
your
whole
family
miserable
wrote
the
countess
this
letter
made
an
impression
on
nikolai
he
had
that
common
sense
of
mediocrity
which
told
him
what
he
ought
to
do
now
he
ought
to
go
if
not
into
retirement
then
at
least
on
leave
why
he
had
to
go
he
did
not
know
but
having
slept
after
dinner
he
gave
orders
to
saddle
his
gray
mars
a
long
unridden
and
terribly
illtempered
stallion
and
returning
home
with
the
stallion
all
in
a
lather
he
announced
to
lavrushka
denisovs
footman
who
had
remained
with
rostov
and
the
comrades
who
came
in
the
evening
that
he
was
taking
a
leave
and
going
home
difficult
and
strange
as
it
was
for
him
to
think
that
he
would
go
without
having
learned
from
staff
what
especially
interested
himwhether
he
was
to
be
promoted
to
captain
or
get
an
anna
for
the
last
maneuvers
strange
as
it
was
to
think
that
he
would
go
without
selling
to
count
goluchowski
a
troika
of
grays
that
the
polish
count
wanted
to
buy
and
that
rostov
had
bet
he
could
sell
for
two
thousand
incomprehensible
as
it
seemed
that
he
would
not
be
at
the
ball
the
hussars
were
to
give
for
panna
przazdiecka
to
spite
the
uhlans
who
were
giving
a
ball
for
their
panna
borzozowskahe
knew
that
he
had
to
go
from
this
clear
good
world
to
somewhere
where
everything
was
nonsense
and
confusion
a
week
later
the
leave
came
through
the
hussars
his
comrades
not
only
of
the
regiment
but
of
the
brigade
gave
rostov
a
subscription
dinner
that
cost
them
fifteen
roubles
eachtwo
bands
played
two
choruses
sang
songs
rostov
danced
the
trepak
with
major
basov
drunken
officers
tossed
embraced
and
dropped
rostov
the
soldiers
of
the
third
squadron
also
tossed
him
and
shouted
hurrah
then
rostov
was
laid
in
a
sleigh
and
accompanied
to
the
first
posting
station
for
half
the
journey
as
always
happens
from
kremenchug
to
kiev
all
rostovs
thoughts
still
lay
behind
him
in
his
squadron
but
having
passed
the
midpoint
he
began
to
forget
the
troika
of
grays
his
sergeant
major
and
panna
borzozowska
and
began
asking
himself
uneasily
what
he
would
find
at
otradnoe
and
how
it
would
be
the
closer
he
came
the
more
strongly
far
more
strongly
as
if
moral
feeling
was
also
subject
to
the
law
of
attraction
which
increases
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
he
thought
of
his
home
at
the
last
station
before
otradnoe
he
gave
the
driver
three
roubles
for
vodka
and
soon
breathless
as
a
boy
was
running
up
the
front
porch
of
the
house
after
the
raptures
of
the
meeting
and
after
that
strange
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
compared
with
what
one
expected
its
all
just
the
same
why
was
i
hurrying
so
nikolai
began
to
live
his
way
into
his
old
world
of
home
his
father
and
mother
were
the
same
only
a
little
older
what
was
new
in
them
was
a
sort
of
anxiety
and
sometimes
disagreement
which
had
never
happened
before
and
which
as
nikolai
soon
learned
came
from
the
bad
state
of
their
affairs
sonya
was
already
going
on
twenty
she
had
already
stopped
growing
prettier
nothing
more
was
promised
than
what
was
there
but
even
that
was
enough
she
breathed
out
happiness
and
love
from
the
moment
nikolai
arrived
and
the
faithful
unshakeable
love
of
this
girl
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
him
petya
and
natasha
surprised
nikolai
most
petya
was
now
a
big
handsome
thirteenyearold
boy
merry
and
wittily
mischievous
whose
voice
was
already
breaking
as
for
natasha
nikolai
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
wondering
and
laughing
not
her
at
all
he
said
what
worse
on
the
contrary
but
theres
a
sort
of
dignity
a
princess
he
said
to
her
in
a
whisper
yes
yes
yes
natasha
said
joyfully
natasha
told
him
about
her
romance
with
prince
andrei
his
visit
to
otradnoe
and
showed
him
his
last
letter
well
are
you
glad
aked
natasha
im
so
calm
and
happy
now
very
glad
nikolai
replied
hes
an
excellent
man
well
are
you
very
much
in
love
how
shall
i
tell
you
natasha
replied
i
was
in
love
with
boris
with
my
teacher
with
denisov
but
this
is
not
the
same
at
all
i
feel
peaceful
firm
i
know
that
theres
no
one
better
than
he
and
i
feel
so
calm
so
good
now
not
at
all
like
before
nikolai
expressed
his
displeasure
at
the
wedding
being
put
off
for
a
year
but
natasha
fiercely
attacked
her
brother
proving
to
him
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
that
it
would
be
bad
to
enter
the
family
against
the
fathers
will
that
she
herself
wanted
it
that
way
you
dont
understand
at
all
not
at
all
she
said
nikolai
fell
silent
and
agreed
with
her
her
brother
often
wondered
looking
at
her
it
did
not
seem
at
all
as
if
she
was
a
loving
fianc233e
separated
from
her
future
husband
she
was
levelheaded
calm
altogether
as
cheerful
as
before
this
surprised
nikolai
and
it
even
made
him
look
mistrustfully
at
this
alliance
with
bolkonsky
he
did
not
believe
that
her
fate
was
already
decided
the
less
so
as
he
had
not
seen
her
together
with
prince
andrei
he
kept
thinking
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
projected
marriage
why
the
postponement
why
no
betrothal
he
thought
talking
with
his
mother
once
about
his
sister
he
found
to
his
surprise
and
partly
to
his
satisfaction
that
deep
in
her
heart
his
mother
also
sometimes
looked
mistrustfully
at
this
marriage
here
he
writes
she
said
showing
her
son
prince
andreis
letter
with
that
hidden
feeling
of
illwill
a
mother
always
has
against
her
daughters
future
marital
happiness
he
writes
that
he
wont
come
before
december
what
can
be
keeping
him
it
must
be
illness
his
health
is
very
weak
dont
tell
natasha
never
mind
her
cheerfulness
shes
living
out
the
last
of
her
girlhood
but
i
know
what
happens
to
her
each
time
a
letter
comes
from
him
but
anyhow
god
willing
all
will
be
well
she
concluded
each
time
hes
an
excellent
man
ii
in
the
initial
time
of
his
visit
nikolai
was
serious
and
even
dull
he
suffered
from
the
impending
necessity
of
intervening
in
these
stupid
matters
of
estate
management
for
which
his
mother
had
summoned
him
to
get
the
burden
off
his
shoulders
on
the
third
day
of
his
visit
angry
scowling
not
answering
natashas
question
of
where
he
was
going
he
went
to
the
wing
to
see
mitenka
and
demanded
a
full
accounting
from
him
what
this
full
accounting
was
nikolai
knew
still
less
than
the
frightened
and
bewildered
mitenka
the
conversation
and
the
accounting
with
mitenka
did
not
last
long
the
headman
the
delegate
and
the
village
clerk
who
were
waiting
in
the
front
hall
of
the
wing
listened
at
first
with
fear
and
satisfaction
to
the
sound
of
the
young
counts
rapping
voice
rising
higher
and
higher
pouring
out
terrible
and
abusive
words
one
after
another
robber
ungrateful
creaturecut
you
to
pieces
like
a
dognot
dealing
with
papathieveryracaille
then
the
same
people
with
undiminished
satisfaction
and
fear
saw
how
the
young
count
all
red
with
bloodshot
eyes
dragged
mitenka
out
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
chose
a
convenient
moment
between
his
words
applied
foot
and
knee
with
great
deftness
to
his
rear
end
and
shouted
out
scoundrel
and
dont
leave
a
trace
behind
mitenka
flew
headlong
down
the
six
steps
and
ran
off
into
the
flower
garden
this
flower
garden
was
a
wellknown
place
of
refuge
for
wrongdoers
in
otradnoe
mitenka
himself
when
coming
back
drunk
from
town
hid
in
this
flower
garden
and
many
inhabitants
of
otradnoe
hiding
from
mitenka
knew
the
saving
power
of
this
flower
garden
mitenkas
wife
and
sistersinlaw
stuck
their
frightened
faces
into
the
front
hall
from
the
door
to
their
room
where
a
clean
samovar
was
boiling
and
the
stewards
bed
rose
up
high
under
its
patchwork
quilt
the
young
count
breathless
paying
no
attention
to
them
walked
by
with
resolute
strides
and
went
into
the
house
the
countess
learning
at
once
through
the
maids
of
what
had
happened
in
the
wing
was
on
the
one
hand
calmed
by
the
reflection
that
their
situation
should
now
be
set
to
rights
but
on
the
other
hand
was
troubled
by
the
thought
of
how
her
son
would
put
up
with
it
she
tiptoed
to
his
door
several
times
listening
as
he
smoked
one
pipe
after
another
the
next
day
the
old
count
called
his
son
aside
and
told
him
with
a
timid
smile
you
know
dear
heart
you
neednt
have
flown
into
a
temper
mitenka
has
told
me
everything
i
knew
thought
nikolai
that
id
never
understand
anything
here
in
this
foolish
world
you
got
angry
that
he
hadnt
written
down
those
seven
hundred
roubles
but
he
had
carried
them
over
and
you
didnt
look
at
the
next
page
papa
hes
a
blackguard
and
a
thief
i
know
it
whats
done
is
done
but
if
you
dont
want
it
i
wont
say
anything
to
him
no
dear
heart
the
count
was
also
embarrassed
he
felt
he
had
managed
his
wifes
estate
poorly
and
was
guilty
before
his
children
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
set
things
to
rights
no
i
ask
you
to
take
care
of
things
im
old
i
no
papa
forgive
me
if
ive
caused
you
unpleasantness
im
less
capable
than
you
are
devil
take
them
these
muzhiks
and
money
and
carrying
over
to
the
next
page
he
thought
i
used
to
understand
something
about
doubling
on
a
sixcard
run
but
about
carrying
over
on
pages
i
know
nothing
he
said
to
himself
and
from
then
on
he
did
not
enter
into
the
business
anymore
only
once
the
countess
summoned
her
son
informed
him
that
she
had
a
promissory
note
for
two
thousand
from
anna
mikhailovna
and
asked
nikolai
how
he
thought
of
acting
upon
it
heres
how
nikolai
replied
you
told
me
it
depends
on
me
i
dont
like
anna
mikhailovna
and
i
dont
like
boris
but
theyve
been
our
friends
and
theyre
poor
so
heres
how
and
he
tore
up
the
note
and
this
action
caused
the
old
countess
to
burst
into
tears
of
joy
after
that
the
young
rostov
not
entering
into
such
business
anymore
with
passionate
enthusiasm
took
up
the
occupation
new
for
him
of
hunting
with
dogs
which
the
old
count
managed
on
a
grand
scale
iii
it
was
already
turning
winter
morning
frosts
gripped
the
earth
moistened
by
autumn
rains
the
winter
wheat
was
already
tufting
up
and
stood
out
bright
green
against
the
strips
of
brownish
cattletrampled
winter
stubble
and
pale
yellow
summer
stubble
with
red
strips
of
buckwheat
the
hilltops
and
woods
which
at
the
end
of
august
were
still
green
islands
among
the
black
winter
croplands
and
stubble
had
become
golden
and
bright
red
islands
amidst
the
bright
green
winter
crops
the
hares
had
already
half
shed
their
summer
coats
the
fox
cubs
were
beginning
to
disperse
and
the
young
wolves
were
bigger
than
dogs
it
was
the
best
time
for
hunting
the
dogs
of
the
ardent
young
hunter
rostov
had
not
only
reached
good
hunting
form
but
were
so
footsore
that
at
a
general
council
of
hunters
it
was
decided
to
give
the
dogs
a
threeday
rest
and
move
off
on
the
sixteenth
of
september
beginning
in
oak
grove
where
there
was
an
intact
family
of
wolves
this
was
where
things
stood
on
the
fourteenth
of
september
all
that
day
the
hunt
stayed
at
home
it
was
frosty
and
biting
but
in
the
evening
it
became
overcast
and
turned
warmer
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
when
young
rostov
in
his
dressing
gown
glanced
out
the
window
in
the
morning
he
saw
a
morning
than
which
nothing
could
be
better
for
hunting
it
was
as
if
the
sky
was
melting
and
without
wind
descending
to
earth
the
only
movement
in
the
air
was
the
slow
movement
from
above
to
below
of
descending
microscopic
drops
of
mist
or
fog
transparent
drops
hung
on
the
bare
branches
of
the
garden
and
dripped
onto
the
justfallen
leaves
the
soil
in
the
kitchen
garden
glistening
wet
and
black
as
poppy
seed
merged
in
the
near
distance
with
the
dull
and
damp
curtain
of
the
mist
nikolai
went
out
to
the
wet
mudtracked
porch
there
was
a
smell
of
fading
leaves
and
dogs
the
blackspotted
broadhaunched
bitch
milka
with
big
black
bulging
eyes
seeing
her
master
got
up
stretched
her
hind
legs
and
lay
down
harelike
then
suddenly
jumped
up
and
licked
him
right
on
the
nose
and
mustache
another
borzoi
seeing
his
master
from
the
garden
path
rushed
headlong
arching
his
back
towards
the
porch
and
raising
his
stern
tail
began
to
rub
himself
against
nikolais
legs
halloo
just
then
came
that
inimitable
hunting
call
which
unites
in
itself
the
deepest
bass
and
the
highest
tenor
and
around
the
corner
came
the
head
kennelman
and
huntsman
danilo
a
wrinkled
old
hunter
his
gray
hair
cut
round
in
ukrainian
fashion
a
hooked
hunting
whip
in
his
hand
and
with
that
expression
of
independence
and
scorn
for
everything
in
the
world
that
only
hunters
have
he
took
off
his
circassian
hat
before
his
master
and
looked
at
him
scornfully
this
scorn
was
not
offensive
for
the
master
nikolai
knew
that
this
danilo
who
scorned
everything
and
was
above
everything
was
still
his
serf
and
his
hunter
danilo
said
nikolai
timidly
sensing
that
at
the
sight
of
this
hunting
weather
these
dogs
and
his
hunter
he
was
already
being
seized
by
that
irresistible
hunting
feeling
in
which
a
man
forgets
all
his
former
intentions
like
a
lovesick
man
in
the
presence
of
his
beloved
what
orders
your
excellency
asked
a
protodeacons
bass
hoarse
from
hallooing
and
two
black
brilliant
eyes
looked
from
under
their
brows
at
the
silent
master
so
you
cant
stand
it
these
two
eyes
seemed
to
say
a
pretty
nice
day
eh
for
a
chase
and
a
gallop
eh
said
nikolai
scratching
milka
behind
the
ears
danilo
did
not
reply
and
blinked
his
eyes
i
sent
uvarka
to
listen
at
dawn
his
bass
said
after
a
moments
silence
he
says
she
transferred
them
to
the
otradnoe
reserve
they
were
howling
there
transferred
meant
that
the
shewolf
they
both
knew
about
had
gone
with
her
cubs
to
the
otradnoe
woods
which
was
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
house
and
was
a
small
preserve
weve
got
to
go
then
said
nikolai
meet
me
here
with
uvarka
as
you
say
sir
and
hold
off
the
feeding
yes
sir
five
minutes
later
danilo
and
uvarka
were
standing
in
nikolais
big
study
though
danilo
was
of
small
stature
seeing
him
in
the
room
produced
an
impression
similar
to
seeing
a
horse
or
a
bear
standing
there
amidst
the
furniture
and
accessories
of
human
life
danilo
felt
it
himself
and
as
usual
stayed
near
the
door
trying
to
speak
softly
not
moving
so
as
not
to
break
anything
somehow
in
his
masters
room
and
trying
to
say
everything
as
quickly
as
possible
and
get
out
into
the
open
from
under
the
ceiling
to
under
the
sky
having
finished
his
questioning
and
extorted
from
danilo
the
admission
that
the
dogs
were
all
right
danilo
himself
wanted
to
go
nikolai
ordered
the
horses
saddled
but
danilo
was
just
about
to
leave
when
natasha
not
yet
dressed
her
hair
still
undone
in
her
nannys
big
shawl
came
into
the
room
with
quick
steps
petya
ran
in
with
her
youre
going
said
natasha
i
just
knew
it
sonya
said
you
wouldnt
i
knew
that
on
a
day
like
this
you
couldnt
help
going
were
going
nikolai
answered
reluctantly
being
intent
on
some
serious
wolf
hunting
that
day
and
not
wanting
to
bring
natasha
and
petya
along
were
going
but
only
for
wolves
youd
be
bored
you
know
its
my
greatest
pleasure
said
natasha

ordered
the
horses

and
you

told

petya
but

natasha

natasha
said
resolutely
danilo
order
horses
saddled
for
us
and
have
mikhailo
ride
out
with
my
pack
she
turned
to
the
huntsman
and
if
being
in
the
room
like
that
seemed
improper
and
burdensome
to
danilo
having
any
sort
of
dealings
with
a
young
lady
seemed
simply
impossible
to
him
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
hurried
out
as
if
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
trying
not
to
injure
the
young
lady
somehow
accidentally
iv
the
old
count
who
had
always
maintained
an
enormous
hunt
having
now
handed
the
whole
hunt
over
to
his
sons
keeping
on
that
day
of
the
fifteenth
of
september
feeling
quite
cheered
up
made
ready
to
go
with
them
an
hour
later
the
entire
hunt
was
at
the
porch
nikolai
with
a
stern
and
serious
air
showing
that
it
was
no
time
for
bothering
with
trifles
walked
past
natasha
and
petya
as
they
were
telling
him
something
he
examined
all
parts
of
the
hunt
sent
a
pack
and
some
hunters
ahead
to
circle
around
mounted
his
chestnut
don
stallion
and
whistling
up
the
dogs
of
his
pack
set
out
across
the
threshing
floor
to
the
field
leading
to
the
otradnoe
reserve
the
old
counts
horse
a
sorrel
gelding
named
viflyanka
was
led
by
the
counts
groom
the
count
himself
was
to
drive
directly
to
the
covert
assigned
to
him
in
a
little
droshky
in
all
fiftyfour
hounds
were
led
out
under
six
kennelmen
and
whippersin
besides
the
gentlemen
there
were
eight
borzoi
handlers
around
whom
roamed
more
than
forty
borzois
so
that
with
the
gentlemens
packs
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
dogs
in
the
field
and
twenty
mounted
hunters
each
dog
knew
its
master
and
its
name
each
hunter
knew
his
task
place
and
purpose
as
soon
as
they
went
beyond
the
fence
everybody
with
no
noise
or
talk
spread
out
evenly
and
calmly
along
the
road
and
field
leading
to
the
otradnoe
woods
as
over
a
plush
carpet
the
horses
walked
over
the
field
splashing
in
puddles
now
and
then
as
they
crossed
the
roads
the
misty
sky
went
on
imperceptibly
and
evenly
descending
to
earth
the
air
was
still
warm
soundless
now
and
then
came
the
whistle
of
a
hunter
the
snort
of
a
horse
the
crack
of
a
whip
or
the
squeal
of
a
hound
strayed
from
its
place
they
had
not
yet
ridden
a
mile
when
the
rostov
hunt
was
met
by
another
five
riders
with
dogs
emerging
from
the
mist
at
their
head
rode
a
fresh
handsome
old
man
with
big
gray
mustaches

shawls
from
which
her
lively
face
peeked
out
with
its
bright
eyes
galloped
up
to
them
accompanied
by
petya
who
never
left
her
side
and
mikhailo
a
hunter
and
riding

and
whipped
and
pulled
his
horse
natasha
adroitly
and
confidently
sat
her
black
arabchik
and
with
a
sure
hand
effortlessly
reined
him
in
the
uncle

disapprovingly
at
petya
and
natasha
he
did
not

with
the
serious
business
of
hunting

nikolai
and
he
glanced
sternly
at
his
sister
trying
to
make
her
feel
the
distance
that
should
separate
them
at
that
moment
natasha
understood
it

on
with
the
island
of
the
otradnoe
reserve
could
be
seen
about
two
hundred
yards
away
and
the
kennelmen
were
approaching
it
rostov
having
come
to
a
final
decision
with
the
uncle
about
where
to
set
on
the
hounds
and
pointing
natasha
to
a
place
where
she
could
stand
and
where
nothing
could
ever
run
out
he
went
to
circle
around
above
the
ravine

for

everybody
took
their
places
the
old
count
knowing
his
sons
hunting
ardor
hurried
so
as
not
to
be
late
and
before
the
kennelmen
managed
to
reach
their
places
ilya
andreich
merry
redcheeked
with
quivering
jowls
drove
up
with
his
black
horses
across
the
green
winter
wheat
to
the
covert
left
for
him
and
having
straightened
his
fur
jacket
and
put
on
his
hunting
gear
mounted
his
sleek
wellfed
placid
and
kind
viflyanka
gone
as
gray
as
himself
the
horses
and
droshky
were
sent
away
count
ilya
andreich
who
though
not
a
hunter
at
heart
had
a
firm
knowledge
of
the
rules
of
hunting
rode
to
the
edge
of
the
bushes
where
he
was
to
stand
straightened
out
the
reins
settled
in
the
saddle
and
feeling
himself
ready
looked
around
smiling
next
to
him
stood
his
valet
semyon
chekmar
an
old
horseman
now
grown
heavy
in
the
saddle
chekmar
held
in
leash
three
wolfhounds
spirited
but
grown
fat
like
their
master
and
his
horse
two
clever
old
dogs
lay
down
without
a
leash
a
hundred
paces
away
inside
the
edge
of
the
woods
stood
the
counts
other
groom
mitka
a
desperate
horseman
and
passionate
hunter
the
count
by
ancient
habit
drank
a
silver
tumbler
of
hunters
spiced
brandy
had
a
bite
to
eat
and
washed
it
down
with
half
a
bottle
of
his
favorite
bordeaux
ilya
andreevich
was
slightly
flushed
from
the
wine
and
the
driving
his
eyes
veiled
with
moisture
had
a
special
glitter
and
wrapped
in
his
fur
coat
sitting
in
his
saddle
he
had
the
look
of
a
child
made
ready
to
go
for
a
walk
the
thin
hollowcheeked
chekmar
having
set
everything
up
for
himself
kept
glancing
at
his
master
with
whom
he
had
lived
in
perfect
harmony
for
thirty
years
and
understanding
his
pleasant
state
of
mind
expected
some
pleasant
conversation
a
third
person
also
rode
up
cautiously
clearly
he
had
already
learned
his
lesson
from
beyond
the
woods
and
stopped
behind
the
count
this
person
was
an
old
graybearded
man
in
a
womans
coat
and
tall
hat
he
was
the
buffoon
nastasya
ivanovna
well

nastasya

asked

a
whisper

fine
knowledge
of

master

how

eh
a
real
picture
like
the
other
day
when
we
chased
a
fox
from
the
zavarzinsky
thicket
the
master
went
hurtling
to
cut
it
off
from
the
forest
something
fearsomea
thousandrouble
horse
but
the
riders
priceless
yes
a
fine
fellow
like
that
is
hard
to
find
hard
to
find
repeated
the
count
obviously
sorry
that
semyon
had
stopped
talking
so
soon
hard
to
find
he
said
pulling
back
the
skirt
of
his
jacket
and
taking
out
his
snuffbox
the
other
day
when
he
came
out
of
church
in
full
regalia
mikhail
sidorych
semyon
did
not
finish
hearing
in
the
still
air
the
clear
music
of
no
more
than
two
or
three
hounds
baying
in
pursuit
inclining
his
head
he
listened
and
frowned
silently
to
his
master
theyve
struck
on
the
litter
he
whispered
theyre
heading
straight
for
the
lyadovsky
knoll
the
count
forgetting
to
wipe
the
smile
from
his
face
looked
straight
into
the
distance
along
the
line
of
trees
and
held
the
snuffbox
in
his
hand
without
taking
a
pinch
following
the
dogs
barking
came
the
bass
sound
of
danilos
horn
calling
after
the
wolf
the
pack
joined
the
first
three
dogs
and
one
could
hear
the
baying
of
the
hounds
in
full
cry
with
that
special
yelping
that
signals
the
pursuit
of
a
wolf
the
kennelmen
no
longer
shouted
but
hallooed
and
danilos
voice
rose
above
all
the
others
now
bass
now
piercingly
shrill
danilos
voice
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
woods
emerge
and
spread
far
across
the
field
listening
silently
for
a
few
seconds
the
count
and
his
groom
realized
that
the
hounds
had
broken
up
into
two
packs
one
a
big
one
baying
with
particular
fervor
began
to
move
away
the
other
the
pack
raced
through
the
woods
past
the
count
and
in
this
pack
danilos
hallooing
could
be
heard
these
two
chases
merged
alternated
but
both
were
moving
away
semyon
sighed
and
bent
down
to
straighten
the
leash
in
which
a
young
dog
had
become
entangled
the
count
also
sighed
and
noticing
the
snuffbox
in
his
hand
opened
it
and
took
a
pinch
back
semyon
shouted
at
a
dog
that
had
stepped
out
of
the
bushes
the
count
gave
a
start
and
dropped
the
snuffbox
nastasya
ivanovna
dismounted
and
went
to
pick
it
up
the
count
and
semyon
looked
at
him
suddenly
as
often
happens
the
sound
of
the
chase
instantly
drew
close
as
if
the
dogs
baying
muzzles
and
danilos
hallooing
were
just
in
front
of
them
the
count
turned
and
to
his
right
saw
mitka
who
was
looking
at
the
count
with
popping
eyes
and
raising
his
cap
was
pointing
ahead
of
him
to
the
other
side
look
out
he
cried
in
a
voice
which
made
it
clear
that
this
word
had
been
asking
long
and
painfully
to
be
let
out
and
releasing
his
dogs
he
galloped
towards
the
count
the
count
and
semyon
leaped
out
of
the
bushes
and
to
their
left
saw
a
wolf
which
swaying
softly
was
moving
at
a
gentle
lope
to
the
left
of
them
towards
the
same
bushes
by
which
they
were
standing
the
angry
dogs
squealed
and
loosed
from
their
leashes
raced
towards
the
wolf
past
the
horses
legs
the
wolf
slowed
his
flight
turned
his
bigbrowed
head
towards
the
dogs
awkwardly
as
if
suffering
from
angina
and
swaying
just
as
softly
leaped
once
twice
and
with
a
wag
of
his
tail
disappeared
into
the
bushes
at
that
same
moment
from
the
bushes
opposite
with
a
baying
that
sounded
like
a
lament
perplexedly
leaped
one
hound
a
second
a
third
and
the
whole
pack
raced
across
the
field
to
the
same
place
where
the
wolf
had
gone
through
after
the
hounds
the
hazel
bushes
parted
and
danilos
brown
horse
appeared
dark
with
sweat
on
its
long
back
in
a

hatless
his
gray
hair
tousled
above
his
red
sweaty
face
hallooloo
halloo
he
cried
when
he
saw
the
count
his
eyes
flashed
lightning
a
he
cried
raising
his
whip
threateningly
at
the
count
you
bed
the
wolfsome
hunters
and
as
if
not
deeming
the
abashed
frightened
count
worthy
of
further
conversation
he
whipped
the
hollow
wet
flanks
of
his
brown
gelding
with
all
the
anger
he
had
prepared
for
the
count
and
raced
after
the
hounds
the
count
stood
as
if
punished
looking
around
and
trying
with
a
smile
to
evoke
some
sympathy
for
his
position
in
semyon
but
semyon
was
no
longer
there
he
was
circling
around
the
bushes
to
cut
the
wolf
off
from
the
timber
on
both
sides
the
borzoi
men
also
came
leaping
after
the
beast
but
the
wolf
got
through
the
bushes
and
not
one
hunter
intercepted
him
v
nikolai
rostov
meanwhile
stood
in
his
place
waiting
for
the
beast
from
the
way
the
chase
approached
or
withdrew
from
the
giving
tongue
of
the
dogs
he
knew
from
the
approaching
withdrawing
and
rising
voices
of
the
kennelmen
he
could
sense
what
was
happening
in
the
island
he
knew
that
there
were
growing
young
and
seasoned
old
wolves
he
knew
that
the
hounds
had
broken
up
into
two
packs
that
they
were
chasing
somewhere
and
that
something
had
gone
wrong
he
expected
the
beast
on
his
side
every
second
he
made
thousands
of
different
conjectures
about
how
and
on
which
side
the
beast
would
come
running
and
how
he
would
chase
him
down
hope
alternated
with
despair
several
times
he
addressed
god
with
a
plea
that
the
wolf
come
out
at
him
he
prayed
with
that
passionate
and
guilty
feeling
with
which
people
pray
at
moments
of
strong
agitation
arising
from
insignificant
causes
what
would
it
cost
you
he
said
to
god
do
it
for
me
i
know
you
are
great
and
its
a
sin
to
ask
it
of
you
but
for
gods
sake
make
it
so
that
the
old
wolf
comes
my
way
and
karai
before
my
uncles
eyes
gets
a
death
grip
on
his
throat
a
thousand
times
during
that
half
hour
rostov
cast
intent
strained
and
anxious
glances
around
the
edge
of
the
woods
with
two
meager
oaks
above
the
aspen
undergrowth
and
the
ravine
with
its
eroded
edge
and
his
uncles
hat
barely
showing
from
behind
a
bush
to
the
right
no
such
luck
is
not
to
be
thought
rostov
and
yet
what
would
it
cost
its
not
to
be
im
always
unlucky
in
cards
in
war
in
everything
austerlitz
and
dolokhov
vividly
but
fleetingly
flashed
in
his
imagination
if
only
once
in
my
life
i
could
chase
down
a
seasoned
wolf
id
ask
for
nothing
more
he
thought
straining
his
hearing
and
sight
looking
to
the
left
and
then
to
the
right
and
listening
to
the
smallest
nuances
in
the
sounds
of
the
chase
he
again
looked
to
the
right
and
saw
that
something
was
running
towards
him
across
the
empty
field
no
it
cant
be
thought
rostov
sighing
deeply
as
a
man
sighs
at
the
accomplishment
of
something
he
has
long
awaited
what
was
accomplished
was
his
greatest
happinessand
so
simply
without
noise
without
splendor
without
portent
rostov
could
not
believe
his
eyes
and
this
doubt
continued
for
more
than
a
second
the
wolf
ran
on
and
jumped
heavily
over
a
hole
that
lay
in
his
path
he
was
an
old
beast
with
a
gray
back
and
a
wellstuffed
reddish
belly
he
ran
unhurriedly
obviously
convinced
that
no
one
could
see
him
rostov
holding
his
breath
glanced
at
the
dogs
they
were
lying
down
or
standing
not
seeing
the
wolf
and
understanding
nothing
old
karai
turned
his
head
and
baring
his
yellow
teeth
clacked
them
along
his
haunch
angrily
searching
for
a
flea
hallooloo
rostov
said
in
a
whisper
protruding
his
lips
the
dogs
jingling
the
metal
rings
of
their
collars
jumped
up
cocking
their
ears
karai
finished
scratching
his
haunch
and
stood
up
cocking
his
ears
and
slightly
wagging
his
tail
from
which
tufts
of
fur
hung
loose
them
or
not
nikolai
was
saying
to
himself
all
the
while
the
wolf
moved
towards
him
drawing
away
from
the
woods
suddenly
the
wolfs
entire
physiognomy
changed
he
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
human
eyes
which
he
had
probably
never
seen
before
directed
at
him
and
turning
his
head
slightly
towards
the
hunter
stoppedgo
back
or
go
on
eh
it
makes
no
difference
ill
go
on
he
seemed
to
say
to
himself
and
started
forward
not
looking
around
now
at
a
soft
long
free
but
resolute
lope
halloo
nikolai
shouted
in
a
voice
not
his
own
and
of
itself
his
good
horse
raced
headlong
down
the
hill
leaping
over
gullies
to
head
off
the
wolf
and
still
more
quickly
outstripping
the
horse
raced
the
dogs
nikolai
did
not
hear
his
own
shouts
did
not
feel
that
he
was
galloping
did
not
see
the
dogs
or
the
space
over
which
he
was
galloping
he
saw
only
the
wolf
who
quickening
his
pace
loped
down
the
hollow
without
changing
direction
the
first
to
turn
up
near
the
beast
was
the
blackspotted
broadhaunched
milka
who
began
to
close
in
on
him
closer
closerthere
she
was
right
next
to
him
but
the
wolf
barely
gave
her
a
sidelong
glance
and
instead
of
pushing
on
as
she
always
did
milka
raising
her
tail
suddenly
began
braking
with
her
forelegs
halloolooloo
shouted
nikolai
the
red
lyubim
overtook
milka
precipitously
threw
himself
at
the
wolf
and
seized
him
by
the
hindquarters
but
in
the
same
second
became
frightened
and
jumped
over
to
the
other
side
the
wolf
crouched
clacked
his
teeth
got
up
again
and
loped
on
accompanied
at
two
yards
distance
by
all
the
dogs
who
would
not
go
nearer
to
him
hell
get
away
no
its
impossible
thought
nikolai
continuing
to
shout
in
a
hoarse
voice
karai
halloo
he
shouted
his
eyes
seeking
the
old
dog
his
only
hope
karai
with
all
his
aged
strength
stretching
out
as
much
as
he
could
looking
at
the
wolf
galloped
heavily
alongside
the
beast
trying
to
head
him
off
but
it
was
clear
from
the
speed
of
the
wolf
and
the
slowness
of
the
dog
that
karais
calculation
was
wrong
not
far
ahead
of
him
now
nikolai
saw
the
woods
on
reaching
which
the
wolf
would
certainly
get
away
ahead
of
them
dogs
appeared
and
a
hunter
galloping
almost
straight
towards
them
there
was
still
hope
a
young
lanky
brindled
dog
unknown
to
nikolai
from
another
pack
flew
swiftly
at
the
wolf
from
the
front
and
nearly
bowled
him
over
the
wolf
got
up
more
quickly
than
might
have
been
expected
of
him
rushed
at
the
brindled
dog
snapped
his
teethand
the
bloodied
dog
its
side
ripped
open
let
out
a
piercing
squeal
burying
its
head
in
the
ground
karayushka
old
boy
wept
nikolai
thanks
to
the
delay
the
old
dog
his
matted
fur
hanging
from
his
haunches
headed
off
the
wolf
and
was
now
within
five
paces
of
him
the
wolf
as
if
sensing
the
danger
gave
karai
a
sidelong
glance
tucked
his
tail
still
further
between
his
legs
and
increased
his
pace
but
herenikolai
only
saw
that
something
happened
with
karaihe
was
instantly
on
top
of
the
wolf
and
rolled
head
over
heels
with
him
into
a
ditch
in
front
of
them
that
moment
when
nikolai
saw
the
dogs
swarming
over
the
wolf
in
the
ditch
saw
under
them
the
wolfs
gray
fur
his
outstretched
hind
leg
and
his
frightened
and
gasping
head
with
its
ears
laid
back
karai
had
him
by
the
throatthe
moment
when
nikolai
saw
that
was
the
happiest
moment
of
his
life
he
had
already
taken
hold
of
the
pommel
so
as
to
dismount
and
stab
the
wolf
when
the
beasts
head
suddenly
thrust
itself
out
from
the
mass
of
dogs
then
his
front
legs
stood
up
on
the
edge
of
the
ditch
the
wolf
clacked
his
teeth
karai
no
longer
had
him
by
the
throat
leaped
out
of
the
ditch
with
his
hind
legs
and
tucking
in
his
tail
moved
off
drawing
away
from
the
dogs
again
karai
his
fur
bristling
probably
bruised
or
wounded
had
difficulty
climbing
out
of
the
ditch
my
god
why
nikolai
cried
in
despair
the
uncles
hunter
rode
across
the
wolfs
path
from
the
other
side
and
his
dogs
again
stopped
the
beast
he
was
again
surrounded
nikolai
his
groom
the
uncle
and
his
hunter
all
rode
round
and
round
the
beast
hallooing
shouting
preparing
to
dismount
at
any
moment
when
the
wolf
sat
on
his
haunches
and
leaping
forward
each
time
the
wolf
shook
himself
and
made
a
move
towards
the
timber
which
would
save
him
from
the
beginning
of
this
chase
danilo
hearing
the
hallooing
had
ridden
out
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
he
saw
karai
take
the
wolf
and
stopped
his
horse
supposing
the
business
was
over
but
when
the
hunters
did
not
dismount
when
the
wolf
shook
himself
and
again
began
to
make
off
danilo
sent
his
brown
horse
not
towards
the
wolf
but
in
a
straight
line
towards
the
timber
just
as
karai
had
done
to
head
off
the
wolf
thanks
to
this
direction
he
rode
up
to
the
wolf
just
as
the
uncles
dogs
stopped
him
a
second
time
danilo
rode
silently
holding
an
unsheathed
dagger
in
his
left
hand
and
threshing
the
taut
flanks
of
his
brown
horse
with
his
whip
as
if
it
was
a
flail
nikolai
did
not
see
or
hear
danilo
until
the
brown
horse
breathing
heavily
snorted
past
him
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
body
falling
and
saw
that
danilo
was
already
lying
on
the
wolfs
rump
in
the
midst
of
the
dogs
trying
to
catch
him
by
the
ears
it
was
obvious
to
the
hunters
and
to
the
dogs
and
to
the
wolf
himself
that
it
was
all
over
now
the
beast
his
ears
laid
back
fearfully
tried
to
get
up
but
the
dogs
clung
to
him
danilo
standing
up
made
a
falling
step
and
with
his
whole
weight
as
if
lying
down
to
rest
collapsed
on
the
wolf
seizing
him
by
the
ears
nikolai
wanted
to
stab
him
but
danilo
whispered
dont
well
truss
him
up
and
changing
position
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
wolfs
neck
they
put
a
stick
in
the
wolfs
mouth
tied
it
with
a
leash
like
a
bridle
bound
his
legs
and
danilo
rolled
the
wolf
from
side
to
side
a
couple
of
times
with
happy
exhausted
faces
they
hoisted
the
live
seasoned
old
wolf
onto
a
shying
snorting
horse
and
accompanied
by
the
squealing
dogs
took
him
to
the
place
where
they
were
all
supposed
to
assemble
the
hounds
had
taken
two
young
wolves
and
the
borzois
three
the
hunters
came
together
with
their
quarry
and
their
stories
and
everybody
went
to
look
at
the
seasoned
old
wolf
who
lolling
his
bigbrowed
head
with
the
stick
gripped
in
his
mouth
looked
with
wide
glassy
eyes
at
this
whole
crowd
of
dogs
and
people
surrounding
him
when
touched
he
jerked
his
bound
legs
and
looked
at
them
all
wildly
and
at
the
same
time
simply
count
ilya
andreich
also
rode
up
and
touched
the
wolf
oh
what
a
big
old
seasoned
one
he
said
a
seasoned
one
eh
he
asked
danilo
who
was
standing
next
to
him
yes
a
seasoned
one
your
excellency
replied
danilo
hastily
doffing
his
hat
the
count
remembered
how
he
had
let
the
wolf
slip
and
his
confrontation
with
danilo
you
do
get
angry
though
brother
said
the
count
danilo
said
nothing
and
just
shyly
smiled
his
childishly
meek
and
pleasant
smile
vi
the
old
count
rode
home
natasha
and
petya
stayed
with
the
hunt
promising
to
come
at
once
the
hunt
went
further
on
because
it
was
still
early
at
midday
the
hounds
were
loosed
into
a
ravine
overgrown
with
dense
young
forest
nikolai
standing
in
the
stubble
could
see
all
his
hunters
across
from
nikolai
was
a
field
of
winter
wheat
and
there
stood
one
of
his
hunters
alone
in
a
hollow
behind
an
upthrust
hazel
bush
as
soon
as
the
hounds
were
loosed
into
the
ravine
nikolai
heard
the
intermittent
baying
of
a
dog
he
knewvoltorn
other
dogs
joined
him
now
falling
silent
now
giving
tongue
again
a
moment
later
from
the
woods
came
a
foxhunting
cry
and
the
whole
pack
joining
together
went
racing
along
the
edge
of
the
ravine
in
the
direction
of
the
field
away
from
nikolai
he
saw
the
whippersin
in
their
red
hats
riding
along
the
edge
of
the
overgrown
ravine
he
even
saw
the
dogs
and
expected
every
second
that
a
fox
would
appear
on
the
other
side
on
the
green
field
the
hunter
who
was
standing
in
the
hollow
stirred
and
loosed
his
dogs
and
nikolai
saw
a
strange
lowslung
red
fox
which
puffing
up
its
tail
raced
swiftly
across
the
field
the
dogs
bore
down
on
it
now
they
drew
close
now
it
started
dodging
among
them
circling
more
and
more
quickly
and
twining
its
puffedup
brush
tail
around
itself
and
now
someones
white
dog
flew
at
it
and
after
it
a
black
one
and
everything
became
confused
and
then
the
dogs
stood
forming
a
star
their
rumps
pointing
outwards
swaying
slightly
two
hunters
rode
up
to
the
dogs
one
in
a
red
hat
the
other
a
stranger
in
a
green
kaftan
whats
this
thought
nikolai
where
did
that
hunter
appear
from
hes
not
uncles
the
hunters
took
the
fox
from
the
dogs
and
stood
dismounted
for
a
long
time
without
strapping
it
on
the
horses
their
bridles
free
and
their
saddles
jutting
up
stood
nearby
and
the
dogs
lay
down
the
hunters
waved
their
arms
and
did
something
with
the
fox
the
sound
of
a
horn
rang
out
from
therethe
conventional
signal
of
a
fight
its
ilagins
hunter
and
our
ivan
acting
up
over
something
said
nikolais
groom
nikolai
sent
his
groom
to
call
his
sister
and
petya
to
him
and
rode
at
a
walk
to
the
place
where
the
kennelmen
were
gathering
the
hounds
several
hunters
galloped
to
the
scene
of
the
fight
nikolai
dismounted
and
stood
by
the
hounds
with
natasha
and
petya
who
joined
him
waiting
for
news
of
how
the
matter
would
end
the
hunter
who
had
been
fighting
left
the
edge
of
the
woods
with
the
fox
strapped
to
his
saddle
and
rode
over
to
his
young
master
he
took
off
his
hat
while
still
some
distance
away
and
tried
to
speak
respectfully
but
he
was
pale
breathless
and
his
face
was
angry
he
had
a
black
eye
but
he
probably
did
not
know
it
what
was
that
about
asked
nikolai
why
as
if
hes
going
to
hunt
out
from
under
our
hounds
it
was
my
mousegray
bitch
that
caught
it
go
on
take
it
to
court
he
grabs
hold
of
the
fox
i
whacked
him
with
it
you
want
it
its
strapped
on
here
and
how
would
you
like
a
bit
of
this
said
the
hunter
pointing
to
his
dagger
and
probably
imagining
that
he
was
still
talking
to
his
enemy
nikolai
not
responding
to
the
hunter
asked
his
sister
and
petya
to
wait
for
him
and
rode
to
the
place
where
ilagins
hostile
hunt
stood
the
victorious
hunter
rode
into
the
crowd
of
hunters
and
there
surrounded
by
curious
sympathizers
told
of
his
exploit
the
thing
was
that
ilagin
with
whom
the
rostovs
had
had
a
quarrel
and
a
lawsuit
used
to
hunt
in
places
that
customarily
belonged
to
the
rostovs
and
now
as
if
on
purpose
had
sent
his
men
to
the
reserve
where
the
rostovs
were
hunting
and
had
allowed
his
hunter
to
take
the
quarry
hunted
down
by
the
rostovs
hounds
nikolai
had
never
seen
ilagin
but
as
usual
knowing
no
middle
way
in
his
opinions
and
feelings
judging
by
the
rumors
of
this
landowners
violence
and
willfulness
hated
him
with
all
his
heart
and
considered
him
his
bitterest
enemy
he
was
now
riding
to
him
in
angry
agitation
firmly
gripping
his
whip
and
fully
prepared
for
the
most
resolute
and
dangerous
actions
against
his
enemy
he
had
barely
ridden
out
beyond
the
projecting
arm
of
the
forest
when
he
saw
a
fat
gentleman
in
a
visored
beaver
cap
coming
towards
him
on
a
beautiful
black
horse
accompanied
by
two
grooms
instead
of
an
enemy
nikolai
found
in
ilagin
a
respectable
courteous
gentleman
especially
desirous
of
making
the
young
counts
acquaintance
riding
up
to
rostov
ilagin
raised
his
beaver
cap
and
said
that
he
very
much
regretted
what
had
happened
said
that
he
would
order
the
hunter
punished
for
allowing
himself
to
hunt
from
under
another
mans
dogs
asked
to
make
the
counts
acquaintance
and
offered
him
his
own
hunting
spots
natasha
fearing
that
her
brother
would
do
something
terrible
in
his
agitation
followed
not
far
behind
him
seeing
the
enemies
greet
each
other
amicably
she
rode
up
to
them
ilagin
raised
his
beaver
cap
still
higher
before
natasha
and
smiling
pleasantly
said
that
the
countess
represented
diana
both
in
her
passion
for
hunting
and
in
her
beauty
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
to
smooth
over
his
hunters
offense
ilagin
insistently
invited
rostov
to
come
to
his
upland
which
was
less
than
a
mile
away
which
he
kept
for
himself
and
which
according
to
him
was
all
strewn
with
hares
nikolai
accepted
and
the
hunt
having
doubled
in
size
moved
on
to
reach
ilagins
upland
they
had
to
go
across
the
fields
the
hunters
spread
out
the
gentry
rode
together
the
uncle
rostov
and
ilagin
kept
glancing
at
each
others
dogs
on
the
sly
trying
to
keep
the
others
from
noticing
and
sought
worriedly
among
those
dogs
for
rivals
to
their
own
rostov
was
especially
struck
by
the
beauty
of
a
small
purebred
redspotted
bitch
in
ilagins
pack
slender
but
with
muscles
of
steel
narrow
pincers
muzzle
and
prominent
black
eyes
he
had
heard
about
the
swiftness
of
ilagins
dogs
and
in
this
beautiful
bitch
saw
a
rival
to
his
milka
in
the
middle
of
a
sedate
conversation
about
that
years
harvest
begun
by
ilagin
nikolai
pointed
to
his
redspotted
bitch
thats
a
good
bitch
youve
got
he
said
in
a
casual
tone
swiftfooted
this
one
yes
shes
a
good
dog
a
catcher
ilagin
said
in
an
indifferent
voice
of
his
redspotted
yerza
for
whom
he
had
given
his
neighbor
three
families
of
house
serfs
a
year
before
so
with
you
too
count
theres
no
boasting
about
flour
production
this
year
he
continued
the
conversation
and
considering
it
polite
to
pay
the
young
count
back
in
kind
ilagin
looked
over
his
dogs
and
picked
out
milka
whose
broadness
struck
his
eye
shes
a
good
one
that
blackspotted
one
of
yourswellbuilt
he
said
yes
shes
all
right
good
speed
nikolai
replied
if
only
there
was
a
seasoned
hare
running
through
the
field
id
show
you
what
kind
of
dog
she
is
he
thought
and
turning
to
his
groom
he
said
he
would
give
a
rouble
to
the
hunter
who
could
spot
a
hare
in
its
form
i
dont
understand
ilagin
went
on
how
it
is
that
other
hunters
can
be
jealous
over
game
and
dogs
ill
tell
you
about
myself
count
i
enjoy
having
a
ride
you
know
you
get
together
with
company
like
thiswhat
could
be
better
he
again
took
his
beaver
cap
off
to
natasha
but
this
counting
skins
who
brought
in
how
manyits
all
the
same
to
me
well
yes
or
that
i
should
get
upset
that
another
mans
dog
catches
it
and
not
mineall
i
want
is
to
admire
the
chase
isnt
that
so
count
then
in
my
opinion
halloo
came
the
longdrawn
cry
of
one
of
the
borzoi
men
who
had
stopped
he
was
standing
on
a
low
knoll
amidst
the
stubble
with
his
whip
raised
and
once
more
called
out
hallooo
this
sound
and
the
raised
whip
signified
that
he
had
spotted
a
hare
in
its
form
in
front
of
him
ah
seems
hes
spotted
one
ilagin
said
casually
well
lets
course
it
count
yes
we
should
ride
overtogether
shall
we
nikolai
replied
looking
at
yerza
and
at
his
uncles
red
rugai
two
rivals
with
whom
he
had
never
yet
had
his
dogs
compete
and
what
if
they
pull
my
milka
off
its
ears
he
thought
heading
for
the
hare
alongside
his
uncle
and
ilagin
a
seasoned
one
asked
ilagin
approaching
the
hunter
who
had
spotted
the
hare
and
turning
not
without
excitement
to
whistle
up
yerza
and
you
mikhail
nikanorych
he
turned
to
the
uncle
the
uncle
rode
along
scowling
why
should
i
get
into
it
your
dogsright
you
areyou
paid
a
village
for
each
of
them
they
cost
thousands
you
match
yours
and
ill
watch
rugai
here
here
he
cried
rugayushka
he
added
involuntarily
expressing
by
this
diminutive
his
tenderness
and
the
hope
he
placed
in
this
red
dog
natasha
saw
and
felt
the
hidden
excitement
of
these
two
old
men
and
her
brother
and
was
excited
herself
the
hunter
on
the
knoll
stood
with
his
whip
raised
the
gentlemen
rode
up
to
him
at
a
walk
the
hounds
running
just
on
the
horizon
were
turning
away
from
the
hare
the
rest
of
the
hunters
were
also
riding
away
everything
moved
slowly
and
sedately
wheres
his
head
pointing
asked
nikolai
riding
up
within
a
hundred
paces
of
the
hunter
who
had
spotted
the
hare
but
before
the
hunter
had
time
to
reply
the
hare
sensing
which
way
the
wind
was
turning
leaped
up
from
his
form
the
pack
of
hounds
linked
in
pairs
raced
baying
down
the
hill
after
the
hare
from
all
sides
the
borzois
which
were
not
on
leashes
rushed
after
the
hounds
and
the
hare
all
those
slowly
moving
hunters
and
whippersin
crying
hold
upthrowing
off
their
dogsand
the
borzoi
men
crying
sic
him
and
driving
their
dogs
ongalloped
across
the
field
the
calm
ilagin
nikolai
natasha
and
the
uncle
flew
along
not
knowing
how
or
where
seeing
only
the
dogs
and
the
hare
and
only
fearing
to
lose
sight
even
for
a
moment
of
the
course
of
the
chase
the
hare
happened
to
be
seasoned
and
swiftfooted
jumping
up
he
did
not
run
at
once
but
moved
his
ears
listening
to
the
shouting
and
stamping
that
suddenly
arose
on
all
sides
he
made
some
ten
leaps
not
quickly
letting
the
dogs
get
closer
to
him
and
finally
choosing
his
direction
and
realizing
the
danger
laid
his
ears
back
and
dashed
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
he
had
been
lying
in
the
stubble
but
ahead
of
him
were
the
green
fields
where
the
ground
was
soggy
the
two
dogs
of
the
hunter
who
had
spotted
the
hare
being
closest
to
him
were
the
first
to
view
and
start
after
the
hare
but
they
were
still
far
from
him
when
ilagins
redspotted
yerza
flew
up
from
behind
got
within
a
dogs
length
of
him
raced
on
at
a
terrible
speed
aiming
at
the
hares
tail
and
thinking
she
had
seized
him
went
rolling
head
over
heels
the
hare
arched
his
back
and
raced
on
still
more
swiftly
yerza
was
overtaken
from
behind
by
the
broadhaunched
blackspotted
milka
who
sped
quickly
towards
the
hare
good
girl
milushka
nikolai
cried
triumphantly
it
seemed
that
milka
was
about
to
hit
the
hare
and
snatch
him
up
but
she
drew
level
and
missed
him
the
hare
leaped
aside
again
the
beautiful
yerza
was
on
the
hare
and
hovering
right
over
his
tail
as
if
measuring
so
as
not
to
miss
this
time
and
take
him
by
the
haunch
yerzinka
dearie
wailed
ilagin
in
a
voice
not
his
own
yerza
did
not
heed
his
prayer
at
the
very
moment
she
was
expected
to
seize
the
hare
he
swerved
and
flew
out
to
the
boundary
between
the
green
fields
and
the
stubble
again
yerza
and
milka
like
a
team
of
horses
straightened
up
and
sped
after
the
hare
it
was
easier
for
him
to
run
along
the
boundary
and
dogs
could
not
close
in
on
him
so
quickly
rugai
rugayushka
right
you
are
a
new
voice
cried
just
then
and
rugai
the
uncles
red
hunchbacked
dog
stretching
out
then
arching
his
back
caught
up
with
the
first
pair
of
dogs
went
ahead
of
them
raced
with
a
terrible
selflessness
right
onto
the
hare
knocked
him
from
the
boundary
into
the
green
field
raced
on
still
more
fiercely
over
the
muddy
green
growth
sinking
up
to
his
knees
and
one
could
only
see
him
go
rolling
head
over
heels
dirtying
his
back
in
the
mud
together
with
the
hare
the
dogs
surrounded
him
in
a
star
a
moment
later
everyone
was
standing
by
the
crowding
dogs
the
happy
uncle
dismounted
alone
and
cut
off
the
hares
foot
shaking
the
hare
to
make
the
blood
run
down
he
looked
around
uneasily
his
eyes
darting
not
knowing
where
to
put
his
arms
and
legs
and
spoke
himself
not
knowing
what
or
to
whom
theres
a
right
good
piece
of
worktheres
a
dogoutran
them
all
a
thousand
roubles
or
oneright
you
are
he
said
gasping
and
looking
around
angrily
as
if
scolding
someone
as
if
they
were
all
his
enemies
as
if
they
had
all
offended
him
and
he
had
only
now
finally
managed
to
vindicate
himself
theres
your
thousandruble
dogs
for
youright
you
are
catch
rugai
he
said
tossing
him
the
cutoff
paw
with
dirt
stuck
to
it
you
earned
itright
you
are
shes
worn
out
she
ran
him
down
three
times
by
herself
nikolai
said
also
not
listening
to
anyone
and
not
caring
whether
anyone
was
listening
to
him
he
cut
in
ilagins
groom
was
saying
she
almost
had
him
and
after
that
any
mongrel
could
have
caught
him
ilagin
was
saying
at
the
same
time
redfaced
trying
to
catch
his
breath
after
the
galloping
and
excitement
at
the
same
time
natasha
without
pausing
for
breath
let
out
a
joyful
and
rapturous
shriek
so
shrill
that
it
made
their
ears
ring
with
this
shriek
she
expressed
everything
the
other
hunters
had
expressed
with
their
simultaneous
talk
and
this
shriek
was
so
odd
that
she
herself
would
have
been
embarrassed
at
such
wild
shrieking
and
they
all
would
have
been
surprised
at
it
if
it
had
happened
at
any
other
time
the
uncle
strapped
up
the
hare
flipped
it
nimbly
and
deftly
across
his
horses
croup
as
if
reproaching
them
all
by
this
flipping
and
mounting
his
chestnut
with
such
a
look
as
though
he
did
not
even
want
to
speak
with
anyone
rode
off
everyone
else
but
he
sad
and
offended
rode
along
and
only
after
a
long
time
could
they
recover
their
former
sham
indifference
for
a
long
time
they
kept
glancing
at
the
red
rugai
who
his
hunched
back
dirty
with
mud
jingling
his
collar
trotted
behind
the
uncles
horses
legs
with
the
calm
look
of
a
conqueror
so
im
just
like
all
the
rest
when
its
not
a
matter
of
the
chase
well
but
when
it
is
watch
out
was
as
it
seemed
to
nikolai
what
the
dogs
look
said
when
a
long
time
later
the
uncle
rode
up
to
nikolai
and
began
speaking
to
him
nikolai
felt
flattered
that
after
all
that
had
happened
his
uncle
still
condescended
to
speak
to
him
vii
when
ilagin
took
leave
of
nikolai
in
the
evening
nikolai
was
so
far
from
home
that
he
accepted
his
uncles
offer
to
quit
the
hunt
and
spend
the
night
with
him
the
uncle
in
his
village
of
mikhailovka
and
if
you
come
to
my
placeright
you
arethat
will
be
even
better
said
the
uncle
you
see
its
wet
weather
the
uncle
said
youd
get
some
rest
the
little
countess
would
be
taken
in
the
droshky
the
uncles
offer
was
accepted
a
hunter
was
sent
to
otradnoe
for
the
droshky
and
nikolai
went
to
the
uncles
with
natasha
and
petya
some
five
men
servants
big
and
small
ran
out
to
the
front
porch
to
meet
the
master
dozens
of
women
old
big
and
little
stuck
themselves
out
from
the
back
porch
to
look
at
the
arriving
hunters
the
presence
of
natasha
a
woman
a
lady
on
horseback
raised
the
curiosity
of
the
uncles
people
to
such
a
degree
of
astonishment
that
many
unabashed
by
her
presence
went
up
to
her
looked
into
her
eyes
and
made
remarks
about
her
as
about
some
wonder
on
display
which
was
not
a
human
being
and
could
not
hear
or
understand
that
they
were
talking
about
her
arinka
look
she
sits
sideways
she
sits
and
her
skirt
hangs
downsee
theres
a
little
horn
saints
alive
a
little
knife
see
like
a
tartar
woman
how
is
it
you
dont
go
head
over
heels
the
boldest
of
them
said
addressing
natasha
directly
the
uncle
dismounted
by
the
porch
of
his
small
wooden
house
sunk
in
a
garden
and
looking
over
his
domestics
shouted
peremptorily
that
the
superfluous
people
should
take
themselves
off
and
everything
necessary
should
be
done
to
receive
the
guests
and
the
hunt
they
all
dispersed
the
uncle
helped
natasha
down
from
the
horse
and
led
her
by
the
arm
up
the
shaky
plank
steps
of
the
porch
the
house
unplastered
with
timber
walls
was
not
very
clean
insideone
could
see
that
the
aim
of
those
living
in
it
did
not
consist
in
keeping
it
spotlessbut
there
were
also
no
signs
of
neglect
the
entryway
smelled
of
fresh
apples
and
was
hung
with
wolf
and
fox
pelts
the
uncle
led
his
guests
through
the
front
hall
into
a
small
reception
room
with
a
folding
table
and
red
chairs
then
to
a
drawing
room
with
a
round
birch
table
and
a
sofa
then
to
the
study
with
a
torn
sofa
a
worn
rug
and
portraits
of
suvorov
the
hosts
father
and
mother
and
himself
in
military
uniform
the
study
smelled
strongly
of
tobacco
and
dogs
in
the
study
the
uncle
asked
his
guests
to
sit
down
and
make
themselves
at
home
and
he
himself
left
rugai
with
his
still
dirty
back
came
into
the
study
and
lay
on
the
sofa
cleaning
himself
with
his
tongue
and
teeth
from
the
study
led
a
corridor
in
which
one
could
see
screens
with
torn
curtains
from
behind
the
screens
came
womens
laughter
and
whispering
natasha
nikolai
and
petya
took
their
coats
off
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
petya
leaned
on
his
arm
and
immediately
fell
asleep
natasha
and
nikolai
sat
silently
their
faces
were
burning
they
were
very
hungry
and
very
merry
they
looked
at
each
other
after
the
hunt
inside
the
house
nikolai
no
longer
considered
it
necessary
to
display
his
male
superiority
before
his
sister
natasha
winked
at
her
brother
the
two
restrained
themselves
for
a
time
then
burst
into
ringing
laughter
before
they
managed
to
think
up
a
pretext
for
their
laughter
a
little
later
the
uncle
came
in
wearing
a
jerkin
dark
blue
trousers
and
low
boots
and
natasha
felt
that
this
same
costume
in
which
she
had
looked
upon
her
uncle
with
astonishment
and
mockery
at
otradnoe
was
a
genuine
costume
in
no
way
worse
than
frock
coats
and
tailcoats
the
uncle
was
also
merry
not
only
was
he
not
offended
by
the
laughter
of
the
brother
and
sister
it
would
not
have
entered
his
head
that
they
might
laugh
at
his
way
of
life
but
he
joined
in
their
causeless
laughter
himself
thats
the
young
countessright
you
areive
never
seen
another
like
her
he
said
handing
a
pipe
with
a
long
chibouk
to
rostov
and
with
a
habitual
gesture
tucking
another
its
chibouk
cut
short
between
three
fingers
shes
ridden
all
day
enough
for
a
man
and
it
seems
like
nothing
to
her
soon
after
the
uncle
the
door
was
opened
by
a
girlevidently
barefoot
by
the
sound
of
her
feetand
through
it
came
a
fat
redcheeked
beautiful
woman
of
about
forty
with
a
double
chin
and
full
red
lips
carrying
a
big
heavily
laden
tray
she
looked
around
at
the
guests
with
hospitable
dignity
and
affability
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
every
movement
and
with
an
amiable
smile
bowed
respectfully
to
them
despite
her
more
than
usual
stoutness
which
made
her
thrust
her
chest
and
stomach
forward
and
hold
her
head
back
this
woman
the
uncles
housekeeper
had
an
extremely
light
step
she
went
to
the
table
set
down
the
tray
and
with
her
plump
white
hands
deftly
took
the
bottles
snacks
and
treats
and
arranged
them
on
the
table
having
finished
that
she
stepped
away
and
with
a
smile
on
her
face
stood
by
the
door
here
i
am
now
do
you
understand
your
uncle
her
appearance
said
to
rostov
how
could
he
not
understand
not
only
rostov
but
natasha
as
well
understood
the
uncle
and
the
meaning
of
the
frowning
brows
and
happy
selfcontented
smile
that
puckered
his
lips
slightly
the
moment
anisya
fyodorovna
came
in
on
the
tray
were
an
herb
cordial
liqueurs
mushrooms
flat
cakes
made
from
dark
flour
and
buttermilk
honey
in
the
comb
still
and
foaming
mead
apples
fresh
and
roasted
nuts
and
nuts
in
honey
then
anisya
fyodorovna
brought
preserves
made
with
honey
and
with
sugar
and
a
ham
and
a
justroasted
chicken
all
this
was
tended
gathered
and
cooked
by
anisya
fyodorovna
all
this
smelled
and
spoke
and
had
the
taste
of
anisya
fyodorovna
it
all
spoke
of
juiciness
cleanness
whiteness
and
a
pleasant
smile
have
some
little
miss
countess
she
repeated
serving
natasha
one
thing
then
another
natasha
ate
everything
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
seen
or
tasted
anywhere
such
buttermilk
flat
cakes
preserves
so
fragrant
such
nuts
in
honey
or
such
a
chicken
anisya
fyodorovna
left
rostov
and
the
uncle
washing
their
dinner
down
with
cherry
liqueur
spoke
of
past
and
future
hunts
of
rugai
and
of
ilagins
dogs
natasha
her
eyes
shining
sat
straightbacked
on
the
sofa
listening
to
them
she
tried
several
times
to
wake
up
petya
and
give
him
something
to
eat
but
he
mumbled
incomprehensibly
evidently
without
waking
up
natasha
was
in
such
merry
spirits
she
felt
so
good
in
these
new
surroundings
that
she
only
feared
the
droshky
would
come
for
her
too
soon
after
a
chance
moment
of
silence
as
almost
always
happens
with
people
who
receive
acquaintances
in
their
house
for
the
first
time
the
uncle
said
answering
a
thought
that
was
in
his
guests
minds
so
this
is
how
ill
live
out
my
lifeill
dieright
you
aretherell
be
nothing
left
no
use
sinning
the
uncles
face
was
very
significant
and
even
handsome
as
he
said
it
rostov
involuntarily
remembered
all
the
good
things
he
had
heard
from
his
father
and
the
neighbors
about
his
uncle
in
this
whole
the
province
his
uncle
had
the
reputation
of
a
most
noble
and
disinterested
eccentric
he
was
called
in
to
judge
family
matters
he
was
asked
to
be
an
executor
secrets
were
entrusted
to
him
he
was
elected
to
a
judgeship
and
to
other
posts
but
he
always
stubbornly
refused
social
service
spending
the
fall
and
spring
in
the
fields
riding
his
chestnut
gelding
sitting
at
home
in
the
winter
and
lying
in
his
overgrown
garden
in
the
summer
how
is
it
you
dont
serve
uncle
i
did
but
i
quit
unfit
for
itright
you
arei
dont
understand
a
thing
its
your
sort
of
business
i
dont
have
brains
enough
as
for
hunting
thats
another
matterits
right
you
are
open
the
door
there
he
shouted
why
did
you
close
it
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
which
the
uncle
called
a
collidor
led
to
the
bachelor
hunters
room
as
the
hunters
common
room
was
known
bare
feet
quickly
pattered
off
and
an
invisible
hand
opened
the
door
to
the
hunters
room
from
the
corridor
the
sounds
of
a
balalaika
became
clearly
audible
played
by
someone
who
was
obviously
a
master
at
it
natasha
had
long
been
listening
to
those
sounds
and
now
went
to
the
corridor
to
hear
them
better
thats
my
mitka
the
coachmani
bought
him
a
good
balalaika
i
like
it
said
the
uncle
it
was
the
uncles
custom
that
when
he
came
back
from
the
hunt
mitka
would
play
the
balalaika
in
the
bachelor
hunters
room
the
uncle
liked
listening
to
this
music
how
good
excellent
really
said
nikolai
with
a
sort
of
involuntary
disdain
as
if
he
was
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
found
the
sounds
very
pleasing
what
do
you
mean
excellent
natasha
said
with
reproach
feeling
the
tone
with
which
her
brother
had
said
it
its
not
excellent
its
simply
lovely
just
as
the
uncles
mushrooms
honey
and
liqueurs
seemed
the
best
in
the
world
to
her
so
this
song
too
seemed
to
her
at
that
moment
the
height
of
musical
loveliness
more
please
more
natasha
said
through
the
door
as
soon
as
the
balalaika
fell
silent
mitka
tuned
up
and
again
began
picking
out
barinya
with
runs
and
leaps
the
uncle
sat
and
listened
his
head
inclined
to
one
side
with
a
barely
perceptible
smile
the
melody
of
barinya
was
repeated
some
hundred
times
the
balalaika
was
tuned
several
times
and
again
the
same
sounds
rippled
out
and
the
listeners
were
not
bored
but
only
wanted
to
hear
this
playing
again
and
again
anisya
fyodorovna
came
in
and
leaned
her
corpulent
body
against
the
doorpost
listen
if
you
please
little
countess
she
said
to
natasha
with
a
smile
very
much
like
the
uncles
smile
he
plays
nicely
she
said
this
he
doesnt
do
right
the
uncle
said
suddenly
with
an
energetic
gesture
he
should
pour
it
onright
you
arepour
it
on
and
can
you
do
it
natasha
asked
the
uncle
smiled
without
answering
go
anisyushka
see
whether
my
guitar
has
all
its
strings
or
not
havent
set
hand
to
it
for
a
long
time
right
you
are
gave
it
up
anisya
fyodorovna
went
eagerly
with
her
light
step
to
fulfill
her
masters
request
and
fetched
the
guitar
the
uncle
not
looking
at
anyone
blew
the
dust
off
rapped
on
the
face
of
the
guitar
with
his
bony
fingers
tuned
it
up
and
settled
comfortably
in
his
armchair
he
took
hold
of
the
guitar
with
a
slightly
theatrical
gesture
cocking
his
left
elbow
a
little
higher
on
the
neck
and
with
a
wink
to
anisya
fyodorovna
did
not
begin
barinya
but
struck
one
sonorous
pure
chord
and
measuredly
calmly
but
firmly
began
at
a
very
slow
tempo
to
pick
out
the
wellknown
song
down
the
roooadway
at
once
in
time
with
that
sober
merriment
the
same
that
was
breathed
out
by
anisya
fyodorovnas
whole
being
the
tune
of
the
song
began
to
sing
in
the
souls
of
nikolai
and
natasha
anisya
fyodorovna
blushed
and
covering
her
face
with
her
kerchief
left
the
room
laughing
the
uncle
continued
to
pick
out
the
song
clearly
assiduously
and
with
energetic
firmness
gazing
with
an
altered
inspired
gaze
at
the
place
anisya
fyodorovna
had
left
something
laughed
slightly
in
his
face
on
one
side
under
his
gray
mustache
and
it
laughed
especially
when
as
the
song
got
going
the
tempo
quickened
and
in
running
passages
there
would
be
a
sudden
break
lovely
lovely
uncle
more
more
cried
natasha
as
soon
as
he
finished
she
jumped
up
from
her
place
embraced
her
uncle
and
kissed
him
nikolenka
nikolenka
she
said
glancing
at
her
brother
as
if
asking
him
what
on
earth
is
it
nikolai
also
liked
the
uncles
playing
very
much
the
uncle
played
the
song
a
second
time
anisya
fyodorovnas
smiling
face
again
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
behind
her
some
other
faces
fetching
water
clear
and
cold
he
cries
out
oh
maiden
hold
the
uncle
played
again
made
a
skillful
run
broke
off
and
twitched
his
shoulders
come
come
dearest
uncle
natasha
moaned
in
such
an
imploring
voice
as
though
her
life
depended
on
it
the
uncle
got
up
and
it
was
as
if
there
were
two
men
in
himone
smiled
gravely
at
the
jolly
fellow
while
the
jolly
fellow
performed
a
na239ve
and
precise
little
caper
before
dancing
come
niece
cried
the
uncle
waving
to
natasha
with
the
hand
that
had
broken
off
the
chord
natasha
threw
off
the
kerchief
she
had
wrapped
around
her
ran
and
placed
herself
in
front
of
her
uncle
and
arms
akimbo
made
a
movement
with
her
shoulders
and
stopped
where
how
and
when
had
this
little
countess
brought
up
by
an
233migr233
frenchwoman
sucked
this
spirit
in
from
the
russian
air
she
breathed
where
had
she
gotten
these
ways
which
should
have
been
long
supplanted
by
the
pas
de
ch226le
yet
that
spirit
and
these
ways
were
those
very
inimitable
unstudied
russian
ones
which
the
uncle
expected
of
her
as
soon
as
she
stood
there
smiling
triumphantly
proudly
and
with
sly
merriment
the
fear
which
had
first
seized
nikolai
and
all
those
presentthat
she
would
not
do
it
rightwent
away
and
they
began
to
admire
her
she
did
it
exactly
right
and
so
precisely
so
perfectly
precisely
that
anisya
fyodorovna
who
at
once
handed
natasha
the
kerchief
she
needed
for
it
wept
through
her
laughter
looking
at
this
slender
graceful
countess
brought
up
in
silk
and
velvet
so
foreign
to
her
who
was
able
to
understand
everything
that
was
in
anisya
and
in
anisyas
father
and
in
her
aunt
and
in
her
mother
and
in
every
russian
well
little
countess
right
you
are
the
uncle
said
laughing
joyfully
finishing
the
dance
what
a
niece
now
all
we
need
is
to
choose
you
a
fine
young
fellow
for
a
husband
right
you
are
hes
already
been
chosen
said
nikolai
smiling
oh
the
uncle
said
with
surprise
looking
questioningly
at
natasha
natasha
with
a
happy
smile
nodded
affirmatively
and
such
a
one
she
said
but
as
soon
as
she
said
it
another
new
train
of
thoughts
and
feelings
arose
in
her
what
did
nikolais
smile
mean
when
he
said
hes
already
been
chosen
is
he
glad
of
it
or
not
he
seems
to
be
thinking
that
my
bolkonsky
wouldnt
approve
of
wouldnt
understand
this
joy
of
ours
no
hed
understand
everything
where
is
he
now
thought
natasha
and
her
face
suddenly
became
serious
but
that
lasted
only
a
second
dont
think
dont
dare
think
of
it
she
said
to
herself
and
smiling
sat
down
again
beside
her
uncle
asking
him
to
play
something
else
the
uncle
played
another
song
then
a
waltz
then
after
a
pause
he
cleared
his
throat
and
struck
up
his
favorite
hunting
song
late
that
evening
in
the
wood
it
was
snowing
well
and
good
the
uncle
sang
as
the
folk
sing
with
the
full
and
na239ve
conviction
that
the
whole
meaning
of
a
song
is
contained
in
the
words
alone
that
the
tune
comes
of
itself
and
that
the
tune
does
not
exist
on
its
own
but
only
just
so
for
the
sake
of
the
rhythm
which
was
why
this
unconscious
tune
of
the
uncles
as
in
the
songs
of
birds
was
so
extraordinarily
good
natasha
was
delighted
with
the
uncles
singing
she
decided
that
she
would
no
longer
study
the
harp
but
would
only
play
the
guitar
she
took
the
uncles
guitar
and
at
once
found
the
chords
for
the
song
sometime
past
nine
a
break
a
droshky
and
three
mounted
men
came
looking
for
natasha
and
petya
the
count
and
countess
did
not
know
where
they
were
and
were
very
worried
as
the
messenger
said
petya
was
carried
out
and
laid
like
a
dead
body
in
the
break
natasha
and
nikolai
got
into
the
droshky
the
uncle
wrapped
natasha
up
and
said
goodbye
to
her
with
a
completely
new
tenderness
he
went
with
them
on
foot
to
the
bridge
which
they
had
to
wade
around
and
ordered
the
hunters
to
ride
in
front
with
lanterns
goodbye
dear
niece
his
voice
cried
out
in
the
darkness
not
the
voice
natasha
used
to
know
but
the
one
that
had
sung
late
that
evening
in
the
wood
in
the
village
they
drove
through
there
were
little
red
lights
and
a
cheerful
smell
of
smoke
how
lovely
this
uncle
is
said
natasha
when
they
came
out
on
the
high
road
yes
said
nikolai
are
you
cold
no
im
perfect
perfect
i
feel
so
good
natasha
said
even
with
perplexity
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
the
night
was
dark
and
damp
the
horses
could
not
be
seen
they
only
heard
them
splashing
through
the
unseen
mud
what
was
going
on
in
that
childishly
receptive
soul
so
greedily
grasping
and
absorbing
all
the
diverse
impressions
of
life
how
did
it
all
get
laid
away
in
her
but
she
was
very
happy
as
they
drove
up
to
the
house
she
began
to
sing
the
tune
of
the
song
late
that
evening
in
the
wood
the
melody
she
had
been
trying
to
get
all
the
while
they
rode
and
finally
did
get
got
it
asked
nikolai
what
are
you
thinking
about
now
nikolenka
asked
natasha
they
liked
asking
each
other
that
me
said
nikolai
trying
to
recall
you
see
first
i
was
thinking
that
rugai
the
red
dog
resembles
uncle
and
that
if
he
were
a
man
he
would
always
keep
uncle
with
him
if
not
for
the
chase
then
for
his
tunefulness
how
tuneful
uncle
is
isnt
it
so
well
and
you
me
wait
wait
yes
at
first
i
was
thinking
here
we
are
driving
along
and
we
think
were
driving
home
but
god
knows
where
were
going
in
this
darkness
and
suddenly
well
arrive
and
see
that
were
not
in
otradnoe
but
in
a
magic
kingdom
and
then
i
was
also
thinkingno
nothing
else
i
know
you
must
have
been
thinking
about
him
said
nikolai
smiling
as
natasha
could
tell
from
the
sound
of
his
voice
no
said
natasha
though
in
fact
she
had
also
been
thinking
at
the
same
time
about
prince
andrei
and
how
he
would
have
liked
their
uncle
and
ive
also
been
repeating
all
the
way
ive
been
repeating
how
well
anisyushka
stepped
out
how
well
said
natasha
and
nikolai
heard
her
ringing
causeless
happy
laughter
you
know
she
suddenly
said
i
know
ill
never
again
be
as
happy
and
peaceful
as
i
am
now
thats
nonsense
silliness
rubbish
said
nikolai
and
thought
how
lovely
my
natasha
is
i
have
no
other
friend
like
her
and
never
will
why
is
she
getting
married
we
could
keep
driving
around
together
how
lovely
my
nikolai
is
thought
natasha
ah
theres
still
light
in
the
drawing
room
she
said
pointing
to
the
windows
of
the
house
shining
beautifully
in
the
wet
velvet
darkness
of
the
night
viii
count
ilya
andreich
resigned
as
marshal
of
the
nobility
because
the
post
entailed
very
great
expenses
but
his
affairs
did
not
improve
often
natasha
and
nikolai
saw
secret
worried
conversations
between
their
parents
and
heard
talk
of
selling
the
rostovs
magnificent
ancestral
house
and
the
estate
near
moscow
without
the
marshalship
he
did
not
have
to
have
such
large
receptions
and
life
in
otradnoe
took
a
quieter
course
than
in
former
years
but
still
the
huge
house
and
wing
were
full
of
people
and
as
before
more
than
twenty
sat
down
at
table
these
were
all
people
who
had
been
accustomed
to
the
house
almost
members
of
the
family
or
such
as
it
seemed
had
necessarily
to
live
in
the
counts
house
these
were
the
musician
dimmler
and
his
wife
the
dancing
master
iogel
and
his
family
the
old
maiden
lady
belov
who
lived
in
the
house
and
many
others
as
well
petyas
teachers
the
girls
former
governess
and
simply
people
who
for
some
reason
found
it
better
or
more
advantageous
to
live
in
the
counts
house
than
in
their
own
there
were
not
such
big
receptions
as
before
but
they
maintained
the
same
way
of
life
for
without
it
the
count
and
countess
could
not
imagine
life
at
all
there
was
the
same
hunt
increased
still
more
by
nikolai
the
same
fifty
horses
and
fifteen
coachmen
in
the
stable
the
same
expensive
presents
to
each
other
on
name
days
and
festive
dinners
for
the
whole
district
the
same
whists
and
bostons
during
which
the
count
holding
his
cards
fanlike
for
everyone
to
see
allowed
himself
to
lose
hundreds
daily
to
his
neighbors
who
looked
upon
their
right
to
play
cards
with
count
ilya
andreich
as
upon
a
most
profitable
source
of
income
the
count
walked
about
in
his
affairs
as
in
an
enormous
net
trying
not
to
believe
that
he
was
entangled
and
with
each
step
getting
more
and
more
entangled
and
feeling
himself
unable
either
to
break
the
meshes
that
ensnared
him
or
to
begin
carefully
and
patiently
to
disentangle
them
the
countess
felt
with
her
loving
heart
that
her
children
were
being
ruined
that
it
was
not
the
counts
fault
that
he
could
not
help
being
what
he
was
that
he
was
suffering
himself
though
he
concealed
it
from
the
consciousness
of
his
own
and
his
childrens
ruin
and
she
sought
for
a
means
to
remedy
the
situation
from
her
feminine
point
of
view
there
was
only
one
wayfor
nikolai
to
marry
a
rich
bride
she
felt
that
it
was
their
last
hope
and
that
if
nikolai
refused
the
match
she
had
found
for
him
they
would
have
to
say
goodbye
forever
to
the
possibility
of
mending
their
affairs
this
match
was
julie
karagin
the
daughter
of
an
excellent
virtuous
mother
and
father
whom
the
rostovs
had
known
from
childhood
and
who
was
now
a
rich
bride
owing
to
the
death
of
the
last
of
her
brothers
the
countess
had
written
directly
to
mrs
karagin
in
moscow
suggesting
the
marriage
of
her
daughter
to
her
son
and
had
received
a
favorable
answer
from
her
mrs
karagin
had
replied
that
she
for
her
part
gave
her
consent
and
that
everything
would
depend
on
her
daughters
inclination
mrs
karagin
invited
nikolai
to
come
to
moscow
several
times
the
countess
said
to
her
son
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
now
that
both
her
daughters
were
settled
her
sole
desire
was
to
see
him
married
she
said
she
would
go
peacefully
to
her
grave
if
that
happened
then
she
said
that
she
had
her
eye
on
a
wonderful
girl
and
tried
to
draw
out
his
opinion
concerning
marriage
in
other
conversations
she
praised
julie
and
advised
nikolai
to
go
to
moscow
for
the
holidays
to
amuse
himself
nikolai
guessed
what
his
mothers
conversations
were
driving
at
and
during
one
of
these
conversations
he
got
her
to
speak
quite
openly
she
told
him
that
all
her
hope
for
straightening
out
their
affairs
now
lay
in
his
marrying
miss
karagin
and
what
if
i
loved
a
girl
with
no
fortune
would
you
really
demand
maman
that
i
sacrifice
my
feeling
and
honor
for
the
sake
of
money
he
asked
his
mother
not
understanding
the
cruelty
of
his
question
and
wishing
only
to
make
a
show
of
his
nobility
no
you
havent
understood
me
said
his
mother
not
knowing
how
to
justify
herself
you
havent
understood
me
nikolenka
i
wish
for
your
happiness
she
added
and
felt
that
she
was
not
speaking
the
truth
that
she
was
confused
she
began
to
cry
dont
cry
mama
only
tell
me
that
you
want
it
and
you
know
ill
give
my
whole
life
everything
for
you
to
be
at
peace
said
nikolai
ill
sacrifice
everything
for
you
even
my
feeling
but
the
countess
did
not
want
to
put
the
question
that
way
she
did
not
want
a
sacrifice
from
her
son
she
would
have
liked
to
sacrifice
herself
for
him
no
you
havent
understood
me
lets
not
talk
about
it
she
said
wiping
her
tears
yes
maybe
i
do
love
a
poor
girl
nikolai
said
to
himself
and
what
should
i
sacrifice
my
feeling
and
honor
for
money
im
surprised
that
mama
could
say
it
to
me
because
sonyas
poor
he
thought
does
it
mean
i
cant
love
her
cant
respond
to
her
faithful
devoted
love
and
id
surely
be
happier
with
her
than
with
some
doll
of
a
julie
i
cant
command
my
feelings
he
said
to
himself
if
i
love
sonya
my
feeling
is
stronger
and
higher
than
everything
for
me
nikolai
did
not
go
to
moscow
the
countess
did
not
renew
the
conversation
about
marriage
with
him
and
saw
with
sadness
and
sometimes
with
anger
the
signs
of
a
greater
and
greater
intimacy
between
her
son
and
the
dowerless
sonya
she
reproached
herself
for
that
but
could
not
keep
from
grumbling
and
picking
on
sonya
often
interrupting
her
without
reason
grumbling
at
her
and
calling
her
my
dear
miss
most
of
all
the
kindly
countess
was
angry
with
sonya
precisely
because
this
poor
darkeyed
niece
was
so
meek
so
kind
so
devotedly
grateful
to
her
benefactors
and
so
faithfully
so
unfailingly
so
selflessly
in
love
with
nikolai
that
there
was
nothing
to
reproach
her
for
nikolai
spent
the
rest
of
his
leave
with
his
family
a
fourth
letter
came
from
the
fianc233
prince
andrei
from
rome
in
which
he
wrote
that
he
would
long
ago
have
been
on
his
way
to
russia
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
wound
which
had
unexpectedly
reopened
in
the
warm
climate
making
him
postpone
his
departure
until
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
natasha
was
just
as
much
in
love
with
her
fianc233
just
as
much
at
peace
because
of
that
love
and
just
as
receptive
to
all
the
joys
of
life
but
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
of
separation
from
him
moments
of
sadness
began
to
come
over
her
against
which
she
could
not
struggle
she
was
sorry
for
herself
sorry
that
she
had
been
going
to
waste
for
nothing
for
nobody
all
that
while
throughout
which
she
had
felt
herself
capable
of
loving
and
of
being
loved
things
were
not
cheerful
in
the
rostovs
house
ix
christmastime
came
and
besides
the
festal
liturgy
besides
the
solemn
and
boring
felicitations
of
the
neighbors
and
the
servants
besides
the
new
dresses
everybody
put
on
there
was
nothing
special
to
mark
it
as
christmastime
yet
in
the
windless
twenty
degrees
of
frost
in
the
bright
blinding
sunlight
of
day
and
the
starry
winter
light
at
night
one
felt
called
upon
to
mark
this
time
somehow
on
the
third
day
of
the
feast
after
dinner
the
entire
household
dispersed
to
various
rooms
it
was
the
most
boring
time
of
the
day
nikolai
who
had
gone
to
the
neighbors
in
the
morning
fell
asleep
in
the
sitting
room
the
old
count
rested
in
his
study
sonya
sat
at
the
round
table
in
the
drawing
room
copying
a
pattern
the
countess
laid
out
cards
nastasya
ivanovna
the
buffoon
sat
by
the
window
with
two
old
ladies
his
face
sad
natasha
came
into
the
room
went
over
to
sonya
looked
at
what
she
was
doing
then
went
to
her
mother
and
stopped
silently
why
are
you
wandering
about
so
forlorn
her
mother
asked
her
what
do
you
want
i
want
him
now
this
minute
i
want

natasha
said
her
eyes
glistening
and
not
smiling
the
countess
raised
her
head
and
looked
intently
at
her
daughter
dont
look
at
me
mama
dont
look
at
me
im
going
to
cry
now
sit
down
sit
with

said
the
countess
mama
i
want
him
why
am
i
going
to
waste
like
this
mama
her
voice
broke
off
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
and
to
conceal
them
she
quickly
turned
and
left
the
room
she
went
to
the
sitting
room
stood
thought
and
went
to
the
maids
quarters
there
an
old
maidservant
was
grumbling
at
a
young
girl
who
came
in
breathless
from
the
cold
outside
enough
playing
the
old
woman
said
theres
a
time
for
everything
let
her
be
kondratyevna
said
natasha
go
mavrusha
go
and
having
dismissed
mavrusha
natasha
went
through
the
reception
room
to
the
front
hall
an
old
servant
and
two
young
ones
were
playing
cards
they
broke
off
their
game
and
stood
up
when
the
young
lady
came
in
what
shall
i
do
with
them
thought
natasha
yes
nikita
please
go
but
where
shall
i
send
him
yes
go
to
the
yard
and
bring
a
rooster
please
yes
and
you
misha
bring
some
oats
just
a
bit
of
oats
is

misha
said
merrily
and
eagerly
go
go
quickly
the
old
man
confirmed
and
you
fyodor
go
and
get
me
some
chalk
passing
by
the
butlers
pantry
she
ordered
a
samovar
served
though
it
was
not
the
right
time
the
butler
foka
was
the
most
illtempered
man
in
the
whole
house
natasha
liked
to
test
her
power
over
him
he
did
not
believe
her
and
went
to
ask
if
it
was
true
this
young
lady
really
said
foka
pretending
to
frown
at
natasha
no
one
in
the
house
ordered
so
many
people
around
or
gave
them
so
much
work
as
natasha
she
could
not
look
at
people
indifferently
without
sending
them
somewhere
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
testing
whether
any
of
them
would
get
angry
or
upset
with
her
but
people
liked
carrying
out
natashas
orders
as
they
did
no
one
elses
what
shall
i
do
where
shall
i
go
thought
natasha
walking
slowly
down
the
corridor
nastasya
ivanovna
what
will
i
give
birth
to
she
asked
the
buffoon
who
came
from
the
opposite
direction
in
his
short
quilted
jacket
fleas
dragonflies
grasshoppers
the
buffoon
replied
my
god
my
god
its
all
the
same
thing
ah
where
shall
i
go
what
shall
i
do
with
myself
and
stamping
her
feet
she
quickly
ran
upstairs
to
iogel
who
lived
on
the
upper
floor
with
his
wife
iogel
had
two
governesses
sitting
with
him
there
were
plates
of
raisins
walnuts
and
almonds
on
the
table
the
governesses
were
discussing
whether
it
was
cheaper
to
live
in
moscow
or
in
odessa
natasha
sat
down
listened
to
their
conversation
with
a
serious
thoughtful
face
and
got
up
the
island
of
madagascar
she
said
madagascar
she
repeated
each
syllable
distinctly
and
not
answering
mme
schosss
question
about
what
she
was
saying
left
the
room
petya
her
brother
was
also
upstairs
he
and
his
tutor
were
preparing
fireworks
to
be
set
off
at
night
petya
petka
she
cried
to
him
give
me
a
ride
dowstairs
petya
ran
over
and
offered
his
back
she
jumped
on
it
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
he
went
skipping
about
with
her
no
never
mindthe
island
of
madagascar
she
said
and
jumping
off
his
back
she
went
downstairs
having
gone
around
her
kingdom
as
it
were
tested
her
power
and
convinced
herself
that
everyone
was
submissive
but
that
it
was
still
boring
natasha
went
to
the
reception
room
took
her
guitar
sat
in
a
dark
corner
behind
a
little
cupboard
and
began
to
pluck
at
the
bass
strings
picking
out
a
phrase
she
remembered
from
an
opera
she
had
heard
in
petersburg
with
prince
andrei
for
an
uninitiated
listener
what
came
of
her
playing
would
have
been
something
that
had
no
meaning
but
in
her
imagination
a
whole
series
of
memories
arose
from
these
sounds
she
sat
behind
the
little
cupboard
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
strip
of
light
coming
from
the
pantry
door
listened
to
herself
and
remembered
she
was
in
a
state
of
remembrance
sonya
walked
across
the
reception
room
to
the
pantry
with
a
glass
in
her
hand
natasha
looked
at
her
at
the
crack
of
the
pantry
door
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
remembered
light
coming
through
the
crack
in
the
pantry
door
and
sonya
passing
by
with
a
glass
yes
that
happened
too
in
the
same
way
natasha
thought
sonya
whats
this
natasha
cried
plucking
a
thick
string
with
her
fingers
ah
youre
here
said
sonya
giving
a
start
and
she
came
over
and
listened
i
dont
know
a
storm
she
said
timidly
afraid
of
being
wrong
she
gave
a
start
in
just
the
same
way
came
over
in
just
the
same
way
and
smiled
timidly
when
it
happened
before
thought
natasha
and
in
just
the
same
wayi
thought
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
no
its
a
chorus
from
the
watercarrier
dont
you
hear
and
natasha
finished
singing
the
chorus
to
give
sonya
the
idea
where
did
you
go
asked
natasha
to
change
the
water
in
the
glass
im
just
finishing
a
pattern
you
always
keep
busy
but
i
dont
know
how
said
natasha
and
wheres
nikolenka
asleep
i
think
go
and
wake
him
up
sonya
said
natasha
tell
him
im
calling
him
to
sing
she
went
on
sitting
thinking
about
what
it
meant
that
it
had
all
happened
before
and
not
resolving
the
question
and
not
regretting
it
in
the
least
was
again
carried
back
in
her
imagination
to
the
time
when
she
was
with
him
and
he
was
looking
at
her
with
amorous
eyes
ah
if
only
hed
come
soon
im
so
afraid
it
wont
happen
and
above
all
im
getting
old
thats
the
thing
whats
in
me
now
wont
be
there
anymore
but
maybe
hell
come
today
right
now
maybe
he
has
come
and
is
sitting
there
in
the
drawing
room
maybe
he
already
came
yesterday
and
i
forgot
she
stood
up
set
aside
the
guitar
and
went
to
the
drawing
room
all
the
household
people
tutors
governesses
and
guests
were
already
sitting
at
the
tea
table
the
servants
stood
around
the
tableprince
andrei
was
not
there
and
it
was
still
the
old
habitual
life
ah

she
is
said
ilya
andreich
seeing
natasha
come
in
well

here
with

but
natasha
stopped
by
her
mother
looking
around
as
if
searching
for
something
mama
she
said
give
him
to
me
mama
quickly
quickly
and
she
again
had
difficulty
holding
back
her
sobs
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
listened
to
the
conversation
of
the
older
people
and
of
nikolai
who
had
also
come
to
the
table
my
god
my
god
the
same
faces
the
same
conversations
papa
holding
his
cup
in
the
same
way
and
blowing
in
exactly
the
same
way
thought
natasha
horrified
at
the
feeling
of
revulsion
rising
in
her
against
the
whole
household
for
being
always
the
same
after
tea
nikolai
sonya
and
natasha
went
to
the
sitting
room
to
their
favorite
corner
where
their
most
heartfelt
conversations
always
began
x
does
it
ever
happen
to
you
natasha
said
to
her
brother
when
they
had
settled
in
the
sitting
room

ever
happen
to
you
that
you
feel
theres
nothing

really
boring
but
sad
as
if
it
doesnt
he
said
its
happened
to
me
that
everythings

it
suddenly
comes
into
my
head
that

die
once
in
the
regiment
i
didnt

when

i
sat
in

thing
was
that

with
a
pensive
smile
how
long
long
ago
when
we
were
still
very
little
our
uncle
called
us
to
his
study
in
his
old
house
and
it
was
darkwe
came
and
suddenly
there
stood
a
blackamoor
nikolai
finished
with
a
joyful
smile
as
if
i
dont
remember
and
i
dont
even
know
now
if
it
was
a
blackamoor
or
we
dreamed
it
up
or
somebody
told
it
to
us
he
was
gray
remember
and
his
teeth
were
whitehe
stood
and
looked
at
us
do
you
remember
miss
sonya
asked
nikolai
yes
yes
i
also
remember
something
sonya
replied
timidly
i
asked
papa
and
mama
about
that
blackamoor
said
natasha
they
say
there
wasnt
any
blackamoor
but
you
do
remember
of
course
i
remember
his
teeth
as
if
it
was
now
how
strange
it
was
as
if
in
a
dream
i
like
that
and
do
you
remember
how
we
were
rolling
eggs
in
the
reception
room
and
suddenly
there
were
two
old
women
and
they
started
twirling
on
the
carpet
did
that
happen
or
not
remember
how
good
it
was
yes
and
do
you
remember
how
papa
in
his
dark
blue
overcoat
fired
a
gun
on
the
porch
smiling
with
pleasure
they
went
through
their
memories
not
sad
old
peoples
memories
but
poetic
youthful
ones
those
impressions
from
the
very
distant
past
where
dream
merges
with
reality
and
they
laughed
softly
rejoicing
at
something
sonya
as
always
lagged
behind
them
though
they
had
memories
in
common
sonya
did
not
remember
much
of
what
they
remembered
and
what
she
did
remember
did
not
evoke
in
her
the
poetic
feeling
they
experienced
she
only
delighted
in
their
joy
trying
to
imitate
it
the
only
moment
she
took
a
real
was
when
they
remembered
sonyas
first
arrival
sonya
told
how
she
was
afraid
of
nikolai
because
he
had
a
jacket
with
cords
on
it
and
her
nanny
told
her
that
she
too
would
be
stitched
with
cords
and
i
remember
being
told
that
you
were
born
under
a
cabbage
natasha
said
and
i
remember
not
daring
to
disbelieve
it
then
but
i
knew
it
wasnt
true
and
i
felt
so
awkward
during
this
conversation
a
maid
stuck
her
head
in
at
the
back
door
of
the
sitting
room
theyve
brought
the
rooster
miss
the
girl
said
in
a
whisper
never
mind
polya
tell
them
to
take
it
away
said
natasha
in
the
midst
of
the
conversation
going
on
in
the
sitting
room
dimmler
came
in
and
went
to
the
harp
that
stood
in
the
corner
he
took
the
cloth
off
it
and
the
harp
gave
out
a
false
sound
edward
karlych
please
play
my
favorite
nocturne
by
monsieur
field
the
voice
of
the
old
countess
said
from
the
drawing
room
dimmler
struck
a
chord
and
turning
to
natasha
nikolai
and
sonya
said
you
young
people
sit
so
quietly
were
philosophizing
said
natasha
glancing
at
him
for
a
moment
and
continuing
the
conversation
the
conversation
had
gone
on
to
dreams
dimmler
began
to
play
inaudibly
on
tiptoe
natasha
went
to
the
table
picked
up
the
candle
took
it
out
came
back
and
quietly
sat
down
in
her
place
the
room
was
dark
especially
on
the
sofa
where
they
were
sitting
but
the
silver
light
of
the
full
moon
fell
on
the
floor
through
the
big
windows
you
know
said
natasha
in
a
whisper
moving
closer
to
nikolai
and
sonya
when
dimmler
had
finished
and
still
sat
there
lightly
thrumming
the
strings
clearly
undecided
whether
to
stop
or
begin
something
new
i
think
that
when
you
remember
remember
remember
everything
like
that
you
could
go
on
until
you
remember
what
was
there
before
you
were
in
the
world
thats
metempsychosis
said
sonya
who
had
always
been
a
good
student
and
remembered
everything
the
egyptians
believed
that
our
souls
were
in
animals
and
will
go
back
into
animals
no
you
know
i
dont
believe
we
were
in
animals
natasha
said
in
the
same
whisper
though
the
music
had
stopped
i
know
for
certain
that
we
were
angels
somewhere
and
visited
here
and
so
we
remember
everything
may
i
join
you
asked
dimmler
quietly
approaching
and
sitting
down
with
them
if
we
were
angels
once
why
did
we
end
up
lower
asked
nikolai
no
that
cant
be
not
lower
who
told
you
its
lowerhow
do
i
know
what
i
used
to
be
natasha
objected
with
conviction
the
soul
is
immortalwhich
means
if
i
will
live
forever
then
i
also
lived
before
lived
for
the
whole
eternity
yes
but
its
hard
for
us
to
imagine
eternity
said
dimmler
who
had
approached
the
young
people
with
a
mildly
scornful
smile
but
was
now
speaking
as
softly
and
seriously
as
they
were
why
is
it
hard
to
imagine
eternity
asked
natasha
there
will
be
today
there
will
be
tomorrow
there
will
be
always
and
there
was
yesterday
and
there
was
the
day
before
natasha
its
your
turn
now
sing
something
for
me
said
the
countesss
voice
why
are
you
sitting
there
like
conspirators
mama
i
really
dont
want
to
said
natasha
but
at
the
same
time
she
got
up
none
of
them
not
even
the
notsoyoung
dimmler
wanted
to
break
off
the
conversation
and
leave
the
sitting
room
but
natasha
got
up
and
nikolai
sat
at
the
clavichord
as
always
natasha
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
choosing
the
most
advantageous
place
for
resonance
and
began
to
sing
her
mothers
favorite
piece
she
had
said
she
did
not
want
to
sing
but
for
a
long
time
before
and
a
long
time
after
she
did
not
sing
as
she
sang
that
evening
count
ilya
andreich
heard
her
singing
from
the
study
where
he
was
talking
with
mitenka
and
like
a
schoolboy
who
finishes
his
lesson
while
hurrying
to
go
and
play
he
became
confused
as
he
gave
orders
to
his
steward
and
finally
fell
silent
and
mitenka
also
listening
stood
before
the
count
smiling
silently
nikolai
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
sister
and
paused
for
breath
together
with
her
sonya
listening
thought
of
what
an
enormous
difference
there
was
between
her
and
her
friend
and
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
her
to
be
ever
so
slightly
as
bewitching
as
her
cousin
the
old
countess
sat
with
a
happily
sad
smile
and
tears
in
her
eyes
shaking
her
head
from
time
to
time
she
was
thinking
of
natasha
and
of
her
own
youth
and
of
how
there
was
something
unnatural
and
frightening
in
this
forthcoming
marriage
of
natasha
and
prince
andrei
dimmler
having
sat
down
by
the
countess
closed
his
eyes
and
listened
no
countess
he
said
finally
that
is
a
european
talent
theres
nothing
for
her
to
learn
that
softness
tenderness
power
ah
im
so
afraid
for
her
so
afraid
said
the
countess
forgetting
whom
she
was
talking
with
her
maternal
intuition
told
her
that
there
was
too
much
of
something
in
natasha
and
that
because
of
it
she
would
not
be
happy
natasha
had
not
yet
finished
singing
when
the
enraptured
fourteenyearold
petya
came
running
into
the
room
with
news
that
the
mummers
had
come
natasha
suddenly
stopped
fool
she
shouted
at
her
brother
ran
to
a
chair
fell
on
it
and
burst
into
such
sobbing
that
she
could
not
stop
for
a
long
time
its
nothing
mama
really
its
nothingpetya
just
startled
me
she
said
trying
to
smile
but
her
tears
still
flowed
and
sobs
choked
her
servants
dressed
up
as
bears
turks
innkeepers
ladies
frightening
and
funny
brought
cold
air
and
merriment
in
with
them
first
huddling
timidly
in
the
front
hall
then
hiding
behind
each
other
they
crowded
into
the
reception
room
and
shyly
at
first
then
more
merrily
and
concertedly
songs
jigs
round
dances
and
christmas
games
began
the
countess
recognized
the
faces
laughed
at
the
costumes
and
went
to
the
drawing
room
count
ilya
andreich
sat
in
the
reception
room
with
a
beaming
smile
approving
of
the
games
the
young
people
disappeared
somewhere
half
an
hour
later
an
old
lady
in
a
farthingale
appeared
in
the
room
among
the
other
mummersthis
was
nikolai
the
turkish
woman
was
petya
a
clownthis
was
dimmler
the
hussar
was
natasha
and
the
circassian
was
sonya
with
mustache
and
eyebrows
drawn
with
burnt
cork
after
indulgent
surprise
nonrecognition
and
praise
from
the
noncostumed
side
the
young
people
decided
their
disguises
were
so
good
that
they
had
to
be
shown
to
somebody
else
nikolai
who
wanted
to
give
everyone
a
ride
over
the
excellent
road
in
his
troika
suggested
that
they
take
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
dressedup
servants
and
go
to
their
uncles
ah
youll
just
disturb
the
old
man
said
the
countess
and
theres
no
room
to
turn
around
in
his
place
if
you
go
anywhere
it
should
be
to
the
melyukovs
mrs
melyukov
was
a
widow
with
children
of
various
ages
along
with
their
governesses
and
governors
who
lived
three
miles
from
the
rostovs
that
ma
ch232re
is
a
bright
idea
the
old
count
picked
up
all
aroused
let
me
dress
up
now
and
ill
go
with
you
ill
rouse
pashette
too
but
the
countess
did
not
consent
to
let
the
count
go
he
had
had
a
pain
in
his
leg
all
those
days
it
was
decided
that
ilya
andreich
should
not
go
but
that
if
louisa
ivanovna
mme
schoss
went
then
the
young
ladies
could
go
to
mrs
melyukovs
sonya
always
timid
and
shy
was
the
most
insistent
in
begging
louisa
ivanovna
not
to
refuse
them
sonyas
outfit
was
the
best
of
all
her
mustache
and
eyebrows
were
remarkably
becoming
everyone
told
her
that
she
was
very
beautiful
and
she
was
in
an
animatedly
energetic
mood
unusual
for
her
some
inner
voice
told
her
that
her
fate
was
to
be
decided
that
night
or
never
and
in
a
mans
clothes
she
seemed
a
completely
different
person
louisa
ivanovna
consented
and
in
half
an
hour
four
troikas
with
harness
bells
and
sleigh
bells
their
runners
screeching
and
squeaking
over
the
frosty
snow
drove
up
to
the
porch
natasha
first
set
the
tone
for
the
holiday
merriment
and
that
merriment
reflected
from
one
to
another
intensified
more
and
more
and
reached
its
highest
point
at
the
moment
when
they
all
went
out
into
the
cold
and
talking
calling
out
to
each
other
laughing
and
shouting
got
into
the
sleighs
two
of
the
troikas
were
for
everyday
driving
the
third
was
the
old
counts
with
an
orel
trotter
in
the
shafts
the
fourth
was
nikolais
own
with
a
small
shaggy
black
shaft
horse
nikolai
in
his
old
ladys
outfit
over
which
he
put
a
belted
hussars
cape
stood
in
the
middle
of
his
sleigh
with
a
short
grip
on
the
reins
it
was
so
bright
that
he
could
see
the
harness
plates
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
and
the
eyes
of
the
horses
glancing
fearfully
at
their
passengers
who
were
making
a
great
noise
under
the
dark
roof
of
the
porch
natasha
sonya
mme
schoss
and
two
maids
got
into
nikolais
sleigh
dimmler
his
wife
and
petya
got
into
the
old
counts
sleigh
the
dressedup
servants
got
into
the
other
two
you
go
ahead
zakhar
nikolai
cried
to
his
fathers
coachman
so
as
to
have
the
chance
to
outrun
him
on
the
road
the
old
counts
troika
with
dimmler
and
the
other
mummers
set
off
ahead
its
runners
screeching
as
if
freezing
to
the
snow
its
deeptoned
bell
clanging
the
outrunners
pressed
themselves
to
the
shafts
and
sank
deeply
churning
up
the
snow
compact
and
sparkling
like
sugar
nikolai
set
out
after
the
first
troika
behind
him
the
rest
came
rattling
and
screeching
at
first
they
went
at
a
slow
trot
along
the
narrow
road
as
they
drove
past
the
garden
shadows
from
the
bare
trees
often
lay
across
the
road
and
obscured
the
bright
light
of
the
moon
but
as
soon
as
they
drove
beyond
the
fence
a
plain
of
snow
sparkling
like
diamonds
with
a
doveblue
sheen
bathed
in
moonlight
and
motionless
opened
out
on
all
sides
once
twice
the
front
sleigh
jolted
over
a
bump
the
next
sleigh
jolted
in
the
same
way
then
the
next
and
boldly
breaking
the
frostbound
stillness
the
sleighs
strung
out
one
after
the
other
hares
tracks
lots
of
them
natashas
voice
rang
out
in
the
frostbound
air
how
clear
it
is
nicolas
sonyas
voice
said
nikolai
turned
to
look
at
sonya
and
bent
down
to
see
her
face
more
closely
a
totally
new
dear
face
with
black
eyebrows
and
mustache
both
near
and
distant
in
the
moonlight
peeked
from
the
sable
fur
that
used
to
be
sonya
thought
nikolai
he
looked
at
her
more
closely
and
smiled
what
is
it
nicolas
nothing
he
said
and
turned
to
the
horses
again
having
driven
out
to
the
smooth
high
road
slicked
down
by
runners
and
all
cut
up
by
the
tracks
of
calked
horseshoes
visible
in
the
moonlight
the
horses
began
to
pull
at
the
reins
and
speed
up
by
themselves
the
left
outrunner
thrusting
its
head
back
leaped
and
tugged
at
its
traces
the
shaft
horse
swayed
twitching
its
ears
as
if
asking
shall
we
start
or
is
it
still
too
early
ahead
already
far
away
and
clanging
its
deeptoned
bell
zakhars
black
troika
was
clearly
visible
against
the
white
snow
from
his
sleigh
came
shouts
and
laughter
and
the
voices
of
the
mummers
well
now
my
gentles
cried
nikolai
tugging
the
reins
to
one
side
and
raising
the
whip
in
his
hand
and
only
by
the
keener
wind
that
seemed
to
rush
at
them
and
by
the
straining
tug
and
everincreasing
gallop
of
the
outrunners
could
they
tell
how
quickly
the
troika
was
flying
nikolai
turned
and
looked
back
the
other
troikas
hastened
after
them
with
shouting
and
shrieking
the
waving
of
whips
and
urging
on
of
the
shaft
horses
his
shaft
horse
rolled
steadily
under
the
bow
not
even
thinking
of
slowing
down
but
promising
to
push
on
more
and
more
when
necessary
nikolai
caught
up
with
the
first
troika
they
drove
down
some
sort
of
hill
and
came
out
on
a
wide
trampled
road
across
a
meadow
by
the
river
where
are
we
going
thought
nikolai
across
sloping
meadow
it
must
be
but
no
this
is
something
new
ive
never
seen
it
before
this
isnt
sloping
meadow
or
diomkin
hill
its
god
knows
what
its
something
new
and
magical
well
whatever
and
urging
his
horses
on
he
began
to
pass
the
first
troika
zakhar
reined
in
his
horses
and
turned
his
face
already
covered
with
hoarfrost
up
to
the
eyebrows
nikolai
gave
his
horses
free
rein
zakhar
stretching
his
arms
forward
clucked
his
tongue
and
let
his
own
go
hold
on
now
master
he
said
the
troikas
flew
on
still
faster
side
by
side
and
faster
moved
the
legs
of
the
galloping
horses
nikolai
began
to
pull
ahead
zakhar
without
changing
the
position
of
his
outstretched
arms
raised
the
hand
that
held
the
reins
no
you
dont
master
he
cried
to
nikolai
nikolai
sent
his
horses
into
a
gallop
and
outstripped
zakhar
the
horses
sent
a
spray
of
fine
dry
snow
into
the
faces
of
the
passengers
beside
them
was
a
rapid
tinkling
of
bells
and
the
tangle
of
quickly
moving
legs
and
shadows
of
the
troika
they
were
outstripping
from
all
sides
came
womens
shrieks
and
the
whistle
of
runners
over
snow
stopping
his
horses
again
nikolai
looked
around
around
him
was
the
same
magical
plain
drenched
in
moonlight
with
stars
strewn
over
it
zakhar
is
shouting
that
i
should
turn
to
the
left
but
why
to
the
left
nikolai
wondered
are

driving
to
the
melyukovs

where
and
god
knows
whats

strange
and

on
with

he
glanced
back
into
the
sleigh
look
his
mustache
and
eyelashes
are
all
white
said
one
of
those
strange
pretty
and
unfamiliarlooking
people
with
fine
eyebrows
and
mustache
that
one
i
think
was
natasha
thought
nikolai
and
that
one
mme
schoss
or
maybe
not
and
this
circassian
with
the
mustachei
dont
know
who
she
is
but
i
love
her
arent
you
cold
he
asked
they
did
not
reply
and
burst
out
laughing
dimmler
shouted
something
from
the
sleigh
behind
probably
something
funny
but
it
was
impossible
to
hear
what
it
was
yes
yes
voices
answered
laughing
here
however
is
some
sort
of
magical
forest
with
flowing
dark
shadows
and
the
sparkle
of
diamonds
and
with
flights
of
some
sort
of
marble
steps
and
magical
buildings
with
some
sort
of
silver
roofs
and
the
piercing
shrieks
of
some
sort
of
animals
and
if
this
is
indeed
melyukovka
then
its
all
the
more
strange
that
we
drove
god
knows
where
and
arrived
at
melyukovka
thought
nikolai
it
actually
was
melyukovka
and
maids
and
footmen
with
candles
and
joyful
faces
ran
out
to
the
porch
who
are
you
they
asked
from
the
porch
mummers
from
the
counts
i
can
see
by
the
horses
voices
replied
xi
pelageya
danilovna
melyukov
a
broad
energetic
woman
in
spectacles
and
an
open
housecoat
was
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
surrounded
by
her
daughters
whom
she
was
trying
to
keep
from
being
bored
they
were
quietly
pouring
wax
and
looking
at
the
shadows
of
the
figures
that
emerged
when
the
footsteps
and
voices
of
the
visitors
were
heard
in
the
front
hall
hussars
ladies
witches
clowns
bears
clearing
their
throats
and
wiping
their
frostcovered
faces
in
the
front
hall
came
into
the
reception
room
where
candles
were
hastily
lighted
the
clown
dimmler
and
the
lady
nikolai
opened
the
dance
surrounded
by
shouting
children
the
mummers
covering
their
faces
and
altering
their
voices
bowed
before
the
hostess
and
took
their
places
in
the
room
ah
its
impossible
to
recognize
them
and
natasha
see
what
she
looks
like
she
really

like

and
edward

that
hussar
just

and
the
legsi

it
voices
said
natasha
the
young
melyukovs
favorite
disappeared
with
them
into
the
back
room
asking
to
be
brought
cork
and
various
house
robes
and
mens
clothing
which
the
girls
bare
arms
received
from
a
footman
through
a
slightly
open
door
in
ten
minutes
all
the
young
people
of
the
melyukov
family
had
joined
the
mummers
pelageya
danilovna
having
ordered
a
space
cleared
for
the
guests
and
snacks
served
to
the
masters
and
servants
not
removing
her
spectacles
with
a
suppressed
smile
walked
among
the
mummers
looking
closely
at
their
faces
and
not
recognizing
anybody
she
not
only
did
not
recognize
the
rostovs
or
dimmler
but
she
could
not
recognize
her
own
daughters
or
her
husbands
robes
and
uniforms
which
they
were
wearing
and
whos
this
one
she
said
addressing
her
governess
and
looking
into
the
face
of
her
daughter
who
was
dressed
as
a
kazan
tartar
seems
to
be
one
of
the
rostovs
well
and
you
mister
hussar
which
regiment
do
you
serve
in
she
asked
natasha
that
turk
give
that
turk
some
fruit
jelly
she
said
to
the
butler
with
a
tray
their
law
doesnt
prohibit
it
sometimes
looking
at
the
strange
but
funny
steps
the
dancers
made
having
decided
once
and
for
all
that
as
they
were
dressed
up
no
one
could
recognize
them
and
therefore
not
feeling
embarrassedpelageya
danilovna
covered
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
and
her
whole
corpulent
body
shook
with
unrestrainable
kindly
oldwomans
laughter

look
at

she
said
after
russian
dances
and
singing
pelageya

all
the
servants
and
masters
together
in
one
big
circle
they
brought
a
ring
a
piece
of
string
and
a
onerouble
coin
and
played
games
together
an
hour
later
all
the
costumes
were
crumpled
and
disordered
the
burnt
cork
mustaches
and
eyebrows
were
smeared
over
sweaty
flushed
and
merry
faces
pelageya
danilovna
began
to
recognize
the
mummers
admired
how
well
the
costumes
had
been
made
how
they
especially
suited
the
young
ladies
and
thanked
them
all
for
entertaining
her
so
well
the
guests
were
invited
for
supper
in
the
drawing
room
and
food
was
arranged
for
the
servants
in
the
reception
room
no
fortunetelling
in
the
bathhouse
thats
the
scary
thing
an
old
maid
who
lived
with
the
melyukovs
said
over

the
eldest
melyukov
daughter

with
her
at
the
table
ah

natasha

her
eyes
in
terror
but
how

he

like
a
man
everything
as
it
should
be

so
he
started
he
started
persuading

and
she
should
have
kept
him
busy
talking
till
cockcrow
but
she
got
timid
she
just
got
timid
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
so
he
up
and
grabbed
her
its
a
good
thing
the
maids
came
running
in
right
then
now
why

scaring
them
said
pelageya
danilovna
mother

fortunetelling

even
now
you

to
the
barn
and

or
knocking
its
bad
if
you

grain
pouring
its

but

mama

pelageya
danilovna

pelageya
danilovna

sonya

if

may
i
louisa
ivanovna
asked
sonya
whether
playing
with
the
ring
the
string
or
the
rouble
coin
or
talking
as
they
were
now
nikolai
never
left
sonyas
side
and
looked
at
her
with
totally
new
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
only
today
for
the
first
time
owing
to
that
cork
mustache
that
he
had
known
her
fully
indeed
that
evening
sonya
was
merrier
livelier
and
prettier
than
nikolai
had
ever
seen
her
before
so
this
is
how
she
is
and
im
a
fool
he
thought
looking
at
her
shining
eyes
and
happy
rapturous
smile
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
which
made
dimples
on
her
cheeks
under
the
mustache
im
not
afraid
of
anything
said
sonya
may
i
go
now
she
got
up
they
told
sonya
where
the
barn
was
how
she
should
stand
silently
and
listen
and
gave
her
her
coat
she
threw
it
over
her
head
and
glanced
at
nikolai
what
a
lovely
girl
she
is
he
thought
and
what
have
i
been
thinking
about
all
this
time
sonya
went
out
to
the
corridor
so
as
to
go
to
the
barn
nikolai
hastily
went
to
the
front
porch
saying
that
he
was
hot
indeed
it
was
stuffy
in
the
house
because
of
the
crowd
of
people
outside
there
was
the
same
immobile
cold
the
same
moon
only
it
was
still
brighter
the
light
was
so
strong
and
there
were
so
many
stars
on
the
snow
that
one
did
not
want
to
look
at
the
sky
and
the
real
stars
went
unnoticed
the
sky
was
black
and
dull
the
earth
was
merry
fool
fool
that
i
am
what
have
i
been
waiting
for
all
this
time
thought
nikolai
and
running
down
from
the
porch
he
went
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
back
porch
he
knew
sonya
would
pass
that
way
halfway
down
the
path
there
lay
some
stacked
firewood
it
was
covered
with
snow
and
cast
a
shadow
the
shadows
of
bare
old
lindens
intertwining
fell
across
and
beside
it
on
the
snow
and
on
the
path
the
path
led
to
the
barn
the
log
wall
of
the
barn
and
the
snowcovered
roof
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
as
if
cut
from
some
precious
stone
a
tree
cracked
in
the
garden
and
again
everything
was
perfectly
silent
his
breast
seemed
to
breathe
in
not
air
but
some
eternally
young
strength
and
joy
there
was
a
patter
of
feet
on
the
steps
of
the
servants
porch
a
loud
creak
on
the
last
step
where
the
snow
lay
drifted
and
the
old
maids
voice
said
straight
straight
down
that
path
miss
only
dont
look
back
im
not
afraid
sonyas
voice
replied
and
her
little
feet
screeching
and
squeaking
in
their
thin
shoes
went
down
the
path
towards
nikolai
sonya
walked
wrapped
in
her
fur
coat
she
was
two
steps
away
before
she
saw
him
she
also
saw
him
not
as
she
had
known
him
and
had
always
been
a
little
afraid
of
him
he
was
in
a
womans
dress
with
tousled
hair
and
a
happy
smile
that
was
new
for
sonya
sonya
quickly
ran
to
him
quite
different
and
yet
the
same
thought
nikolai
looking
at
her
face
all
lit
up
by
the
moonlight
he
slipped
his
hands
under
the
coat
that
covered
her
head
embraced
her
pressed
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
which
had
a
mustache
on
them
and
smelled
of
burnt
cork
sonya
kissed
him
right
in
the
middle
of
the
lips
and
freeing
her
small
hands
put
them
to
his
cheeks
sonyanicolas
was
all
they
said
they
ran
to
the
barn
and
came
back
each
by
a
separate
porch
xii
when
they
all
set
out
for
home
from
pelageya
danilovnas
natasha
who
always
saw
and
noticed
everything
arranged
it
so
that
she
and
louisa
ivanovna
got
into
the
sleigh
with
dimmler
and
sonya
got
in
with
nikolai
and
the
maids
nikolai
no
longer
racing
drove
smoothly
on
the
way
back
and
in
that
strange
moonlight
kept
peering
at
sonya
seeking
in
that
everchanging
light
behind
the
eyebrows
and
mustache
the
former
and
the
present
sonya
from
whom
he
had
now
resolved
never
to
be
parted
he
peered
and
when
he
recognized
the
same
one
and
the
other
and
remembered
the
smell
of
cork
mixed
with
the
feeling
of
the
kiss
he
drew
in
the
frosty
air
and
gazing
at
the
earth
speeding
past
and
the
brilliant
sky
he
again
felt
himself
in
a
magical
kingdom
do
you
feel
good
sonya
he
asked
now
and
then
yes
replied
sonya
and
you
in
the
middle
of
the
way
nikolai
handed
the
horses
over
to
the
coachman
ran
to
natashas
sleigh
for
a
moment
and
stood
on
the
fender
natasha
he
whispered
to
her
in
french
you
know
ive
made
up
my
mind
about
sonya
have
you
told
her
asked
natasha
suddenly
all
beaming
with
joy
ah
natasha
youre
so
strange
with
that
mustache
and
those
eyebrows
are
you
glad
im
so
glad
so
glad
i
was
getting
angry
with
you
i
didnt
tell
you
but
you
behaved
badly
towards
her
shes
such
a
heart
nicolas
im
so
glad
i
can
be
nasty
but
i
was
ashamed
to
be
happy
alone
without
sonya
natasha
went
on
now
im
so
glad
well
run
to
her
no
wait
ah
how
funny
you
are
said
nikolai
peering
at
her
and
finding
in
his
sister
as
well
something
new
unusual
and
enchantingly
tender
which
he
had
not
seen
in
her
before
natasha
its
something
magical
isnt
it
yes
she
said
youve
done
a
wonderful
thing
if
id
seen
her
before
as
she
is
now
thought
nikolai
id
have
asked
her
long
ago
what
i
should
do
and
id
have
done
whatever
she
told
me
and
everything
would
be
right
so
youre
glad
and
ive
done
right
oh
so
right
i
recently
quarreled
with
mama
about
it
mama
said
she
was
trying
to
snare
you
how
could
she
say
that
i
nearly
had
a
fight
with
mama
and
ill
never
let
anybody
say
or
think
anything
bad
about
her
because
theres
nothing
but
good
in
her
so
its
right
said
nikolai
once
more
searching
into
the
expression
of
his
sisters
face
to
find
out
if
it
was
true
and
his
boots
creaking
he
jumped
off
the
fender
and
ran
to
his
sleigh
the
same
happy
smiling
circassian
with
a
little
mustache
and
shining
eyes
looking
from
under
a
sable
hood
sat
there
and
this
circassian
was
sonya
and
this
sonya
was
certainly
his
future
happy
and
loving
wife
having
come
home
and
told
their
mother
how
they
spent
the
time
at
the
melyukovs
the
girls
went
to
their
room
they
undressed
but
without
wiping
off
their
cork
mustaches
and
sat
for
a
long
time
talking
about
their
happiness
they
talked
about
how
they
would
live
when
they
were
married
how
their
husbands
would
be
friends
and
how
they
would
be
happy
mirrors
prepared
by
dunyasha
since
evening
stood
on
natashas
table
only
when
will
it
all
be
never
im
afraidit
would
be
too
good
said
natasha
getting
up
and
going
over
to
the
mirrors
sit
down
natasha
maybe
youll
see
him
said
sonya
natasha
lit
the
candles
and
sat
down
i
see
someone
with
a
mustache
said
natasha
seeing
her
own
face
dont
laugh
miss
said
dunyasha
with
the
help
of
sonya
and
the
maid
natasha
found
the
right
position
for
the
mirror
her
face
acquired
a
grave
expression
and
she
fell
silent
for
a
long
time
she
sat
looking
at
the
row
of
candles
going
into
the
depths
of
the
mirrors
supposing
according
to
stories
she
had
heard
that
she
would
see
a
coffin
or
that
she
would
see
him
prince
andrei
in
that
last
dim
blurry
square
but
however
ready
she
was
to
take
the
smallest
spot
for
the
image
of
a
man
or
a
coffin
she
saw
nothing
she
started
blinking
rapidly
and
left
the
mirror
why
is
it
others
see
things
and
i
dont
she
said
well
you
sit
down
sonya
you
must
do
it
tonight
she
said
in
my
placei
feel
so
frightened
tonight
sonya
sat
down
before
the
mirror
got
into
the
right
position
and
began
to
look
now
sofya
alexandrovnas
sure
to
see
something
dunyasha
said
in
a
whisper
because
you
just
laugh
all
the
time
sonya
heard
those
words
and
heard
natasha
say
in
a
whisper
and
i
know
shell
see
something
she
did
last
year
for
about
three
minutes
they
were
all
silent
shes
sure
to
natasha
whispered
and
did
not
finishsuddenly
sonya
moved
away
the
mirror
she
was
holding
and
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
ah
natasha
she
said
did
you
see
something
did
you
what
did
you
see
natasha
cried
i
told
you
so
said
dunyasha
holding
up
the
mirror
sonya
had
not
seen
anything
she
had
been
just
about
to
blink
her
eyes
and
get
up
when
she
heard
natashas
voice
say
shes
sure
to
she
did
not
want
to
disappoint
either
dunyasha
or
natasha
and
it
was
hard
to
go
on
sitting
there
she
did
not
know
how
and
why
that
cry
had
escaped
her
when
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
did
you
see
him
asked
natasha
seizing
her
hand
yes
waitisaw
him
sonya
said
involuntarily
still
not
knowing
who
natasha
meant
by
him
him
nikolai
or
him
andrei
but
why
shouldnt
i
say
what
i
saw
other
people
see
things
and
who
can
catch
me
out
about
whether
i
did
or
didnt
see
anything
flashed
in
sonyas
head
yes
i
saw
him
she
said
how
how
standing

or
lying
down
no

there
was
nothing
then
i
suddenly
saw
him
lying
down
andrei
lying
down
is
he
sick
natasha
asked
looking
at
her
friend
with
fearfully
fixed
eyes
no
quite
the
oppositehe
had
a
cheerful
face
and
he
turned
to
me
and
the
moment
she
said
it
she
herself
thought
she
had
seen
what
she
said
and
then
sonya
then
i
didnt
quite
see
there
was
something
blue
and
red
sonya
when
will
he
come
back
when
will
i
see
him
my
god
how
i
fear
for
him
and
for
myself
and
im
frightened
about
everything
natasha
said
and
without
a
word
of
reply
to
sonyas
consolations
she
went
to
bed
and
long
after
the
candle
was
put
out
lay
motionless
openeyed
on
her
bed
looking
at
the
frosty
moonlight
through
the
windows
xiii
soon
after
christmastime
nikolai
told
his
mother
about
his
love
for
sonya
and
his
firm
decision
to
marry
her
the
countess
who
had
long
noticed
what
was
happening
between
sonya
and
nikolai
and
had
been
expecting
this
talk
listened
silently
to
his
words
and
said
to
her
son
that
he
could
marry
whomever
he
wanted
but
that
neither
she
nor
his
father
would
give
their
blessing
to
such
a
marriage
for
the
first
time
nikolai
felt
that
his
mother
was
displeased
with
him
and
that
despite
all
her
love
for
him
she
would
not
yield
coldly
and
without
looking
at
her
son
she
sent
for
her
husband
and
when
he
came
the
countess
was
going
to
tell
him
briefly
and
coldly
in
nikolais
presence
what
the
matter
was
but
she
could
not
stand
it
she
wept
tears
of
vexation
and
left
the
room
the
old
count
began
hesitantly
to
admonish
nikolai
and
beg
him
to
renounce
his
intention
nikolai
replied
that
he
could
not
go
back
on
his
word
and
his
father
sighed
and
obviously
embarrassed
very
quickly
broke
off
their
talk
and
went
to
the
countess
in
all
his
confrontations
with
his
son
the
count
had
always
been
aware
of
his
guilt
before
him
for
the
disorder
of
his
affairs
and
therefore
he
could
not
be
angry
with
his
son
for
his
refusal
to
marry
a
rich
bride
and
his
choice
of
the
dowerless
sonyahe
only
remembered
more
vividly
that
if
their
affairs
had
not
been
in
disorder
they
could
not
have
hoped
for
a
better
wife
for
nikolai
than
sonya
and
that
he
alone
with
his
mitenka
and
his
insuperable
habits
was
to
blame
for
the
disorder
of
their
affairs
the
father
and
mother
spoke
no
further
with
their
son
about
this
matter
but
several
days
later
the
countess
summoned
sonya
to
her
and
with
a
cruelty
neither
of
them
expected
reproached
her
niece
for
luring
her
son
away
and
for
ingratitude
sonya
listened
to
the
countesss
cruel
words
silently
with
lowered
eyes
and
did
not
understand
what
was
being
demanded
of
her
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
her
benefactors
the
thought
of
selfsacrifice
was
her
favorite
thought
but
in
this
case
she
could
not
understand
to
whom
and
what
she
must
sacrifice
she
could
not
help
loving
the
countess
and
the
whole
rostov
family
but
neither
could
she
help
loving
nikolai
and
knowing
that
his
happiness
depended
on
that
love
she
was
silent
and
sad
and
made
no
reply
nikolai
as
it
seemed
to
him
could
not
bear
this
situation
any
longer
and
went
to
talk
with
his
mother
nikolai
first
begged
his
mother
to
forgive
him
and
sonya
and
agree
to
their
marriage
then
threatened
his
mother
that
if
sonya
was
persecuted
he
would
secretly
marry
her
at
once
the
countess
with
a
coldness
such
as
her
son
had
never
seen
replied
to
him
that
he
was
of
age
that
prince
andrei
was
going
to
marry
without
his
fathers
consent
and
that
he
could
do
the
same
but
that
she
would
never
recognize
this
intriguer
as
her
daughter
at
the
word
intriguer
nikolai
exploded
raised
his
voice
and
said
to
his
mother
that
he
had
never
thought
she
would
make
him
sell
his
feelings
and
that
if
it
was
so
he
was
saying
for
the
last
timebut
he
had
no
time
to
say
the
decisive
word
which
judging
by
the
expression
on
her
face
his
mother
anticipated
with
horror
and
which
might
have
remained
a
bitter
memory
between
them
forever
he
had
no
time
to
finish
because
natasha
with
a
pale
and
serious
face
came
into
the
room
from
the
door
behind
which
she
had
been
eavesdropping
nikolenka
youre
talking
nonsensekeep
quiet
keep
quiet
keep
quiet
i
tell
you
she
almost
shouted
in
order
to
drown
out
his
voice
mama
darling
its
not
at
all
because
ofmy
poor
dear
heart
she
was
saying
to
her
mother
who
feeling
herself
on
the
verge
of
a
breakup
looked
at
her
son
with
horror
but
being
stubborn
and
carried
away
by
the
struggle
would
not
and
could
not
give
in
nikolenka
ill
explain
you
just
golisten
mama
darling
she
said
to
her
mother
her
words
were
meaningless
but
they
achieved
the
result
she
was
striving
for
the
countess
sobbing
heavily
hid
her
face
on
her
daughters
breast
and
nikolai
got
up
clutched
his
head
and
left
the
room
natasha
took
up
the
cause
of
reconciliation
and
brought
it
to
a
point
where
nikolai
obtained
his
mothers
promise
that
sonya
would
not
be
oppressed
and
promised
himself
that
he
would
not
undertake
anything
in
secret
from
his
parents
with
the
firm
intention
of
settling
his
affairs
in
the
regiment
resigning
from
the
service
coming
home
and
marrying
sonya
nikolai
sad
and
serious
in
discord
with
his
family
but
as
it
seemed
to
him
passionately
in
love
left
for
his
regiment
at
the
beginning
of
january
after
nikolais
departure
the
rostovs
house
became
sadder
than
ever
the
countess
was
so
emotionally
upset
that
she
fell
ill
sonya
grieved
both
at
being
parted
from
nikolai
and
still
more
at
the
hostile
tone
with
which
the
countess
could
not
help
treating
her
the
count
was
more
preoccupied
than
ever
with
the
bad
state
of
his
affairs
which
called
for
some
decisive
measures
it
was
necessary
to
sell
the
moscow
house
and
nearby
estate
and
to
sell
the
house
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
moscow
but
because
of
the
countesss
health
they
had
to
put
off
the
departure
from
day
to
day
natasha
who
had
borne
the
initial
time
of
her
separation
from
her
fianc233
lightly
and
even
cheerfully
now
grew
more
and
more
troubled
and
impatient
with
every
day
the
thought
that
her
best
time
which
she
could
have
used
in
loving
him
was
being
wasted
like
that
for
nothing
tormented
her
unremittingly
his
letters
mostly
made
her
angry
it
offended
her
to
think
that
while
she
lived
only
by
thoughts
of
him
he
was
living
a
real
life
seeing
new
places
and
new
people
who
interested
him
the
more
diverting
his
letters
were
the
more
vexed
she
felt
her
own
letters
to
him
not
only
did
not
furnish
her
with
any
comfort
but
were
a
boring
and
false
duty
she
was
unable
to
write
because
she
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
truthfully
expressing
in
a
letter
even
a
thousandth
what
she
was
used
to
expressing
with
her
voice
smile
and
gaze
she
wrote
him
classically
monotonous
dry
letters
to
which
she
herself
did
not
ascribe
any
significance
and
in
the
drafts
of
which
the
countess
corrected
the
spelling
errors
the
countesss
health
still
did
not
improve
but
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
put
off
the
trip
to
moscow
a
dowry
had
to
be
prepared
the
house
had
to
be
sold
and
besides
prince
andrei
was
first
expected
in
moscow
where
prince
nikolai
andreich
was
spending
that
winter
and
natasha
was
sure
that
he
had
already
arrived
the
countess
stayed
in
the
country
and
the
count
taking
sonya
and
natasha
with
him
went
to
moscow
at
the
end
of
january
i
after
the
engagement
of
prince
andrei
and
natasha
pierre
without
any
obvious
reason
suddenly
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
on
with
his
former
life
however
firmly
convinced
he
was
of
the
truths
revealed
to
him
by
his
benefactor
however
joyful
for
him
had
been
that
first
time
of
enthusiastic
inner
work
of
selfimprovement
to
which
he
had
given
himself
with
such
ardorafter
prince
andreis
betrothal
to
natasha
and
after
the
death
of
iosif
alexeevich
of
which
he
received
news
at
almost
the
same
time
the
whole
charm
of
that
former
life
suddenly
vanished
for
him
only
the
skeleton
of
life
remained
his
house
with
his
brilliant
wife
who
now
enjoyed
the
favors
of
an
important
person
acquaintance
with
all
petersburg
and
service
with
its
dull
formalities
and
that
former
life
suddenly
presented
itself
to
pierre
with
unexpected
vileness
he
ceased
writing
in
his
diary
avoided
the
company
of
the
brothers
began
going
to
the
club
again
began
drinking
heavily
again
became
close
again
with
bachelor
companies
and
began
leading
such
a
life
that
elena
vassilievna
felt
it
necessary
to
reprimand
him
sternly
pierre
felt
that
she
was
right
and
to
avoid
compromising
his
wife
left
for
moscow
in
moscow
as
soon
as
he
moved
into
his
huge
house
with
the
dried
and
dryingup
princesses
with
its
enormous
staff
as
soon
as
he
sawon
driving
through

the

they
lived

felt
himself
at

in
a

for
him
moscow
was
comfortable

and
dirty
like
an
old

all
moscow

from

received
pierre
like
a

guest
whose
place
was
always
kept

and
vacant
for

society
pierre
was
the
most
dear
kind

and
magnanimous
of
eccentrics
absentminded
and
warmhearted
a
russian

who
had
borrowed
a
good
deal
of
money
from
him
and
taken
him
under

tutelage
he
would
have
given
everything
away
no
evening
or

at

could
do
without
him
as
soon
as
he
dropped
into
his
place
on
the
sofa
after
two
bottles
of
margaux
he
was
surrounded
and
the
talk

began

he
danced
if
there
was
a

the
young
ladies
and
girls
liked
him
because
without
paying
court
to
anyone
he
was
equally
amiable
with
them
all
especially
after
supper
il

they
said
of
him
pierre
was
one
of
those
retired
gentlemeninwaiting
of
whom
there
were
hundreds
goodnaturedly
living
out
their
lives
in
moscow
how
horrified
he
would
have
been
if
seven
years
ago
when
he
had
just
come
from
abroad
someone
had
told
him
that
there
was
no
need
to
seek
or
invent
anything
that
his
rut
had
long
been
carved
out
for
him
and
determined
from
all
eternity
and
that
however
he
twisted
and
turned
he
would
be
that
which
everybody
was
in
his
position
he
could
not
have
believed
it
had
he
not
wished
with
all
his
soul
to
establish
a
republic
in
russia
then
to
become
a
napoleon
himself
a
philosopher
a
tactician
the
defeater
of
napoleon
had
he
not
seen
the
possibility
and
passionately
wished
to
transform
depraved
mankind
and
bring
his
own
self
to
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
had
he
not
established
schools
and
hospitals
and
liberated
his
peasants
but
instead
of
all
that
here
he
wasthe
rich
husband
of
an
unfaithful
wife
a
retired
gentlemaninwaiting
who
liked
to
eat
drink
and
unbuttoning
himself
to
denounce
the
government
a
little
a
member
of
the
moscow
english
club
and
a
universally
beloved
member
of
moscow
society
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
thought
that
he
was
that
very
same
retired
moscow
gentlemaninwaiting
the
type
of
which
he
had
so
deeply
despised
seven
years
ago
he
sometimes
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
happened
to
be
leading
this
life
just
so
in
the
meantime
but
then
he
would
be
horrified
by
another
thought
that
it
was
just
so
in
the
meantime
that
so
many
people
had
entered
this
life
this
club
as
he
had
with
all
their
teeth
and
hair
and
come
out
of
it
with
not
a
single
tooth
or
hair
left
in
moments
of
pride
when
he
thought
of
his
position
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
quite
different
distinct
from
those
retired
gentlemeninwaiting
whom
he
had
formerly
despised
that
they
were
banal
and
stupid
content
and
at
peace
in
their
position
while
i
am
not
at
all
content
even
now
and
keep
wanting
to
do
something
for
mankind
he
said
to
himself
in
moments
of
pride
and
maybe
all
these
comrades
of
mine
struggled
just
like
me
sought
some
new
path
of
their
own
in
life
and
just
like
me
by
force
of
circumstances
society
breeding
by
that
elemental
force
against
which
man
is
powerless
were
brought
to
where
i
am
now
he
said
to
himself
in
moments
of
modesty
and
having
lived
in
moscow
for
a
time
he
no
longer
despised
but
was
beginning
to
love
respect
and
pity
his
comrades
in
fate
as
he
did
himself
pierre
was
not
as
formerly
overcome
by
moments
of
despair
spleen
and
loathing
for
life
but
the
same
illness
that
formerly
expressed
itself
in
abrupt
fits
was
now
driven
inside
and
never
left
him
for
a
moment
what
for
why
whats
going
on
in
the
world
he
asked
himself
with
perplexity
several
times
a
day
involuntarily
beginning
to
ponder
the
meaning
of
lifes
phenomena
but
knowing
from
experience
that
there
were
no
answers
to
these
questions
he
hastily
attempted
to
turn
away
from
them
picked
up
a
book
or
hurried
off
to
the
club
or
to
apollon
nikolaevichs
to
chat
about
the
gossip
of
the
town
elena
vassilievna
who
has
never
loved
anything
except
her
own
body
and
is
one
of
the
stupidest
women
in
the
world
thought
pierre
appears
to
people
as
the
height
of
intelligence
and
finesse
and
they
bow
down
to
her

flogged
to
death
and
a
priest
a
servant
of
that
same
law
of
love
and
forgiveness
gave
him
the
cross
to
kiss
before
the
execution
so
pierre
reflected
and
accustomed
as
he
was
to
it
this
whole
general
universally
acknowledged
lie
amazed
him
each
time
like
something
new
i
understand
this
lie
and
confusion
he
thought
but
how
can
i
tell
them
all
that
i
understand
it
ive
tried
and
ive
always
found
that
in
the
depths
of
their
souls
they
understand
the
same
thing
i
do
but
they
simply
try
not
to
see
it
therefore
it
must
be
so
but
i
what
am
i
to
do
with
myself
pierre
thought
he
experienced
the
unfortunate
ability
of
many
people
especially
russiansthe
ability
to
see
and
believe
in
the
possibility
of
goodness
and
truth
and
to
see
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
life
too
clearly
to
be
able
to
participate
in
it
seriously
every
sphere
of
work
was
in
his
eyes
bound
up
with
evil
and
deceit
whatever
he
tried
to
be
whatever
he
undertookevil
and
falsehood
repulsed
him
and
barred
him
from
all
paths
of
activity
and
yet
he
had
to
live
he
had
to
keep
busy
it
was
too
frightening
to
be
under
the
burden
of
all
the
insoluble
questions
of
life
and
he
gave
himself
to
the
first
amusements
that
came
along
only
so
as
to
forget
them
he
frequented
every
possible
society
drank
heavily
bought
paintings
built
but
above
all
he
read
he
read
he
read
everything
that
came
to
hand
so
that
on
coming
home
while
the
footmen
were
still
undressing
him
he
would
take
up
a
book
and
readand
from
reading
he
would
pass
into
sleep
and
from
sleep
to
chatter
in
drawing
rooms
and
the
club
from
chatter
to
carousing
and
women
from
carousing
back
to
chatter
reading
and
wine
drinking
wine
became
more
and
more
of
a
physical
and
at
the
same
time
moral
need
for
him
though
the
doctors
told
him
that
with
his
corpulence
wine
was
dangerous
for
him
he
drank
a
great
deal
he
felt
perfectly
well
only
when
without
noticing
how
having
poured
several
glasses
of
wine
into
his
large
mouth
he
experienced
a
pleasant
warmth
in
his
body
an
affection
towards
all
his
neighbors
and
a
mental
readiness
to
respond
superficially
to
every
thought
without
going
deeply
into
its
essence
only
when
he
had
drunk
a
bottle
or
two
of
wine
did
he
become
dimly
aware
that
the
tangled
terrible
knot
of
life
which
had
formerly
terrified
him
was
not
as
frightening
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
a
buzzing
in
his
head
chattering
listening
to
conversation
or
reading
after
dinner
and
supper
he
constantly
saw
that
knot
from
some
one
of
its
sides
but
only
under
the
influence
of
wine
did
he
say
to
himself
never
mind
ill
disentangle
itive
got
a
ready
explanation
right
here
but
i
have
no
time
nowill
think
it
all
over
later
but
this
later
never
came
on
an
empty
stomach
in
the
morning
all
the
old
questions
seemed
as
insoluble
and
frightening
as
ever
and
pierre
would
hastily
seize
a
book
and
was
glad
when
somebody
came
to
see
him
sometimes
pierre
remembered
stories
he
had
heard
about
how
soldiers
at
war
taking
cover
under
enemy
fire
when
there
is
nothing
to
do
try
to
find
some
occupation
for
themselves
so
as
to
endure
the
danger
more
easily
and
to
pierre
all
people
seemed
to
be
such
soldiers
saving
themselves
from
life
some
with
ambition
some
with
cards
some
with
drafting
laws
some
with
women
some
with
playthings
some
with
horses
some
with
politics
some
with
hunting
some
with
wine
some
with
affairs
of
state
nothing
is
either
trivial
or
important
its
all
the
same
only
save
yourself
from
it
as
best
you
can
thought
pierre
only
not
to
see
it
that
dreadful
it
ii
at
the
beginning
of
winter
prince
nikolai
andreich
bolkonsky
came
to
moscow
with
his
daughter
because
of
his
past
because
of
his
intelligence
and
originality
and
especially
because
of
the
weakening
just
then
of
the
raptures
over
the
reign
of
alexander
i
and
because
of
the
antifrench
and
patriotic
tendencies
which
reigned
at
that
time
in
moscow
prince
nikolai
andreich
at
once
became
an
object
of
special
deference
among
the
muscovites
and
the
center
of
moscow
opposition
to
the
government
the
prince
had
aged
very
much
that
year
distinct
signs
of
senility
appeared
in
him
falling
asleep
unexpectedly
a
forgetfulness
of
recent
events
and
a
good
memory
of
those
long
past
and
the
childish
vanity
with
which
he
accepted
the
role
of
head
of
the
moscow
opposition
despite
which
when
the
old
man
especially
in
the
evenings
came
out
to
tea
in
his
furtrimmed
jacket
and
powdered
wig
and
prompted
by
someone
began
his
curt
stories
of
the
past
or
his
still
more
curt
and
cutting
opinions
of
the
present
he
aroused
in
all
his
guests
the
same
feeling
of
deferential
respect
for
his
visitors
the
whole
of
that
old
house
with
its
enormous
pier
glasses
its
prerevolutionary
furniture
those
powdered
footmen
and
the
tough
and
intelligent
old
man
himself
of
the
previous
century
with
his
meek
daughter
and
the
pretty
little
frenchwoman
who
both
stood
in
awe
of
him
presented
a
majestically
agreeable
spectacle
but
the
visitors
did
not
consider
that
besides
those
two
or
three
hours
during
which
they
saw
their
hosts
there
were
another
twentytwo
hours
in
the
day
during
which
the
secret
inner
life
of
the
house
went
on
lately
in
moscow
that
inner
life
had
become
very
painful
for
princess
marya
she
was
deprived
in
moscow
of
her
best
joysconversations
with
the
people
of
god
and
solitude
which
refreshed
her
in
bald
hillsnor
did
she
have
any
of
the
advantages
or
joys
of
life
in
the
capital
she
did
not
go
into
society
everybody
knew
that
her
father
would
not
let
her
go
without
him
and
he
could
not
go
on
account
of
ill
health
and
so
she
was
never
invited
to
dinners
or
soir233es
princess
marya
had
completely
abandoned
all
hope
of
getting
married
she
saw
the
coldness
and
animosity
with
which
prince
nikolai
andreich
received
and
sent
away
the
young
men
possible
suitors
who
occasionally
appeared
in
their
house
princess
marya
had
no
friends
during
this
time
in
moscow
she
had
become
disappointed
in
the
two
persons
closest
to
her
mlle
bourienne
with
whom
she
could
not
be
fully
candid
even
before
now
became
disagreeable
to
her
and
she
for
certain
reasons
began
to
withdraw
from
her
julie
who
lived
in
moscow
and
with
whom
princess
marya
had
corresponded
for
the
last
five
years
turned
out
to
be
totally
foreign
to
her
when
princess
marya
met
her
again
in
person
at
that
time
julie
who
owing
to
the
deaths
of
her
brothers
had
become
one
of
the
richest
prospective
brides
in
moscow
was
in
the
full
whirl
of
society
pleasures
she
was
surrounded
by
young
men
who
she
thought
had
suddenly
come
to
appreciate
her
merits
julie
had
reached
that
stage
when
a
young
lady
of
society
feels
that
her
last
chance
to
marry
has
come
and
her
fate
must
be
decided
now
or
never
on
thursday
princess
marya
remembered
with
a
sad
smile
that
she
now
had
no
one
to
write
to
since
julie
julie
whose
presence
brought
her
no
joy
was
there
and
she
saw
her
every
week
like
the
old
233migr233
who
refused
to
marry
a
lady
with
whom
he
had
been
spending
his
evenings
for
several
years
because
once
married
he
would
not
know
where
to
spend
his
evenings
she
was
sorry
that
julie
was
there
and
that
she
had
no
one
to
write
to
princess
marya
had
no
one
in
moscow
with
whom
she
could
talk
no
one
to
whom
she
could
confide
her
grief
and
many
new
griefs
had
been
added
on
during
that
time
the
date
of
prince
andreis
return
and
marriage
was
approaching
and
his
request
that
she
prepare
their
father
for
it
had
not
only
not
been
fulfilled
but
the
matter
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
have
deteriorated
completely
and
any
reminder
of
countess
rostov
put
the
old
prince
beside
himself
and
he
was
almost
always
in
a
bad
mood
as
it
was
a
new
grief
recently
added
to
princess
maryas
burden
was
the
lessons
she
gave
to
her
sixyearold
nephew
in
her
relations
with
nikolushka
she
recognized
in
herself
with
horror
the
quality
of
her
fathers
irritability
no
matter
how
many
times
she
told
herself
that
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
get
angry
while
teaching
her
nephew
almost
every
time
she
sat
down
with
a
pointer
over
the
french
reader
she
wanted
so
much
to
pour
her
knowledge
quickly
and
easily
from
herself
into
the
child
who
was
already
afraid
that
his
aunt
was
about
to
get
angry
that
at
the
least
inattention
on
the
boys
part
she
jumped
hurried
became
angry
raised
her
voice
sometimes
pulled
his
arm
and
made
him
stand
in
the
corner
having
stood
him
in
the
corner
she
herself
would
begin
to
weep
over
her
wicked
bad
character
and
nikolushka
imitating
her
weeping
would
leave
the
corner
without
permission
come
over
to
her
pull
her
wet
hands
away
from
her
face
and
comfort
her
but
the
greatest
the
greatest
of
all
the
princesss
griefs
came
from
her
fathers
irritability
which
was
always
directed
against
her
and
lately
had
reached
the
point
of
cruelty
if
he
had
made
her
bow
to
the
ground
all
night
if
he
had
beaten
her
made
her
carry
firewood
and
water
it
would
not
even
have
occurred
to
her
that
her
position
was
difficult
but
this
loving
tormentorthe
more
cruel
because
he
loved
her
and
because
of
that
tormented
himself
and
herknew
not
only
how
to
insult
and
humiliate
her
deliberately
but
also
how
to
prove
to
her
that
she
was
always
to
blame
for
everything
lately
a
new
feature
had
appeared
in
him
which
tormented
princess
marya
most
of
allthis
was
his
increasing
intimacy
with
mlle
bourienne
the
thought
which
had
occurred
to
him
as
a
joke
when
he
received
news
of
his
sons
intention
that
if
andrei
got
married
he
himself
would
marry
bourienne
was
evidently
to
his
liking
and
lately
only
in
order
to
insult
her
as
it
seemed
to
princess
marya
he
had
stubbornly
shown
a
special
affection
for
mlle
bourienne
and
had
shown
his
displeasure
with
his
daughter
by
showing
his
liking
for
bourienne
one
day
in
moscow
in
princess
maryas
presence
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
did
it
in
front
of
her
on
purpose
the
old
prince
kissed
mlle
bouriennes
hand
pulled
her
to
him
and
embraced
her
affectionately
princess
marya
flared
up
and
ran
out
of
the
room
a
few
moments
later
mlle
bourienne
came
into
princess
maryas
room
smiling
and
talking
about
something
cheerfully
in
her
pleasant
voice
princess
marya
hastily
wiped
her
tears
went
up
to
bourienne
with
resolute
steps
and
apparently
not
realizing
it
herself
began
shouting
at
the
frenchwoman
with
wrathful
haste
and
a
breaking
voice
its
vile
low
inhuman
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
she
did
not
finish
get
out
of
my
room
she
cried
and
burst
into
sobs
the
next
day
the
prince
did
not
say
a
word
to
his
daughter
but
she
noticed
that
over
dinner
he
ordered
the
food
served
starting
with
mlle
bourienne
at
the
end
of
dinner
when
the
butler
out
of
old
habit
again
served
the
coffee
starting
with
the
princess
the
prince
suddenly
flew
into
a
rage
flung
his
cane
at
filipp
and
at
once
gave
orders
for
him
to
be
sent
as
a
soldier
they
dont
heari
told
them
twicethey
dont
hear
shes
the
first
person
in
this
house
shes
my
best
friend
cried
the
prince
and
he
shouted
wrathfully
addressing
princess
marya
for
the
first
time
if
you
allow
yourself
once
more
as
you
did
yesterdayto
forget
yourself
before
her
ill
show
you
who
is
master
in
this
house
out
i
dont
want
to
see
you
apologize
to
her
princess
marya
apologized
to
amalia
evgenievna
and
to
her
father
for
herself
and
for
the
butler
filipp
who
asked
her
to
intercede
for
him
at
such
moments
a
feeling
resembling
the
pride
of
sacrifice
gathered
in
princess
maryas
soul
and
suddenly
at
those
same
moments
in
her
presence
this
father
whom
she
had
judged
would
either
search
for
his
spectacles
fumbling
just
next
to
them
and
not
seeing
them
or
forget
what
had
just
happened
or
make
a
false
step
with
his
weakening
legs
and
look
around
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
his
weakness
or
which
was
worst
of
all
over
dinner
if
there
were
no
guests
to
excite
him
would
suddenly
doze
off
dropping
his
napkin
and
hanging
his
shaking
head
over
his
plate
hes
old
and
weak
and
i
dare
to
judge
him
she
would
think
with
selfloathing
at
such
moments
iii
in
1811
there
was
living
in
moscow
a
french
doctor
who
quickly
became
the
fashion
a
man
of
immense
height
handsome
amiable
as
frenchmen
are
and
as
all
moscow
said
extraordinarily
skillful
in
his
professionm233tivier
he
was
received
in
houses
of
high
society
not
as
a
doctor
but
as
an
equal
prince
nikolai
andreich
who
had
always
laughed
at
medical
science
had
recently
on
the
advice
of
mlle
bourienne
admitted
this
doctor
to
his
presence
and
grown
used
to
him
m233tivier
called
on
the
prince
twice
a
week
on
st
nicholass
day
the
princes
name
day
all
moscow
came
to
his
door
but
he
gave
orders
to
receive
no
one
and
to
invite
only
a
few
to
dinner
the
list
of
whom
he
gave
to
princess
marya
m233tivier
arriving
on
that
morning
with
his
felicitations
found
it
appropriate
in
his
quality
as
a
doctor
de
forcer
la
consigne
as
he
said
to
princess
marya
and
went
to
see
the
prince
it
so
happened
that
on
that
morning
of
his
name
day
the
old
prince
was
in
one
of
his
worst
moods
he
had
been
going
wearily
about
the
house
all
morning
picking
on
everyone
and
pretending
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
said
to
him
and
that
he
himself
was
not
understood
princess
marya
knew
only
too
well
this
mood
of
quiet
and
preoccupied
grumbling
which
usually
resolved
itself
in
an
outburst
of
rage
and
she
went
about
all
morning
as
if
under
a
loaded
and
cocked
gun
awaiting
the
inevitable
shot
until
the
doctors
arrival
the
morning
had
gone
fairly
well
having
let
the
doctor
in
princess
marya
sat
down
with
a
book
in
the
drawing
room
from
where
she
could
hear
everything
that
was
happening
in
the
study
first
she
heard
only
m233tiviers
voice
then
her
fathers
voice
then
both
voices
began
speaking
at
once
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
frightened
handsome
figure
of
m233tivier
with
his
black
forelock
and
the
figure
of
the
prince
in
his
nightcap
and
robe
his
face
distorted
by
rage
and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
rolled
downwards
you
dont
understand
the
prince
was
shouting
but
i
do
french
spy
bonapartes
slave
and
spy
out
of
my
houseout
i
say
and
he
slammed
the
door
m233tivier
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
over
to
mlle
bourienne
who
hearing
the
shouting
had
come
running
from
the
neighboring
room
the
prince
is
not
entirely
wellla
bile
et
le
transport
au
cerveau
tranquillisezvous
je
repasserai
demain
said
m233tivier
and
putting
his
finger
to
his
lips
he
hurriedly
left
behind
the
door
slippered
footsteps
were
heard
and
shouts
spies
traitors
traitors
everywhere
not
a
moments
peace
in
my
own
house
after
m233tiviers
departure
the
old
prince
called
his
daughter
to
him
and
all
the
force
of
his
wrath
fell
upon
her
it
was
her
fault
that
a
spy
had
been
let
in
to
his
rooms
yet
he
had
told
her
he
had
told
her
to
make
a
list
and
not
let
in
anyone
not
on
the
list
why
had
this
scoundrel
been
let
in
she
was
the
cause
of
it
all
with
her
he
could
not
have
a
moments
peace
he
could
not
die
in
peace
he
said
no
my
dear
we
must
part
we
must
part
let
it
be
known
to
you
i
cannot
have
it
anymore
he
said
and
left
the
room
and
as
if
fearing
she
might
somehow
comfort
herself
he
came
back
and
trying
to
assume
a
calm
look
added
dont
think
i
said
it
to
you
in
a
moment
of
anger
i
am
calm
and
i
have
thought
it
over
and
it
will
bewe
must
part
find
yourself
a
place
but
he
could
not
control
himself
and
with
that
spitefulness
which
belongs
only
to
someone
who
loves
he
shook
his
fists
at
her
obviously
suffering
and
screamed
if
only
some
fool
would
marry
her
he
slammed
the
door
summoned
mlle
bourienne
and
quieted
down
in
his
study
at
two
oclock
the
six
chosen
persons
gathered
for
dinner
the
gueststhe
wellknown
count
rastopchin
prince
lopukhin
with
his
nephew
general
chatrov
the
princes
old
wartime
friend
and
of
the
young
men
pierre
and
boris
drubetskoyawaited
him
in
the
drawing
room
having
come
to
moscow
on
leave
a
few
days
earlier
boris
had
wished
to
be
introduced
to
prince
nikolai
andreich
and
had
managed
to
win
his
favor
to
such
a
degree
that
the
prince
had
made
him
an
exception
among
all
the
young
bachelors
whom
he
did
not
receive
the
princes
house
was
not
what
was
known
as
society
but
it
was
a
small
circle
which
though
not
much
talked
about
in
town
it
was
very
flattering
to
be
received
in
boris
had
understood
that
a
week
ago
when
in
his
presence
rastopchin
had
said
to
the
commander
in
chief
in
response
to
his
invitation
to
dinner
on
st
nicholass
day
that
he
could
not
come
on
that
day
i
always
go
to
venerate
the
relics
of
prince
nikolai
andreich
ah
yes
yes
the
commander
in
chief
had
said
how
is
he
the
small
company
that
gathered
before
dinner
in
the
oldfashioned
drawing
room
with
its
high
ceiling
and
old
furniture
resembled
a
solemn
court
in
session
everyone
was
silent
and
if
they
spoke
they
spoke
softly
prince
nikolai
andreevich
came
out
serious
and
silent
princess
marya
seemed
still
more
quiet
and
timid
than
usual
the
guests
were
reluctant
to
address
her
because
they
saw
that
she
was
not
following
their
conversation
count
rastopchin
alone
maintained
the
thread
of
the
conversation
telling
about
the
latest
town
or
political
news
lopukhin
and
the
old
general
took
little
the
conversation
prince
nikolai
andreevich
listened
as
a
supreme
court
justice
listens
to
a
report
being
made
to
him
only
occasionally
indicating
by
a
grunt
or
a
brief
phrase
that
he
has
taken
into
consideration
what
is
being
reported
to
him
the
tone
of
the
conversation
made
it
clear
that
no
one
approved
of
what
was
happening
in
the
political
world
events
were
recounted
which
obviously
confirmed
that
everything
was
getting
worse
and
worse
but
it
was
striking
that
in
each
account
and
opinion
the
narrator
stopped
or
was
stopped
each
time
at
that
limit
where
disapproval
might
refer
to
the
person
of
the
sovereign
emperor
over
dinner
the
conversation
turned
to
the
latest
political
news
about
napoleons
seizure
of
the
lands
of
the
duke
of
oldenburg
and
about
a
russian
note
denouncing
napoleon
which
had
been
sent
to
all
the
european
courts
bonaparte
behaves
with
europe
like
a
pirate
on
a
captured
ship
said
count
rastopchin
repeating
a
phrase
he
had
already
uttered
several
times
one
is
only
astonished
at
the
patience
or
blindness
of
the
sovereigns
it
has
now
gone
as
far
as
the
pope
and
bonaparte
feeling
no
scruples
wants
to
overthrow
the
head
of
the
catholic
religion
and
everyone
is
silent
only
our
sovereign
protested
against
the
seizure
of
the
duke
of
oldenburgs
lands
and
even
then
count
rastopchin
fell
silent
sensing
that
he
was
standing
at
the
limit
where
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
disapprove
they
offered
him
other
lands
in
place
of
the
dukedom
of
oldenburg
said
prince
nikolai
andreich
he
moves
dukes
around
the
way
i
move
peasants
from
bald
hills
to
bogucharovo
and
my
ryazan
estates
le
duc
doldenbourg
supporte
son
malheur
avec
une
force
de
charact232re
et
une
r233signation
admirables
said
boris
respectfully
entering
into
the
conversation
he
said
it
because
on
his
way
from
petersburg
he
had
had
the
honor
of
being
introduced
to
the
duke
prince
nikolai
andreich
looked
at
the
young
man
as
if
he
wanted
to
tell
him
something
about
that
but
changed
his
mind
considering
him
too
young
for
it
i
read
our
protest
about
the
oldenburg
affair
and
was
astonished
at
the
poor
wording
of
this
note
count
rastopchin
said
in
the
careless
tone
of
a
man
judging
a
matter
that
was
very
familiar
to
him
pierre
looked
at
rastopchin
with
na239ve
astonishment
not
understanding
why
he
was
disturbed
by
the
poor
wording
of
the
note
does
it
make
any
difference
how
the
note
is
worded
count
he
said
if
the
content
is
strong
mon
cher
avec
nos
cinq
cent
mille
hommes
de
troupes
il
serait
facile
davoir
un
beau
style
said
count
rastopchin
pierre
understood
why
count
rastopchin
was
disturbed
by
the
wording
of
the
note
it
seems
there
are
lots
of
scribblers
around
said
the
old
prince
there
in
petersburg
theyre
writing
all
the
time
not
only
notes
but
new
laws
my
andryusha
wrote
a
whole
laws
for
russia
there
nowadays
everybody
writes
and
he
laughed
unnaturally
the
conversation
ceased
for
a
moment
the
old
general
cleared
his
throat
to
draw
attention
to
himself
did
you
hear
about
the
latest
event
at
the
review
in
petersburg
what
a
show
the
new
french
ambassador
made
of
himself
whats
that
yes
i
heard
something
he
said
something
awkward
in
his
majestys
presence
his
majesty
drew
his
attention
to
the
grenadier
division
and
the
ceremonial
march
past
the
general
went
on
and
the
ambassador
supposedly
paid
no
attention
to
it
and
supposedly
allowed
himself
to
say
that
we
in
france
pay
no
attention
to
such
trifles
the
sovereign
did
not
deign
to
reply
at
the
next
review
they
say
the
sovereign
did
not
deign
to
address
him
even
once
everyone
fell
silent
about
this
fact
which
referred
personally
to
the
sovereign
it
was
impossible
to
express
any
opinion
insolent
fellows
said
the
prince
do
you
know
m233tivier
i
threw
him
out
today
he
was
here
he
was
let
in
to
see
me
though
i
had
asked
them
not
to
let
anybody
in
said
the
prince
looking
angrily
at
his
daughter
and
he
recounted
the
whole
conversation
with
the
french
doctor
and
the
reasons
why
he
became
convinced
that
m233tivier
was
a
spy
though
those
reasons
were
quite
insufficient
and
unclear
no
one
objected
after
the
roast
champagne
was
served
the
guests
got
up
from
their
places
to
congratulate
the
old
prince
princess
marya
also
went
up
to
him
he
gave
her
a
cold
angry
look
and
offered
her
his
wrinkled
cleanshaven
cheek
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
told
her
that
he
had
not
forgotten
their
morning
conversation
that
his
decision
remained
in
force
and
that
it
was
only
owing
to
the
presence
of
the
guests
that
he
did
not
tell
her
so
now
when
they
went
out
to
the
drawing
room
for
coffee
the
old
men
sat
together
prince
nikolai
andreich
became
more
animated
and
voiced
his
way
of
thinking
about
the
impending
war
he
said
that
our
wars
with
bonaparte
would
be
unsuccessful
so
long
as
we
sought
alliance
with
the
germans
and
meddled
in
the
affairs
of
europe
which
we
had
been
drawn
into
by
the
peace
of
tilsit
we
had
no
need
to
fight
either
for
or
against
austria
our
politics
all
lie
in
the
east
and
in
relation
to
bonaparte
there
is
one
thingarmed
borders
and
firm
politicsand
he
will
never
dare
cross
russian
borders
as
in
the
year
seven
and
far
be
it
from
us
to
fight
the
french
prince
said
count
rastopchin
how
can
we
oppose
our
teachers
and
gods
look
at
our
youth
look
at
our
ladies
the
french
are
our
gods
and
our
kingdom
of
heaven
is
paris
he
began
to
speak
more
loudly
obviously
so
that
everyone
could
hear
him
french
clothes
french
thoughts
french
feelings
here
you
threw
m233tivier
out
because
hes
french
and
a
scoundrel
but
our
ladies
go
crawling
after
him
yesterday
i
was
at
a
soir233e
and
out
of
five
ladies
there
three
were
catholic
and
with
the
popes
permission
were
doing
embroidery
on
sunday
and
they
sat
there
all
but
naked
like
a
signboard
for
a
public
bathhouse
if
i
may
say
so
eh
prince
when
you
look
at
our
young
people
you
want
to
take
peter
the
greats
old
cudgel
from
the
kunstkamera
and
give
them
a
good
drubbing
to
beat
all
the
foolishness
out
of
them
they
all
fell
silent
the
old
prince
looked
at
rastopchin
with
a
smile
on
his
face
shaking
his
head
approvingly
well
goodbye
your
excellency
be
well
said
rastopchin
getting
up
with
his
peculiarly
quick
movements
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
prince
goodbye
dear
heartits
always
like
a
harp
listening
to
him
said
the
old
prince
holding
him
by
the
hand
and
offering
him
his
cheek
for
a
kiss
the
others
got
up
along
with
rastopchin
iv
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
and
listening
to
this
talk
and
gossip
among
the
old
men
princess
marya
understood
nothing
of
what
she
heard
she
was
thinking
only
of
whether
the
guests
had
noticed
her
fathers
hostile
attitude
towards
her
she
did
not
even
notice
the
special
attention
and
courtesy
shown
her
during
that
dinner
by
drubetskoy
who
was
already
visiting
their
house
for
the
third
time
princess
marya
turned
with
an
absentminded
questioning
look
to
pierre
who
the
last
of
the
guests
hat
in
hand
and
a
smile
on
his
face
went
up
to
her
after
the
prince
had
gone
and
they
were
left
alone
in
the
drawing
room
may
i
stay
a
while
longer
he
asked
letting
his
fat
body
sink
into
an
armchair
beside
princess
marya
oh
yes
she
said
and
her
glance
added
did
you
notice
anything
pierre
was
in
a
pleasant
afterdinner
mood
he
looked
straight
ahead
and
smiled
quietly
have
you
known
that
young
man
for
a
long
time
princess
he
asked
which
one
drubetskoy
no
not
long
and
do
you
like
him
yes

a
pleasant
young
manwhy
do
you
ask
me
that
said
princess
marya
still
thinking
about
her
morning
conversation
with
her
father
because
ive
made
an
observation
a
young
man
usually
comes
to
moscow
from
petersburg
only
with
the
aim
of
marrying
a
rich
bride
you
have
made
that
observation
asked
princess
marya
yes
pierre
went
on
with
a
smile
and
this
young
man
now
behaves
himself
in
such
a
way
that
wherever
theres
a
rich
bride
hes
there
too
i
can
read
him
like
a
book
hes
undecided
now

does

often
and
do

know
the
new
way
of

pierre
said
with
a
merry
smile
clearly
being
in
that
merry
mood
of
goodnatured
mockery
for
which
he
reproached
himself
so
often
in
his
diary
no
said
princess
marya
nowadays
in
order
to
please
moscow
girls
il

said
pierre
vraiment
said
princess
marya
looking
into
pierres
kind
face
and
never
ceasing
to
think
about
her
grief
it
would
be
easier
for
me
she
thought
if
i
decided
to
confide
everything
i
feel
to
someone
and
id
like
to
tell
it
all
precisely
to
pierre
hes
so
kind
and
noble
it
would
make
it
easier
for
me
he
could
give
me

you
consider
marrying
him
asked
pierre
ah

god
count

moments
when

anybody
princess
marya
said
suddenly
to
her
own
surprise
with
tears
in
her
voice
ah
how
painful
it
is
to
love
a
person
who
is
close
to
you
and
feelthat
you
can
do
nothing
for
him
she
went
on
in
a
trembling
voice
except
grieve
him
and
when
you
know
that
you
cannot
change
that
theres
only
one
thing
leftto
go
away
but
where

the
princess
without
finishing
began
to
cry
i
dont
know
whats
the
matter
with
me
today
dont
listen
to
me
forget
what
ive
told
you
all
of
pierres
cheerfulness
vanished
he
asked
the
princess
worried
questions
begged
her
to
tell
him
everything
to
confide
her
grief
to
him
but
she
only
repeated
that
she
begged
him
to
forget
what
she
had
said
that
she
did
not
remember
what
she
had
said
that
she
had
no
grief
except
the
one
he
knewthat
prince
andreis
marriage
threatened
to
make
father
and
son
quarrel
have

the
conversation

any
day

wish

asked
pierre
meaning
the
old
prince
princess
marya
shook
her
head
but
whats
to
be
done
there

only
a
few
months
before

its
bound

wish

me
hand
on
heart
the
whole
real
truth
what
kind
of
girl
is
she
and
how
you
find
her
but
the
whole
truth
because
you
understand
andrei
is
risking
so
much
in
doing
this
against
his
fathers
will
that
id
like
to
know
a
vague
instinct
told
pierre
that
all
these
reservations
and
repeated
requests
to
tell
the
whole
truth
expressed
princess
maryas
illwill
towards
her
future
sisterinlaw
that
she
wished
pierre
to
disapprove
of
prince
andreis
choice
but
pierre
said
what
he
felt
rather
than
what
he
thought
i
dont
know
how
to
answer
your
question
he
said
blushing
without
knowing
why
himself
i
decidedly
dont
know
what
kind
of
girl
she
is
i
simply
cannot
analyze
her
shes
enchanting
but
why
i
dont
know
thats
all
one
can
say
about
her
princess
marya
sighed
and
the
expression
of
her
face
said
yes
thats
what
i
expected
and
was
afraid
of
is
she
intelligent
asked
princess
marya
pierre
pondered
i
dont
think
so
he
said
althoughyes
she
doesnt
deign
to
be
intelligentah
no
shes
enchanting
thats
all
princess
marya
again
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
ah

much
to
love
her
tell
her
that
if
you
see
her
before
i
do

one
of
these
days
said
pierre
princess
marya
told
pierre
that
she
planned
as
soon
as
the
rostovs
arrived
to
become
close
with
her
future
sisterinlaw
and
to
try
to
get
the
old
prince
used
to
her
v
boris
had
failed
to
marry
a
rich
bride
in
petersburg
and
had
come
with
the
same
purpose
to
moscow
in
moscow
boris
hesitated
between
the
two
richest
bridesjulie
and
princess
marya
though
princess
marya
despite
her
plainness
seemed
more
attractive
to
him
than
julie
he
found
it
awkward
for
some
reason
to
court
princess
bolkonsky
during
his
last
meeting
with
her
on
the
old
princes
name
day
to
all
his
attempts
to
talk
about
feelings
with
her
she
had
responded
beside
the
point
and
had
obviously
not
been
listening
to
him
julie
on
the
contrary
though
in
her
own
peculiar
way
willingly
accepted
his
courtship
julie
was
twentyseven
years
old
after
the
death
of
her
brothers
she
had
become
very
rich
she
was
by
now
utterly
plain
but
she
thought
she
was
not
only
as
goodlooking
but
was
even
far
more
attractive
now
than
she
had
been
before
she
was
maintained
in
this
delusion
by
the
fact
that
first
of
all
she
had
become
a
very
rich
bride
and
second
that
the
older
she
became
the
less
dangerous
she
was
for
men
the
more
freely
men
treated
her
and
without
taking
any
obligations
upon
themselves
profited
from
her
suppers
soir233es
and
the
lively
company
that
gathered
in
her
house
a
man
who
ten
years
before
would
have
been
afraid
of
going
every
day
to
a
house
where
there
was
a
seventeenyearold
girl
so
as
not
to
compromise
her
and
bind
himself
now
boldly
came
to
her
every
day
and
treated
her
not
as
a
prospective
bride
but
as
an
acquaintance
who
had
no
sex
that
winter
the
karagins
house
was
the
most
agreeable
and
hospitable
house
in
moscow
besides
formal
soir233es
and
dinners
each
day
at
the
karagins
a
large
company
gathered
especially
of
men
who
had
supper
around
midnight
and
stayed
till
three
in
the
morning
there
was
no
ball
theatrical
or
promenade
that
julie
missed
her
dresses
were
always
the
most
fashionable
but
in
spite
of
that
julie
seemed
disappointed
in
everything
said
to
everyone
that
she
believed
neither
in
friendship
nor
in
love
nor
in
any
of
the
joys
of
life
and
expected
peace
only
there
she
adopted
the
tone
of
a
girl
who
has
lived
through
a
great
disappointment
a
girl
who
as
it
were
has
lost
a
beloved
man
or
been
cruelly
deceived
by
him
though
none
of
it
had
happened
to
her
people
looked
at
her
as
if
it
had
and
she
herself
even
believed
that
she
had
suffered
much
in
her
life
this
melancholy
which
did
not
keep
her
from
making
merry
also
did
not
keep
the
young
people
who
visited
her
from
passing
the
time
pleasantly
each
guest
who
came
to
them
gave
its
due
to
the
hostesss
melancholy
mood
and
then
occupied
himself
with
society
talk
and
dancing
and
parlor
games
and
tournaments
of
bouts
rim233s
which
were
fashionable
at
the
karagins
only
some
of
the
young
men
boris
among
them
entered
more
deeply
into
julies
melancholy
mood
and
with
these
young
men
she
had
more
prolonged
and
solitary
conversations
on
the
vanity
of
worldly
things
and
opened
for
them
her
albums
filled
with
sad
images
sayings
and
verses
julie
was
especially
affectionate
with
boris
she
was
sorry
for
his
early
disappointment
in
life
offering
him
what
consolations
of
friendship
she
could
offer
having
suffered
so
much
in
life
herself
and
she
opened
her
album
for
him
boris
drew
two
trees
in
her
album
and
wrote
arbres
rustiques
vos
sombres
rameaux
secouent
sur
moi
les
t233n232bres
et
la
m233lancolie
in
another
place
he
drew
a
tomb
and
wrote
la
mort
est
secourable
et
la
mort
est
tranquille
ah
contre
les
douleurs
il
ny
a
pas

julie
said
that
this
was
charming
il
y
a
quelque
chose
de
si
ravissant
dans
le
sourire
de
la
m233lancolie
she
recited
to
boris
word
for
word
a
phrase
she
had
copied
from
a
book
cest

de

dans

et

julie
played
the
most
mournful
nocturnes
on
the
harp
for
boris
boris
read
poor
liza
aloud
to
her
and
interrupted
his
reading
more
than
once
from
emotions
that
robbed
him
of
breath
meeting
at
a
large
gathering
julie
and
boris
looked
at
each
other
as
the
only
people
in
a
sea
of
the
indifferent
who
understood
each
other
anna
mikhailovna
who
often
visited
the
karagins
and
played
cards
with
the
mother
meanwhile
obtained
trustworthy
information
about
what
would
come
with
julie
what
would
come
were
the
two
penza
estates
and
the
woodlands
in
nizhni
novgorod
province
anna
mikhailovna
given
over
to
the
will
of
providence
looked
with
tenderness
upon
the
refined
sorrow
that
bound
her
son
to
the
rich
julie
toujours
charmante
et
m233lancolique
cette
ch232re
julie
she
said
to
the
daughter
boris
says
his
soul
is
eased
in
your
house
he
has
suffered
so
many
disappointments
and
he
is
so
sensitive
she
said
to
the
mother
ah
my
friend
how
attached
ive
become
to
julie
lately
she
said
to
her
son
i
cant
describe
it
to
you
and
who
could
possibly
not
love
her
shes
such
an
unearthly
being
ah
boris
boris
she
would
fall
silent
for
a
moment
and
how
sorry
i
am
for
her
maman
she
would
go
on
today
she
showed
me
reports
and
letters
from
penza
they
have
an
enormous
estate
and
she
does
everything
alone
poor
thing
they
deceive
her
so
much
boris
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
listening
to
his
mother
he
laughed
meekly
at
her
simplehearted
slyness
but
he
listened
to
her
and
occasionally
questioned
her
attentively
about
the
penza
and
nizhni
novgorod
estates
julie
had
long
been
expecting
a
proposal
from
her
melancholy
admirer
and
was
prepared
to
accept
it
but
some
secret
feeling
of
aversion
for
her
for
her
passionate
desire
to
get
married
for
her
unnaturalness
and
a
feeling
of
horror
at
renouncing
the
possibility
of
true
love
still
stopped
boris
the
time
of
his
leave
was
coming
to
an
end
all
day
and
every
blessed
day
he
spent
at
the
karagins
and
every
day
reasoning
with
himself
boris
said
to
himself
that
he
would
propose
the
next
day
but
in
julies
presence
looking
at
her
red
face
and
chin
almost
always
daubed
with
powder
at
her
moist
eyes
and
the
expression
of
her
face
which
showed
a
permanent
readiness
to
change
at
once
from
melancholy
to
the
unnatural
rapture
of
marital
happiness
boris
was
unable
to
utter
the
decisive
wordsdespite
the
fact
that
in
his
imagination
he
had
long
considered
himself
the
owner
of
the
penza
and
nizhni
novgorod
estates
and
had
allocated
the
use
of
the
income
from
them
julie
saw
boriss
irresolution
and
the
thought
sometimes
occurred
to
her
that
she
repulsed
him
but
at
once
her
feminine
selfdeception
furnished
her
with
a
consolation
and
she
said
to
herself
that
it
was
merely
the
shyness
that
comes
from
love
however
her
melancholy
began
to
turn
into
irritation
and
shortly
before
boriss
departure
she
undertook
a
decisive
plan
at
the
same
time
that
boriss
leave
was
coming
to
an
end
anatole
kuragin
appeared
in
moscow
and
naturally
enough
in
the
karagins
drawing
room
and
julie
unexpectedly
abandoning
her
melancholy
became
very
cheerful
and
attentive
to
kuragin
mon
cher
anna
mikhailovna
said
to
her
son
je
sais
de
bonne
source
que
le
prince
basile
envoie
son
fils
224
moscou
pour
lui
fair
233pouser
julie
i
love
julie
so
much
that
i
would
find
that
a
pity
what
do
you
think
my
friend
said
anna
mikhailovna
the
thought
of
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
wasting
this
whole
month
of
heavy
melancholic
duty
around
julie
for
nothing
and
seeing
the
income
from
the
penza
estates
already
allocated
and
properly
put
to
use
in
his
imagination
in
the
hands
of
anotherespecially
in
the
hands
of
stupid
anatoleoffended
boris
he
went
to
the
karagins
with
the
firm
intention
of
making
a
proposal
julie
met
him
with
a
cheerful
and
careless
air
told
him
casually
how
merry
she
had
been
at
last
nights
ball
and
asked
him
when
he
was
leaving
though
boris
had
come
with
the
intention
of
speaking
of
his
love
and
therefore
intended
to
be
tender
he
began
speaking
irritably
of
womens
inconstancy
of
how
easily
women
could
go
from
sadness
to
joy
and
that
their
mood
depended
only
on
who
was
courting
them
julie
became
offended
and
said
that
it
was
all
true
that
a
woman
needed
diversity
that
one
and
the
same
thing
all
the
time
would
bore
anyone
in
that
case
id
advise
you
boris
began
wishing
to
sting
her
but
at
that
moment
the
offensive
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
leave
moscow
without
achieving
his
goal
and
having
wasted
his
efforts
which
never
happened
to
him
in
anything
he
stopped
in
midspeech
lowered
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
her
unpleasantly
irritated
and
irresolute
face
and
said
its
not
at
all
to
quarrel
with
you
that
ive
come
today
on
the
contrary
he
glanced
at
her
to
make
sure
he
could
go
on
all
her
irritation
suddenly
vanished
and
her
anxious
pleading
eyes
were
directed
at
him
in
eager
expectation
i
can
always
arrange
it
so
that
i
see
her
rarely
thought
boris
the
things
started
and
must
be
done
he
turned
bright
red
raised
his
eyes
to
her
and
said
you
know
my
feelings
for
you
there
was
no
need
to
say
more
julies
face
beamed
with
triumph
and
selfsatisfaction
yet
she
made
boris
say
everything
that
is
said
on
such
occasions
that
he
loved
her
and
had
never
loved
any
woman
more
than
her
she
knew
she
could
demand
that
in
exchange
for
the
penza
estates
and
the
nizhni
novgorod
woodlands
and
she
got
what
she
demanded
the
bride
and
groomtobe
no
longer
mentioning
trees
showering
darkness
and
melancholy
on
them
made
plans
for
the
future
settingup
of
a
brilliant
house
in
petersburg
paid
visits
and
prepared
everything
for
a
brilliant
wedding
vi
at
the
end
of
january
count
ilya
andreich
came
to
moscow
with
natasha
and
sonya
the
countess
was
still
unwell
and
could
not
come
but
it
was
impossible
to
wait
for
her
recovery
prince
andrei
was
expected
in
moscow
any
day
besides
that
it
was
necessary
to
buy
the
trousseau
it
was
necessary
to
sell
the
estate
near
moscow
and
it
was
necessary
to
take
advantage
of
the
old
princes
presence
in
moscow
to
introduce
his
future
daughterinlaw
to
him
the
rostovs
house
in
moscow
had
not
been
heated
besides
that
they
were
coming
for
a
short
time
the
countess
was
not
with
them
and
therefore
ilya
andreich
decided
to
stay
in
moscow
with
marya
dmitrievna
akhrosimov
who
had
long
been
offering
the
count
her
hospitality
late
at
night
the
rostovs
four
vehicles
drove
into
marya
dmitrievnas
courtyard
on
old
konyushennaya
street
marya
dmitrievna
lived
alone
her
daughter
was
already
married
her
sons
were
all
in
the
army
she
held
herself
as
straight
as
ever
and
voiced
all
her
opinions
just
as
directly
loudly
and
resolutely
and
her
whole
being
seemed
to
reproach
other
people
for
all
sorts
of
weaknesses
passions
and
enthusiasms
the
possibility
of
which
she
did
not
acknowledge
from
early
morning
in
her
dressing
jacket
she
would
busy
herself
with
household
chores
then
on
feast
days
she
would
go
to
church
and
from
church
to
the
jails
and
prisons
where
she
had
some
business
of
which
she
spoke
to
no
one
and
on
weekdays
she
would
dress
and
receive
the
petitioners
of
various
social
conditions
who
came
to
her
every
day
and
would
then
have
dinner
at
dinner
substantial
and
tasty
she
always
had
three
or
four
guests
after
dinner
she
would
play
a
game
of
boston
in
the
evening
she
would
have
newspapers
and
new
books
read
to
her
while
she
herself
knitted
she
rarely
made
an
exception
for
visits
and
if
she
went
visiting
it
was
only
to
the
most
important
persons
in
town
she
was
still
up
when
the
rostovs
arrived
and
the
door
to
the
front
hall
squeaked
on
its
pulley
letting
the
rostovs
and
their
servants
in
from
the
cold
marya
dmitrievna
her
spectacles
low
on
her
nose
her
head
thrown
back
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
reception
room
and
glared
at
the
entering
people
with
a
stern
irate
look
one
might
have
thought
she
was
angry
with
them
and
was
about
to
drive
them
out
if
she
had
not
been
giving
solicitous
orders
to
her
people
at
the
same
time
about
where
to
put
up
the
guests
and
their
things
the
counts
over

she
said
pointing
to
the
suitcases
and
not
greeting
anybody

young
ladies

left

said
to
sonya
giving
a
special
shade
by
this
french
greeting
to
her
slightly
scornful
and
affectionate
attitude
towards
sonya
when
having
taken
their
things
off
and
straightened
themselves
up
after
the
journey
they
all
came

natasha
said
nothing
out
of
shyness
as
marya
dmitrievna
thought
but
in
reality
natasha
disliked
any
interference
in
the
matter
of
her
love
for
prince
andrei
which
appeared
to
her
so
set
a
all
human
affairs
that
no
one
to
her
mind
could
understand
it
she
loved
and
knew
only
prince
andrei
he
loved
her
and
was
to
come
one
day
soon
and

her

natasha
replied
reluctantly
vii
the
next
day
on
marya
dmitrievnas
advice
count
ilya
andreich
went
with
natasha
to
see
prince
nikolai
andreich
the
count
set
out
on
this
visit
in
a
cheerless
mood
deep
in
his
heart
he
was
frightened
their
last
meeting
during
the
recruitment
when
the
count
in
response
to
his
invitation
to
dinner
had
listened
to
a
scathing
reprimand
for
failing
to
provide
men
had
remained
in
count
ilya
andreichs
memory
natasha
wearing
her
best
dress
was
on
the
contrary
in
a
most
cheerful
mood
it
cant
be
that
they
wont
come
to
love
me
she
thought
everyone
has
always
loved
me
and
im
so
ready
to
do
everything
they
want
for
them
so
ready
to
love
him
because
hes
his
father
and
her
because
shes
his
sister
theres
no
reason
why
they
shouldnt
love
me
they
drove
up
to
the
old
gloomy
house
on
vzdvizhenka
street
and
went
into
the
vestibule
well
god
bless
us
the
count
said
half
jokingly
half
seriously
but
natasha
noticed
that
her
father
was
flustered
as
he
stepped
into
the
front
hall
and
asked
timidly
and
softly
whether
the
prince
and
princess
were
at
home
the
announcement
of
their
visit
caused
a
commotion
among
the
princes
servants
the
footman
who
went
to
announce
them
was
stopped
by
another
footman
in
the
reception
room
and
they
whispered
about
something
a
maid
ran
out
to
the
reception
room
and
hastily
said
something
as
well
mentioning
the
princess
at
last
an
old
footman
with
an
angry
look
came
out
and
told
the
rostovs
that
the
prince
could
not
receive
them
but
the
princess
asked
them
to
come
in
the
first
to
meet
the
guests
was
mlle
bourienne
she
met
the
father
and
daughter
especially
courteously
and
took
them
to
the
princess
the
princess
her
agitated
frightened
face
covered
with
red
blotches
ran
out
treading
heavily
to
meet
the
guests
trying
in
vain
to
appear
casual
and
affable
princess
marya
disliked
natasha
at
first
sight
she
seemed
to
her
too
well
dressed
flightily
merry
and
vain
princess
marya
did
not
know
that
before
seeing
her
future
sisterinlaw
she
had
already
been
illdisposed
towards
her
being
involuntarily
envious
of
her
beauty
youth
and
happiness
and
jealous
of
her
brothers
love
besides
this
insuperable
feeling
of
antipathy
for
her
princess
marya
was
also
troubled
just
then
because
when
the
arrival
of
the
rostovs
was
announced
the
prince
had
cried
out
that
he
did
not
want
them
that
princess
marya
could
receive
them
if
she
liked
but
that
they
were
not
to
be
admitted
to
him
princess
marya
had
decided
to
receive
the
rostovs
but
was
afraid
every
moment
that
the
prince
might
perform
some
escapade
being
very
agitated
by
the
rostovs
arrival
well
dear
princess
here
ive
brought
you
my
singer
said
the
count
scraping
and
looking
around
uneasily
as
if
fearing
the
old
prince
might
walk
in
im
so
glad
youll
be
getting
acquainted
a
pity
a
pity
the
prince
is
unwell
and
having
said
a
few
more
general
phrases
he
got
up
if
you
will
permit
me
princess
to
deposit
my
natasha
here
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ill
drive
over
to
the
dogs
square
just
two
steps
away
to
see
anna
semyonovna
and
come
back
for
her
ilya
andreich
had
invented
this
diplomatic
ruse
in
order
to
give
natashas
future
sisterinlaw
the
freedom
to
talk
with
her
as
he
later
explained
to
her
and
also
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
meeting
the
prince
whom
he
feared
he
had
not
said
that
to
his
daughter
but
natasha
understood
her
fathers
fear
and
anxiety
and
felt
offended
she
blushed
for
her
father
became
still
angrier
for
having
blushed
and
gave
the
princess
a
bold
defiant
look
which
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
anyone
the
princess
told
the
count
that
she
was
very
glad
and
only
asked
him
to
stay
longer
at
anna
semyonovnas
and
ilya
andreich
left
mlle
bourienne
despite
the
anxious
glances
cast
at
her
by
princess
marya
who
wished
to
talk
privately
with
natasha
would
not
leave
the
room
and
carried
on
a
steady
conversation
about
moscow
pleasures
and
theaters
natasha
was
offended
by
the
confusion
that
had
taken
place
in
the
front
hall
by
her
fathers
uneasiness
and
by
the
unnatural
tone
of
the
princess
who
as
it
seemed
to
natasha
was
doing
her
a
favor
by
receiving
her
and
therefore
she
found
everything
disagreeable
she
did
not
like
princess
marya
she
found
her
very
plain
affected
and
dry
natasha
suddenly
shrank
morally
and
involuntarily
adopted
such
a
casual
tone
that
it
made
her
still
more
repellent
to
princess
marya
after
five
minutes
of
painful
false
conversation
they
heard
slippered
footsteps
rapidly
approaching
princess
maryas
face
showed
fear
the
door
to
the
room
opened
and
the
prince
came
in
wearing
a
white
nightcap
and
a
dressing
gown
ah
miss
he
said
miss
countesscountess
rostov
if
im
not
mistakeni
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
your
pardoni
didnt
know
miss
as
god
is
my
witness
i
had
no
idea
youd
honored
us
with
a
visit
i
was
coming
to
my
daughter
in
this
attire
i
beg
your
pardonas
god
is
my
witness
i
didnt
know
he
repeated
stressing
the
word
god
so
unnaturally
and
so
unpleasantly
that
princess
marya
stood
with
her
eyes
cast
down
not
daring
to
look
either
at
her
father
or
at
natasha
natasha
having
risen
and
curtsied
also
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
herself
mlle
bourienne
alone
smiled
pleasantly
i
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
your
pardon
as
god
is
my
witness
i
didnt
know
the
old
man
muttered
and
having
looked
natasha
up
and
down
he
left
mlle
bourienne
was
the
first
to
recover
after
this
apparition
and
began
talking
about
the
princes
ill
health
natasha
and
princess
marya
silently
looked
at
each
other
and
the
longer
they
looked
at
each
other
silently
without
saying
what
they
needed
to
say
the
more
illwilled
were
their
thoughts
about
each
other
when
the
count
came
back
natasha
was
discourteously
glad
of
it
and
hastened
to
leave
at
that
moment
she
almost
hated
this
old
dry
princess
who
could
put
her
in
such
an
awkward
position
and
spend
half
an
hour
with
her
while
saying
nothing
about
prince
andrei
i
couldnt
be
the
first
to
start
talking
about
him
in
front
of
this
frenchwoman
thought
natasha
princess
marya
meanwhile
was
suffering
over
the
same
thing
she
knew
what
she
needed
to
say
to
natasha
but
she
also
could
not
do
it
because
mlle
bourienne
hindered
her
and
because
she
herself
did
not
know
why
it
was
so
hard
for
her
to
start
talking
about
this
marriage
when
the
count
was
already
leaving
the
room
princess
marya
went
up
to
natasha
with
quick
steps
took
her
by
the
hands
and
sighing
deeply
said
wait
i
must
natasha
looked
at
princess
marya
mockingly
not
knowing
why
herself
dear
natalie
said
princess
marya
please
know
that
i
am
glad
my
brother
has
found
happiness
she
stopped
feeling
that
she
was
saying
an
untruth
natasha
noticed
this
pause
and
guessed
the
reason
for
it
i
think
princess
that
now
is
not
the
right
time
to
speak
of
it
natasha
said
with
outward
dignity
and
coldness
and
with
tears
that
she
could
feel
in
her
throat
what
have
i
said
what
have
i
done
she
thought
as
soon
as
she
left
the
room
they
waited
dinner
a
long
time
that
day
for
natasha
she
sat
in
her
room
and
wept
like
a
child
blowing
her
nose
and
sobbing
sonya
stood
over
her
and
kissed
her
hair
natasha
what
is
it
she
was
saying
what
do
you
care
about
them
it
will
all
pass
natasha
no
if
you
only
knew
how
offensive
it
wasas
if
i
dont
say
it
natasha
its
not
your
fault
so
what
do
you
care
kiss
me
said
sonya
natasha
raised
her
head
kissed
her
friend
on
the
lips
and
pressed
her
wet
face
to
her
i
cant
tell
i
dont
know
its
nobodys
fault
said
natasha
its
my
fault
but
its
all
terribly
painful
oh
why
doesnt
he
come
she
came
out
for
dinner
with
red
eyes
marya
dmitrievna
who
knew
how
the
prince
had
received
the
rostovs
pretended
not
to
notice
natashas
upset
face
and
bantered
firmly
and
loudly
with
the
count
and
the
other
guests
at
the
table
viii
that
evening
the
rostovs
went
to
the
opera
for
which
marya
dmitrievna
had
obtained
tickets
natasha
did
not
want
to
go
but
she
could
not
reject
marya
dmitrievnas
kindness
which
was
meant
exclusively
for
her
when
she
came
out
dressed
to
the
reception
room
and
looking
in
the
big
mirror
while
waiting
for
her
father
saw
that
she
was
pretty
very
pretty
she
felt
still
more
sad
but
this
was
a
sweet
and
amorous
sadness
my
god
if
he
were
here
i
wouldnt
do
it
like
before
with
such
stupid
shyness
at
something
id
embrace
him
in
a
new
way
simply
id
press
myself
to
him
make
him
look
at
me
with
those
searching
curious
eyes
with
which
he
looked
at
me
so
often
and
then
id
make
him
laugh
as
he
laughed
then
and
his
eyeshow
i
see
those
eyes
thought
natasha
and
what
do
his
father
and
sister
matter
to
me
i
love
him
alone
him
with
his
face
and
eyes
with
his
manly
and
at
the
same
time
childlike
smileno
better
not
to
think
about
him
not
to
think
to
forget
forget
completely
for
the
time
being
i
wont
survive
this
waiting
ill
start
sobbing
right
now
and
she
left
the
mirror
making
an
effort
not
to
burst
into
tears
and
how
can
sonya
love
nikolenka
so
steadily
so
peacefully
and
wait
so
long
and
patiently
she
wondered
looking
at
sonya
who
was
coming
in
also
dressed
holding
a
fan
no
shes
quite
different
i
cant
natasha
felt
so
softened
and
tenderhearted
at
that
moment
that
it
was
not
enough
for
her
to
love
and
know
that
she
was
loved
she
had
to
embrace
the
beloved
man
now
at
once
and
speak
and
hear
from
him
the
words
of
love
which
so
filled
her
heart
while
she
was
riding
in
the
carriage
sitting
beside
her
father
and
looking
pensively
at
the
lights
of
the
street
lamps
flashing
in
the
frozen
window
she
felt
herself
still
more
in
love
and
more
sad
and
forgot
where
she
was
going
and
with
whom
falling
in
with
the
line
of
carriages
its
wheels
squeaking
slowly
over
the
snow
the
rostovs
carriage
drove
up
to
the
theater
natasha
and
sonya
quickly
jumped
out
holding
up
their
skirts
the
count
got
out
supported
by
the
footmen
and
the
three
walked
among
the
entering
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
the
program
sellers
to
the
aisle
leading
to
the
box
seats
sounds
of
music
were
already
coming
from
behind
the
closed
doors
natalie
vos
cheveux
sonya
whispered
an
usher
deferentially
and
hastily
slipped
sideways
before
the
ladies
and
opened
the
door
to
the
box
the
sounds
of
music
became
more
vivid
through
the
door
shone
the
brightly
lit
rows
of
boxes
with
the
bare
shoulders
and
arms
of
ladies
and
the
noisy
parterre
brilliant
with
uniforms
the
lady
who
was
entering
the
next
box
looked
natasha
over
with
envious
feminine
eyes
the
curtain
had
not
yet
gone
up
and
the
overture
was
being
played
natasha
smoothing
her
dress
walked
in
together
with
sonya
and
sat
down
looking
over
the
litup
rows
of
boxes
opposite
for
a
long
time
she
had
not
experienced
that
feeling
both
pleasant
and
unpleasant
of
hundreds
of
eyes
looking
at
her
bare
arms
and
neck
which
suddenly
seized
her
now
calling
up
a
whole
swarm
of
memories
desires
and
emotions
corresponding
to
that
feeling
the
two
remarkably
pretty
girls
natasha
and
sonya
along
with
count
ilya
andreich
who
had
not
appeared
in
moscow
for
a
long
time
attracted
general
attention
besides
everyone
knew
vaguely
of
natashas
betrothal
to
prince
andrei
knew
that
since
then
the
rostovs
had
been
living
in
the
country
and
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
fianc233e
of
one
of
the
best
matches
in
russia
natasha
had
grown
prettier
in
the
country
as
everybody
told
her
and
that
evening
owing
to
her
agitated
state
she
was
especially
pretty
she
struck
people
by
her
fullness
of
life
and
beauty
combined
with
her
indifference
to
everything
around
her
her
black
eyes
gazed
at
the
crowd
without
seeking
anyone
her
slender
arm
bared
above
the
elbow
rested
on
the
velvet
rail
her
hand
opening
and
closing
obviously
unconsciously
in
time
with
the
overture
crumpling
the
program
look
theres
miss
alenin
said
sonya
with
her
mother
i
think
good
heavens
mikhail
kirilych

grown
still
fatter
said
the
old
count
look

see
at
once

engaged
drubetskoys
made
a
proposal
yes
indeed
i
found
out
today
said
shinshin
coming
into
the
rostovs
box
natasha
followed
the
direction
of
her
fathers
gaze
and
saw
julie
who
with
pearls
on
her
fat
red
neck
which
natasha
knew
was
daubed
with
powder
was
sitting
with
a
happy
look
next
to
her
mother
behind
them
boriss
head
could
be
seen
handsome
smoothly
combed
smiling
its
ear
inclined
to
julies
mouth
he
looked
at
the
rostovs
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
smiling
said
something
to
his
fianc233e
theyre
talking
about
us
about
me
and
him
natasha
thought
and
he
must
be
calming
his
fianc233es
jealousy
of
me
they
neednt
worry
if
only
they
knew
how
little
i
care
about
them
all
behind
them
in
a
green
toque
with
a
happy
festive
face
given
over
to
the
will
of
god
sat
anna
mikhailovna
in
their
box
hung
that
atmosphere
of
an
engaged
couple
which
natasha
knew
and
loved
so
well
she
turned
away
and
suddenly
all
that
had
been
humiliating
in
her
morning
visit
recalled
itself
to
her
what
right
has
he
not
to
want
to
receive
me
into
his
family
ah
better
not
to
think
about
it
not
to
think
till
he
comes
she
said
to
herself
and
began
looking
at
the
familiar
and
unfamiliar
faces
in
the
parterre
at
the
front
of
the
parterre
right
in
the
middle
his
back
leaning
on
the
rail
stood
dolokhov
with
a
huge
mop
of
curly
hair
combed
upwards
in
persian
dress
he
stood
in
full
view
of
the
theater
aware
that
he
was
attracting
the
attention
of
the
entire
audience
as
freely
as
if
he
was
standing
in
his
own
room
around
him
in
a
cluster
stood
the
most
brilliant
young
men
of
moscow
and
he
was
clearly
the
first
among
them
count
ilya
andreich
laughing
nudged
the
blushing
sonya
pointing
to
her

shinshin
dolokhov
and
anatole

driven
all
our
ladies
out
of
their
minds
a
tall
beautiful
lady
entered
the
neighboring
box
with
an
enormous
braid
and
very
bared
white
full
shoulders
and
neck
on
which
hung
a
double
string
of
big
pearls
she
took
a
long
time
to
settle
herself
rustling
her
heavy
silk
gown
natasha
involuntarily
gazed
at
that
neck
the
shoulders
the
pearls
the
coiffure
and
admired
the
beauty
of
the
shoulders
and
pearls
as
natasha
looked
at
her
a
second
time
the
lady
turned
and
meeting
count
ilya
andreichs
eyes
nodded
to
him
and
smiled

was
countess
bezukhov

h233l232ne
and
she
looked
attentively
at
natasha
count
ilya
andreich
sat
back
in
his
place
fine
woman
isnt
she
he
whispered
to
natasha
wonderful
said
natasha
one
could
just
fall
in
love
with
her
at
that
moment
the
last
chords
of
the
overture
sounded
and
the
conductor
tapped
with
his
baton
the
latecoming
men
went
to
their
seats
in
the
parterre
and
the
curtain
rose
as
soon
as
the
curtain
rose
the
boxes
and
parterre
all
fell
silent
and
all
the
men
old
and
young
in
uniforms
and
tailcoats
all
the
women
in
precious
stones
on
bare
bodies
with
greedy
curiosity
turned
their
attention
to
the
stage
natasha
also
began
to
look
ix
the
stage
consisted
of
flat
boards
in
the
middle
with
painted
pieces
of
cardboard
on
the
sides
representing
trees
and
canvas
stretched
over
boards
at
the
back
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
sat
girls
in
red
bodices
and
white
skirts
one
very
fat
in
a
white
silk
dress
sat
a
a
low
stool
with
a
piece
of
green
cardboard
glued
to
the
back
of
it
they
were
all
singing
something
when
they
finished
their
song
the
girl
in
white
went
up
to
the
prompters
box
and
a
man
with
tight
silk
breeches
on
his
fat
legs
and
with
a
feather
and
a
dagger
came
up
to
her
and
began
singing
and
spreading
his
arms
the
man
in
tight
breeches
sang
alone
then
she
sang
then
they
both
fell
silent
music
began
to
play
and
the
man
began
to
touch
the
hand
of
the
girl
in
the
white
dress
with
his
fingers
evidently
waiting
for
the
beat
again
so
as
to
begin
his
her
they
sang
together
and
everybody
in
the
theater
clapped
and
shouted
and
the
man
and
woman
on
stage
who
represented
lovers
began
to
bow
smiling
and
spreading
their
arms
after
the
country
and
with
the
serious
mood
she
was
in
natasha
found
all
this
wild
and
astonishing
she
was
unable
to
follow
the
course
of
the
opera
she
could
not
even
hear
the
music
she
saw
only
painted
cardboard
and
strangely
dressedup
men
and
women
who
moved
talked
and
sang
strangely
in
the
bright
light
she
knew
what
it
was
all
supposed
to
represent
but
it
was
all
so
pretentiously
false
and
unnatural
that
she
first
felt
embarrassed
for
the
performers
and
then
found
them
ridiculous
she
looked
around
at
the
faces
of
the
spectators
seeking
in
them
the
same
feeling
of
mockery
and
perplexity
that
was
in
her
but
all
the
faces
were
attentive
to
what
was
taking
place
on
stage
and
expressed
admirationfeigned
as
it
seemed
to
natasha
that
must
be
how
its
supposed
to
be
she
thought
she
kept
looking
alternately
now
at
the
rows
of
pomaded
heads
in
the
parterre
now
at
the
bare
women
in
the
boxes
particularly
at
her
neighbor
h233l232ne
who
totally
undressed
with
a
quiet
and
calm
smile
never
took
her
eyes
off
the
stage
sensing
the
bright
light
spread
all
through
the
theater
and
the
warm
air
heated
by
the
crowd
natasha
was
gradually
beginning
to
get
into
a
state
of
inebriation
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
remember
who
she
was
and
where
she
was
and
what
was
happening
before
her
she
looked
and
thought
and
the
strangest
thoughts
flashed
through
her
head
unexpectedly
without
connection
now
the
thought
came
to
her
of
jumping
up
to
the
footlights
and
singing
the
aria
the
actress
was
singing
then
she
wanted
to
touch
a
little
old
man
who
was
sitting
not
far
away
with
her
fan
then
to
lean
over
to
h233l232ne
and
tickle
her
at
one
of
the
moments
when
everything
was
hushed
onstage
waiting
for
an
aria
to
begin
the
front
door
creaked
and
over
the
carpet
of
the
parterre
on
the
side
where
the
rostovs
box
was
the
footsteps
of
a
late
arrival
were
heard
heres
kuragin
shinshin
whispered
countess
bezukhov
turned
smiling
to
the
entering
man
natasha
followed
h233l232nes
gaze
and
saw
an
extraordinarily
handsome
adjutant
approaching
their
box
with
a
selfassured
and
at
the
same
time
courteous
air
this
was
anatole
kuragin
whom
she
had
seen
and
noticed
at
a
petersburg
ball
long
ago
he
was
now
in
an
adjutants
uniform
with
one
epaulette
and
an
aiguillette
he
walked
with
a
restrained
swagger
that
would
have
been
ridiculous
if
he
had
not
been
so
goodlooking
and
if
his
handsome
face
had
not
borne
an
expression
of
such
benevolent
satisfaction
and
good
cheer
though
the
performance
was
going
on
he
walked
down
the
slanting
carpet
of
the
aisle
unhurriedly
lightly
jingling
his
spurs
and
saber
bearing
his
handsome
perfumed
head
smoothly
aloft
having
glanced
at
natasha
he
went
up
to
his
sister
placed
his
tightly
gloved
hand
on
the
edge
of
her
box
nodded
to
her
and
leaning
over
asked
her
something
pointing
to
natasha
mais
charmante
he
said
evidently
about
natasha
as
she
did
not
so
much
hear
as
understand
from
the
movement
of
his
lips
then
he
walked
to
the
front
row
and
sat
down
next
to
dolokhov
nudging
with
his
elbow
in
a
friendly
and
casual
way
that
same
dolokhov
whom
others
treated
so
fawningly
he
smiled
at
him
with
a
merry
wink
and
rested
his
foot
against
the
rail
how
alike
the
brother
and
sister
are
said
the
count
and
both
so
handsome
shinshin
began
telling
the
count
in
a
low
voice
the
story
of
some
intrigue
of
kuragins
in
moscow
which
natasha
listened
in
on
precisely
because
he
had
said
charmante
of
her
the
first
act
was
over
everyone
in
the
parterre
stood
up
mingled
began
coming
and
going
boris
came
to
the
rostovs
box
received
their
felicitations
with
great
simplicity
and
raising
his
eyebrows
with
a
distracted
smile
conveyed
to
natasha
and
sonya
his
fianc233es
request
that
they
be
present
at
her
wedding
and
left
natasha
spoke
to
him
with
a
merry
and
flirtatious
smile
and
offered
to
that
same
boris
with
whom
she
had
once
been
in
love
her
felicitations
on
his
marriage
in
the
state
of
inebriation
she
was
in
everything
seemed
simple
and
natural
the
bare
h233l232ne
sat
next
to
her
and
smiled
identically
at
everyone
and
natasha
smiled
at
boris
in
the
same
way
h233l232nes
box
was
filled
and
surrounded
on
the
parterre
side
by
the
most
wellborn
and
intelligent
men
who
seemed
to
vie
with
one
another
in
their
wish
to
show
everyone
that
they
were
acquainted
with
her
throughout
this
entracte
kuragin
stood
with
dolokhov
in
front
by
the
footlights
gazing
at
the
rostovs
box
natasha
knew
he
was
talking
about
her
and
that
afforded
her
pleasure
she
even
turned
so
that
he
could
see
her
in
profile
which
to
her
mind
was
the
most
advantageous
position
before
the
start
of
the
second
act
the
figure
of
pierre
whom
the
rostovs
had
not
seen
since
their
arrival
appeared
in
the
parterre
his
face
was
sad
and
he
had
grown
still
fatter
since
the
last
time
natasha
saw
him
not
noticing
anyone
he
walked
to
the
front
rows
anatole
went
up
to
him
and
began
saying
something
to
him
looking
and
pointing
at
the
rostovs
box
pierre
seeing
natasha
became
animated
and
hastening
along
the
rows
went
to
their
box
on
reaching
them
he
leaned
on
his
elbows
and
smiling
talked
with
natasha
for
a
long
time
during
her
conversation
with
pierre
natasha
heard
a
mans
voice
in
countess
bezukhovs
box
and
somehow
knew
it
was
kuragin
she
turned
and
their
eyes
met
he
almost
smiling
looked
her
straight
in
the
eye
with
such
an
admiring
tender
gaze
that
it
seemed
strange
to
be
so
near
him
to
look
at
him
that
way
to
be
so
certain
that
he
liked
her
and
not
be
acquainted
with
him
in
the
second
act
there
were
pieces
of
cardboard
representing
monuments
and
there
was
a
hole
in
the
canvas
representing
the
moon
and
the
shades
were
raised
over
the
footlights
and
the
horns
and
double
basses
began
to
play
in
the
bass
clef
and
from
right
and
left
came
many
people
in
black
mantles
the
people
began
to
wave
their
arms
and
in
their
hands
there
were
something
like
daggers
then
some
other
people
came
running
and
began
to
drag
away
the
girl
who
used
to
be
wearing
a
white
dress
and
was
now
wearing
a
light
blue
one
they
did
not
drag
her
away
at
once
but
sang
with
her
for
a
long
time
and
only
then
dragged
her
away
and
in
the
wings
something
iron
was
struck
three
times
and
everyone
knelt
and
began
to
sing
a
prayer
all
this
performing
was
interrupted
several
times
by
the
rapturous
shouts
of
the
spectators
during
this
act
natasha
each
time
she
glanced
at
the
parterre
saw
anatole
kuragin
his
arm
flung
over
the
back
of
his
seat
looking
at
her
she
was
pleased
to
see
that
he
was
so
captivated
by
her
and
it
never
entered
her
head
that
there
was
anything
bad
in
it
when
the
second
act
was
over
countess
bezukhov
got
up
turned
to
the
rostovs
box
her
bosom
was
now
completely
bared
beckoned
to
the
old
count
with
her
gloved
finger
and
ignoring
the
people
who
came
into
her
box
began
talking
to
him
with
an
amiable
smile
do
introduce
me
to
your
lovely
daughters
she
said
the
whole
town
is
shouting
about
them
and
i
dont
know
them
natasha
stood
up
and
curtsied
to
the
magnificent
countess
natasha
was
so
pleased
to
be
praised
by
this
brilliant
beauty
that
she
blushed
with
pleasure
i
too
want
to
become
a
muscovite
now
said
h233l232ne
and
you
should
be
ashamed
to
bury
such
pearls
in
the
country
countess
bezukhov
was
entitled
to
her
reputation
as
an
enchanting
woman
she
was
able
to
say
what
she
did
not
think
and
especially
to
flatter
with
perfect
simplicity
and
naturalness
no
dear
count
you
must
allow
me
to
occupy
myself
with
your
daughters

for
long
but
then
neither

to
entertain
them
i
had
already
heard
much
about

in
petersburg
and
wanted
to
get
to

she
said
to
natasha
with
her
uniformly
beautiful
smile
i
had
heard
about
you
from
my
page
drubetskoyhave
you
heard
hes
getting
marriedand
from
my
husbands
friend
bolkonsky
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
she
said
with
special
emphasis
hinting
by
it
that
she
knew
of
his
relation
to
natasha
she
asked
that
in
order
to
become
better
acquainted
one
of
the
girls
be
allowed
to
sit
in
her
box
for
the
rest
of
the
performance
and
natasha
went
over
to
her
in
the
third
act
there
was
a
representation
of
a
palace
on
stage
in
which
many
candles
were
burning
and
paintings
were
hung
portraying
knights
with
little
beards
in
front
stood
probably
a
tsar
and
tsaritsa
the
tsar
waved
his
right
arm
and
evidently
timid
sang
something
poorly
then
sat
down
on
a
raspberrycolored
throne
the
girl
who
had
first
been
in
white
then
in
light
blue
was
now
dressed
in
nothing
but
a
shift
with
her
hair
down
and
stood
by
the
throne
she
sang
ruefully
about
something
addressing
the
tsaritsa
but
the
tsar
sternly
waved
his
arm
and
from
the
sides
came
men
with
bare
legs
and
women
with
bare
legs
and
they
began
dancing
all
together
then
the
violins
began
to
play
very
shrilly
and
merrily
one
of
the
girls
with
fat
bare
legs
and
skinny
arms
separated
from
the
others
went
into
the
wings
straightened
her
bodice
came
out
to
the
center
and
started
leaping
and
rapidly
slapping
one
foot
against
the
other
everyone
in
the
parterre
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
bravo
then
one
of
the
men
went
to
the
corner
in
the
orchestra
the
cymbals
and
trumpets
struck
up
more
loudly
and
this
one
man
with
bare
legs
started
leaping
high
in
the
air
and
shifting
his
feet
this
man
was
duport
who
earned
sixty
thousand
silver
roubles
for
this
art
everyone
in
the
parterre
in
the
boxes
and
in
the
gallery
started
clapping
and
shouting
with
all
their
might
and
the
man
stopped
and
started
smiling
and
bowing
on
all
sides
then
the
other
men
and
women
with
bare
legs
danced
then
one
of
the
tsars
again
shouted
something
to
the
music
and
they
all
began
to
sing
but
suddenly
a
storm
broke
the
orchestra
played
chromatic
scales
and
diminished
seventh
chords
and
everyone
ran
and
again
dragged
one
of
those
present
into
the
wings
and
the
curtain
fell
again
a
terrible
noise
and
clamor
arose
among
the
spectators
and
everyone
started
shouting
with
rapturous
faces
duport
duport
duport
natasha
no
longer
found
it
strange
she
looked
around
with
pleasure
smiling
joyfully
nestce

said
h233l232ne
turning
to
her
oh
oui
answered
natasha
x
during
the
entracte
there
was
a
gust
of
cold
in
h233l232nes
box
the
door
opened
and
anatole
came
in
ducking
his
head
and
trying
not
to
snag
on
anyone
allow
me
to
introduce
my
brother
to
you
said
h233l232ne
her
eyes
darting
uneasily
from
natasha
to
anatole
natasha
turned
her
pretty
head
and
smiled
at
the
handsome
fellow
over
her
bare
shoulder
anatole
who
was
as
goodlooking
close
up
as
from
afar
sat
down
next
to
her
and
said
that
he
had
long
wished
to
have
this
pleasure
ever
since
the
naryshkins
ball
where
he
had
had
the
pleasure
which
he
had
not
forgotten
of
seeing
her
with
women
kuragin
was
much
more
intelligent
and
simple
than
in
the
company
of
men
he
spoke
boldly
and
simply
and
natasha
was
strangely
and
pleasantly
struck
that
there
was
not
only
nothing
frightening
in
this
man
of
whom
there
was
so
much
talk
but
that
on
the
contrary
he
had
a
most
na239vely
cheerful
and
goodnatured
smile
anatole
kuragin
asked
what
her
impression
of
the
performance
was
and
told
her
that
during
the
previous
performance
semyonova
had
fallen
on
stage
but
you
know
countess
he
said
suddenly
addressing
her
like
an
old
longstanding
acquaintance
were
organizing
a
costume
carousel

take
it

great
fun

wont
you
he
said
while
saying
this
he
never
took
his
smiling
eyes
from
natashas
face
neck
and
bared
arms
natasha
knew
beyond
doubt
that
he
admired
her
she
enjoyed
that
but
for
some
reason
his
presence
made
her
feel
constrained
hot
and
oppressed
when
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
her
shoulders
and
she
involuntarily
intercepted
his
glance
preferring
that
he
look
into
her
eyes
but
looking
into
his
eyes
she
felt
with
fear
that
between
him
and
her
that
barrier
of
modesty
which
she
had
always
felt
between
herself
and
other
men
was
not
there
at
all
without
knowing
how
herself
after
five
minutes
she
felt
terribly
close
to
this
man
whenever
she
turned
away
she
was
afraid
he
might
take
her
bare
arm
from
behind
or
kiss
her
on
the
neck
they
talked
about
the
simplest
things
and
she
felt
that
they
were
closer
than
she
had
ever
been
with
any
man
natasha
glanced
at
h233l232ne
and
at
her
father
as
if
asking
them
what
on
earth
it
meant
but
h233l232ne
was
taken
up
by
a
conversation
with
some
general
and
did
not
respond
to
her
glance
and
her
fathers
glance
said
nothing
to
her
except
what
it
always
said
youre
enjoying
yourself
and
im
glad
in
one
of
the
moments
of
awkward
silence
during
which
anatole
calmly
and
persistently
stared
at
her
with
his
prominent
eyes
natasha
to
break
the
silence
asked
him
how
he
liked
moscow
natasha
asked
it
and
blushed
she
kept
feeling
that
she
was
doing
something
indecent
in
speaking
with
him
anatole
smiled
as
if
encouraging
her
in
the
beginning
i
didnt
like
it
much
because
what
is
it
that
makes
a
city
pleasant
ce
sont
les
jolies
femmes
isnt
that
so
well
but
now
i
like
it
very
much
he
said
looking
at
her
meaningfully
will
you
come
to
this
carousel
countess
please
do
come
he
said
and
reaching
his
hand
out
to
her
bouquet
and
lowering
his
voice
he
said
vous
serez
la
plus
jolie
venez
ch232re
comtesse
et
comme
gage
donnezmoi
cette
fleur
natasha
did
not
understand
what
he
said
nor
did
he
himself
but
she
felt
that
there
was
some
indecent
purpose
in
his
incomprehensible
words
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
she
turned
away
as
if
she
had
not
heard
what
he
said
but
as
soon
as
she
turned
away
she
thought
that
he
was
there
behind
her
so
near
to
her
how
is
he
now
is
he
embarrassed
angry
should
i
set
things
right
she
asked
herself
she
could
not
help
turning
to
look
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
his
nearness
and
his
confidence
and
the
goodnatured
tenderness
of
his
smile
won
her
over
she
also
smiled
at
him
just
as
he
did
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
and
again
she
felt
with
horror
that
between
him
and
her
there
was
no
barrier
of
any
sort
the
curtain
rose
again
anatole
left
the
box
calm
and
cheerful
natasha
returned
to
her
fathers
box
now
totally
subjected
to
the
world
she
was
in
everything
that
was
happening
before
her
now
seemed
perfectly
natural
to
her
but
instead
all
her
former
thoughts
about
her
fianc233
about
princess
marya
about
country
life
never
once
entered
her
head
as
if
it
was
all
long
ago
long
past
in
the
fourth
act
there
was
a
devil
who
sang
waving
his
arm
until
the
boards
were
pulled
out
from
under
him
and
he
sank
down
below
that
was
all
natasha
saw
of
the
fourth
act
something
excited
and
tormented
her
and
the
cause
of
it
was
kuragin
whom
she
involuntarily
followed
with
her
eyes
as
they
were
leaving
the
theater
anatole
came
up
to
them
hailed
their
carriage
and
helped
them
in
helping
natasha
in
he
pressed
her
arm
above
the
wrist
natasha
excited
red
and
happy
glanced
at
him
he
flashing
his
eyes
and
smiling
tenderly
was
looking
at
her
only
when
she
came
home
could
natasha
clearly
think
through
all
that
had
happened
to
her
and
suddenly
remembering
prince
andrei
she
became
horrified
and
in
front
of
everyone
over
the
tea
to
which
they
all
sat
down
after
the
theater
gasped
loudly
turned
red
and
ran
out
of
the
room
my
god
im
lost
she
said
to
herself
how
could
i
have
allowed
it
she
thought
for
a
long
time
she
sat
covering
her
flushed
face
with
her
hands
trying
to
give
herself
a
clear
accounting
of
what
had
happened
to
her
and
she
could
understand
neither
what
had
happened
nor
what
she
felt
everything
seemed
dark
unclear
and
frightening
to
her
there
in
that
huge
brightly
lit
hall
where
duport
with
bare
legs
and
a
sparkling
jacket
had
leaped
over
the
wet
boards
to
the
music
and
girls
and
old
men
and
the
bare
h233l232ne
with
her
calm
and
proud
smile
had
rapturously
shouted
bravothere
in
the
shadow
of
this
h233l232ne
everything
had
been
clear
and
simple
but
now
alone
with
herself
it
was
incomprehensible
what
on
earth
is
it
what
is
this
fear
that
i
feel
before
him
what
is
this
remorse
that
i
feel
now
she
wondered
only
to
the
old
countess
in
bed
at
night
would
natasha
have
been
able
to
tell
everything
she
thought
she
knew
that
sonya
with
her
strict
and
wholesome
view
would
either
understand
nothing
or
be
horrified
by
her
confession
natasha
alone
with
herself
tried
to
resolve
what
was
tormenting
her
am
i
lost
for
prince
andreis
love
or
not
she
asked
herself
and
with
a
placating
smile
she
answered
herself
what
a
fool
i
am
to
be
asking
that
what
happened
to
me
nothing
i
did
nothing
i
didnt
provoke
it
in
any
way
no
one
will
know
of
it
and
i
will
never
see
him
again
she
said
to
herself
so
its
clear
that
nothing
happened
that
theres
nothing
to
repent
of
that
prince
andrei
can
love
me
like
this
but
whats
this
like
this
ah
my
god
my
god
why
isnt
he
here
natasha
would
calm
down
for
a
moment
but
then
again
some
instinct
would
tell
her
that
although
it
was
all
true
and
nothing
had
happenedthe
instinct
would
tell
her
that
all
the
former
purity
of
her
love
for
prince
andrei
was
lost
and
again
in
her
imagination
she
would
repeat
her
whole
conversation
with
kuragin
and
picture
the
face
the
gesture
the
tender
smile
of
that
handsome
and
bold
man
when
he
pressed
her
arm
xi
anatole
kuragin
was
living
in
moscow
because
his
father
had
sent
him
away
from
petersburg
where
he
spent
over
twenty
thousand
a
year
in
cash
and
the
same
amount
in
debts
which
his
creditors
demanded
from
his
father
the
father
announced
to
the
son
that
he
would
pay
half
his
debts
for
the
last
time
but
only
on
condition
that
he
go
to
moscow
in
his
capacity
as
the
commander
in
chiefs
adjutant
which
he
had
solicited
for
him
and
try
finally
to
find
a
good
match
for
himself
there
he
pointed
out
princess
marya
and
julie
karagin
for
him
anatole
agreed
and
went
to
moscow
where
he
stayed
with
pierre
at
first
pierre
received
anatole
reluctantly
but
then
he
got
used
to
him
occasionally
went
carousing
with
him
and
gave
him
money
in
the
guise
of
loans
anatole
as
shinshin
rightly
said
of
him
had
driven
all
the
moscow
ladies
out
of
their
minds
ever
since
his
arrival
especially
by
neglecting
them
and
apparently
preferring
gypsy
women
and
french
actresses
with
the
foremost
of
whom
mlle
george
he
was
said
to
be
in
intimate
relations
he
never
missed
a
single
carouse
at
dolokhovs
and
at
other
moscow
merrymakers
drank
all
night
long
outdrank
everybody
and
attended
all
the
high
society
soir233es
and
balls
there
was
talk
of
several
intrigues
of
his
with
moscow
ladies
and
at
balls
he
paid
court
to
some
but
he
never
approached
young
girls
especially
rich
marriageable
ones
who
were
for
the
most
the
less
so
in
that
anatolesomething
no
one
but
his
closest
friends
knewhad
gotten
married
two
years
before
two
years
before
while
his
regiment
was
stationed
in
poland
a
modest
polish
landowner
had
forced
anatole
to
marry
his
daughter
anatole
quite
soon
abandoned
his
wife
and
for
the
money
he
promised
to
send
to
his
fatherinlaw
reserved
for
himself
the
right
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
bachelor
anatole
was
always
content
with
his
position
with
himself
and
with
others
he
was
instinctively
convinced
with
his
whole
being
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
live
otherwise
than
the
way
he
lived
and
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
done
anything
bad
he
was
not
capable
of
reflecting
either
on
how
his
actions
might
affect
others
or
on
what
might
come
of
one
or
another
of
his
actions
he
was
convinced
that
just
as
the
duck
was
created
so
that
it
must
always
live
in
water
so
he
was
created
by
god
so
that
he
must
live
on
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
and
occupy
a
high
position
in
society
he
believed
it
so
firmly
that
others
looking
at
him
were
also
convinced
of
it
and
refused
him
neither
a
high
position
in
society
nor
the
money
which
he
obviously
without
paying
it
back
borrowed
from
anyone
and
everyone
he
was
not
a
gambler
at
least
he
never
cared
about
winning
and
never
even
regretted
losing
he
was
not
vain
to
him
it
made
absolutely
no
difference
what
people
thought
of
him
still
less
could
he
be
accused
of
being
ambitious
several
times
he
taunted
his
father
by
ruining
his
career
and
he
made
fun
of
all
honors
he
was
not
stingy
and
never
refused
anyone
who
asked
of
him
there
was
one
thing
he
lovedmerrymaking
and
womenand
since
to
his
mind
there
was
nothing
ignoble
in
these
tastes
and
since
he
was
unable
to
reflect
on
the
consequences
that
the
satisfaction
of
his
tastes
had
for
other
people
at
heart
he
considered
himself
an
irreproachable
man
sincerely
despised
scoundrels
and
bad
people
and
with
an
easy
conscience
carried
his
head
high
carousers
those
male
magdalenes
have
a
hidden
sense
of
awareness
of
their
innocence
just
as
female
magdalenes
have
based
on
the
same
hope
of
forgiveness
everything
will
be
forgiven
her
for
she
loved
much
and
everything
will
be
forgiven
him
for
he
had
much
fun
dolokhov
who
had
appeared
again
in
moscow
that
year
after
his
banishment
and
his
persian
adventures
and
who
was
leading
a
magnificent
gambling
and
carousing
life
became
close
with
his
old
petersburg
friend
kuragin
and
used
him
for
his
own
purposes
anatole
sincerely
liked
dolokhov
for
his
intelligence
and
daring
dolokhov
who
needed
the
name
noble
birth
and
connections
of
anatole
kuragin
to
lure
rich
young
men
into
his
gambling
company
used
and
toyed
with
kuragin
without
letting
him
feel
it
a
the
calculation
which
made
anatole
necessary
for
him
the
very
process
of
manipulating
another
persons
will
was
a
pleasure
a
habit
and
a
necessity
for
dolokhov
natasha
had
made
a
strong
impression
on
kuragin
over
supper
after
the
theater
in
the
manner
of
a
connoisseur
he
analyzed
for
dolokhov
the
merits
of
her
arms
shoulders
feet
and
hair
and
announced
his
decision
to
dangle
after
her
a
bit
what
the
result
of
this
courtship
might
be
anatole
could
not
reflect
upon
or
know
as
he
never
knew
what
the
result
of
any
of
his
actions
would
be
shes
a
nice
one
brother
but
not
for
us
dolokhov
said
to
him
ill
tell
my
sister
to
invite
her
to
dinner
said
anatole
eh
youd
better
wait
till
shes
married
you

jadore
les

shell
get
all
flustered
you
already
got
caught
once
over
a

said
dolokhov
who
knew
about
anatoles
marriage
watch
out
well
as
if
it
cant
happen

eh
said
anatole
laughing
goodnaturedly
xii
the
day
after
the
theater
the
rostovs
did
not
go
anywhere
and
no
one
came
to
them
marya
dmitrievna
discussed
something
with
natashas
father
concealing
it
from
her
natasha
could
guess
that
they
were
talking
about
the
old
prince
working
something
out
and
that
disturbed
and
offended
her
she
was
expecting
prince
andrei
any
moment
and
had
sent
the
yard
porter
to
vzdvizhenka
twice
that
day
to
find
out
if
he
had
come
he
had
not
it
was
now
harder
for
her
than
in
the
first
days
after
her
arrival
to
her
impatience
and
sadness
were
added
the
unpleasant
memory
of
meeting
princess
marya
and
the
old
prince
and
a
fear
and
uneasiness
of
which
she
did
not
know
the
cause
she
kept
fancying
either
that
he
would
never
come
or
that
something
would
happen
to
her
before
he
came
she
could
not
as
before
think
about
him
calmly
and
for
a
long
time
alone
with
herself
as
soon
as
she
began
thinking
about
him
to
her
memory
of
him
were
added
the
memories
of
the
old
prince
of
princess
marya
of
last
nights
performance
and
of
kuragin
she
again
faced
the
question
of
whether
she
was
to
blame
whether
she
had
already
broken
faith
with
prince
andrei
and
she
again
found
herself
recalling
in
the
minutest
detail
every
word
every
gesture
every
shade
of
expression
that
had
played
on
the
face
of
this
man
who
was
able
to
arouse
in
her
an
incomprehensible
and
frightening
feeling
in
the
eyes
of
those
around
her
natasha
seemed
more
animated
than
usual
but
she
was
far
from
being
as
calm
and
happy
as
she
had
been
before
on
sunday
morning
marya
dmitrievna
invited
her
guests
to
the
liturgy
at
her
parish
of
the
dormition
on
mogiltsy
i
dont
like
these
fashionable
churches
she
said
obviously
proud
of
her
freedom
of
thought
god
is
the
same
everywhere
we
have
a
wonderful
priest
he
celebrates
properly
with
some
nobility
and
so
does
the
deacon
is
it
some
sort
of
holiness
if
the
choir
sings
a
concert
i
dont
like
it
its
nothing
but
indulgence
marya
dmitrievna
liked
sundays
and
knew
how
to
make
them
festive
her
house
was
always
all
scrubbed
and
cleaned
on
saturday
she
and
her
servants
did
no
work
everybody
got
dressed
up
festively
and
everybody
went
to
the
liturgy
courses
were
added
to
the
mistresss
dinner
and
the
servants
were
given
vodka
and
a
roast
goose
or
suckling
pig
but
in
nothing
in
the
whole
house
was
the
festivity
so
noticeable
as
in
marya
dmitrievnas
broad
stern
face
which
on
that
day
acquired
a
permanent
expression
of
solemnity
when
they
had
finished
coffee
after
the
liturgy
in
the
drawing
room
where
the
dustcovers
had
been
removed
it
was
announced
to
marya
dmitrievna
that
the
carriage
was
ready
and
she
with
a
stern
look
dressed
in
the
fancy
shawl
in
which
she
went
visiting
stood
up
and
declared
that
she
was
going
to
see
prince
nikolai
andreevich
bolkonsky
to
have
a
talk
with
him
concerning
natasha
after
marya
dmitrievnas
departure
a
dressmaker
came
to
the
rostovs
from
madame
chalmet
and
natasha
shutting
the
door
to
the
room
next
to
the
drawing
room
very
pleased
to
be
diverted
began
trying
on
the
new
dresses
as
she
was
putting
on
a
tacked
together
and
still
sleeveless
bodice
turning
her
head
to
see
in
the
mirror
how
the
back
fitted
she
heard
animated
voices
from
the
drawing
room
one
her
fathers
and
the
other
a
womans
voice
which
made
her
blush
it
was
the
voice
of
h233l232ne
before
natasha
had
time
to
take
off
the
bodice
she
was
trying
on
the
door
opened
and
countess
bezukhov
walked
in
beaming
with
a
goodnatured
and
affectionate
smile
in
a
dark
purple
velvet
dress
with
a
high
collar
ah
ma
d233licieuse
she
said
to
the
blushing
natasha
charmante
no
this
will
never
do
my
dear
count
she
said
to
ilya
andreich
who
came

after
eight
she
nodded
to
the
dressmaker
whom
she
knew
and
who
curtsied
to
her
deferentially
and
sat
down
in
an
armchair
near
the
mirror
picturesquely
spreading
the
folds
of
her
velvet
dress
she
kept
babbling
away
gaily
and
goodnaturedly
ceaselessly
admiring
natashas
beauty
she
examined
her
dresses
and
praised
them
boasted
of
her
own
new
dress
en
gaze
metallique
which
she
had
received
from
paris
and
advised
natasha
to
order
one
like
it
though
everything
becomes
you
my
lovely
one
she
said
the
smile
of
pleasure
never
left
natashas
face
she
felt
herself
happy
and
blossoming
under
the
praises
of
this
nice
countess
bezukhov
who
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
such
an
unapproachable
and
important
lady
and
who
was
now
so
kind
to
her
natasha
became
cheerful
and
she
felt
almost
in
love
with
this
woman
who
was
so
beautiful
and
so
goodnatured
h233l232ne
for
her
part
sincerely
admired
natasha
and
wished
to
entertain
her
anatole
had
asked
her
to
bring
him
and
natasha
together
and
she
had
come
to
the
rostovs
for
that
the
thought
of
bringing
her
brother
together
with
natasha
amused
her
despite
the
fact
that
she
had
formerly
been
vexed
with
natasha
in
petersburg
for
having
won
boris
away
from
her
she
did
not
think
of
that
now
and
in
her
own
way
wholeheartedly
wished
natasha
well
as
she
was
leaving
the
rostovs
she
called
her
prot233g233e

so
she
and
her

pierre
the
upright
pierre
thought
natasha
have
talked
and
laughed
about
it
so
its
nothing
at
all
and
again
under
h233l232nes
influence
that
which
formerly
had
appeared
to
be
frightening
now
seemed
simple
and
natural
and
shes
such
a
grande
dame
such
a
sweet
lady
and
she
clearly
loves
me
with
all
her
heart
thought
natasha
and
why
shouldnt
i
have
fun
she
thought
looking
at
h233l232ne
with
astonished
wideopen
eyes
marya
dmitrievna
came
home
for
dinner
silent
grave
obviously
having
suffered
a
defeat
at
the
old
princes
she
was
still
too
agitated
after
the
confrontation
that
had
occurred
to
be
able
to
tell
about
it
calmly
to
the
counts
question
she
replied
that
all
was
well
and
that
she
would
tell
him
about
it
tomorrow
learning
of
countess
bezukhovs
visit
and
the
invitation
for
the
evening
marya
dmitrievna
said
i
dont
like
to
keep
company
with
the
bezukhov
woman
and
i
dont
advise
it
but
if
youve
already
promised
go
divert
yourself
she
added
addressing
natasha
xiii
count
ilya
andreich
took
his
girls
to
countess
bezukhovs
there
were
quite
a
few
people
at
the
soir233e
but
the
company
was
almost
entirely
unfamiliar
to
natasha
count
ilya
andreich
noticed
with
displeasure
that
this
company
consisted
mostly
of
men
and
of
ladies
known
for
the
frivolity
of
their
behavior
mlle
george
surrounded
by
young
men
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
drawing
room
there
were
several
frenchmen
among
them
m233tivier
who
since
h233l232nes
arrival
had
become
a
familiar
of
her
house
count
ilya
andreich
decided
not
to
sit
down
to
cards
not
to
go
far
from
his
daughters
and
to
leave
as
soon
as
the
actresss
performance
was
over
anatole
was
obviously
waiting
by
the
door
for
the
rostovs
to
come
in
having
greeted
the
count
he
at
once
went
up
to
natasha
and
followed
her
as
soon
as
natasha
saw
him
she
was
seized
by
the
same
feeling
as
in
the
theater
of
vain
pleasure
at
being
liked
by
him
and
of
fear
because
of
the
absence
of
moral
barriers
between
them
h233l232ne
joyfully
welcomed
natasha
and
loudly
admired
her
beauty
and
her
attire
soon
after
their
arrival
mlle
george
left
the
room
to
get
dressed
in
the
drawing
room
they
began
arranging
chairs
and
sitting
down
anatole
moved
a
chair
for
natasha
and
was
about
to
sit
next
to
her
but
the
count
who
never
took
his
eyes
off
natasha
sat
next
to
her
anatole
sat
behind
them
mlle
george
with
bared
fat
dimpled
arms
wearing
a
red
shawl
over
one
shoulder
came
out
into
the
empty
space
left
for
her
among
the
chairs
and
stopped
in
an
unnatural
pose
rapturous
whispering
was
heard
mlle
george
gave
the
public
a
stern
and
gloomy
look
and
began
to
recite
some
verses
in
french
in
which
the
talk
was
of
her
criminal
love
for
her
son
in
places
she
raised
her
voice
in
places
she
whispered
solemnly
lifting
up
her
head
in
places
she
paused
and
gasped
rolling
her
eyes
adorable
divin
d233licieux
came
from
all
sides
natasha
looked
at
the
fat
george
but
heard
nothing
saw
and
understood
nothing
of
what
went
on
before
her
she
only
felt
herself
again
quite
irretrievably
in
that
strange
insane
world
so
far
from
her
former
one
that
world
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
was
good
what
was
bad
what
was
sane
and
what
insane
behind
her
sat
anatole
and
she
sensing
his
nearness
waited
fearfully
for
something
after
the
first
monologue
the
whole
company
stood
up
and
surrounded
mlle
george
expressing
their
rapture
how
beautiful
she
is
natasha
said
to
her
father
who
stood
up
along
with
the
others
and
moved
through
the
crowd
towards
the
actress
i
dont
find
her
so
looking
at
you
said
anatole
following
natasha
he
said
it
at
a
moment
when
she
alone
could
hear
him
youre
lovelyfrom
the
moment
i
first
saw
you
ive
never
ceased
come
along
come
along
natasha
said
the
count
turning
back
for
his
daughter
how
beautiful
she
is
natasha
saying
nothing
went
up
to
her
father
and
looked
at
him
with
questioningly
astonished
eyes
after
several
recitations
mlle
george
left
and
countess
bezukhov
invited
the
company
to
the
reception
room
the
count
wanted
to
leave
but
h233l232ne
begged
him
not
to
ruin
her
improvised
ball
the
rostovs
stayed
anatole
invited
natasha
for
a
waltz
and
during
the
waltz
he
pressed
her
waist
and
her
hand
told
her
that
she
was
ravissante
and
that
he
loved
her
during
the
233cossaise
which
she
again
danced
with
kuragin
when
they
were
left
alone
anatole
said
nothing
and
only
looked
at
her
natasha
had
doubts
whether
what
he
had
said
to
her
during
the
waltz
was
not
a
dream
at
the
end
of
the
first
figure
he
again
pressed
her
hand
natasha
raised
her
frightened
eyes
to
him
but
there
was
such
a
selfassured
tender
expression
in
his
affectionate
gaze
and
smile
that
looking
at
him
she
could
not
tell
him
what
she
had
to
tell
him
she
lowered
her
eyes
dont
say
such
things
to
me
i
am
betrothed
and
love
another
man
she
said
quicklyshe
glanced
at
him
anatole
was
not
embarrassed
or
upset
by
what
she
told
him
dont
talk
to
me
about
that
what
do
i
care
he
said
i
say
that
im
madly
madly
in
love
with
you
is
it
my
fault
that
youre
exquisiteits
our
turn
natasha
animated
and
alarmed
looked
around
with
wideopen
frightened
eyes
and
seemed
merrier
than
usual
she
remembered
almost
nothing
of
what
happened
that
evening
they
danced
the
233cossaise
and
the
grossvater
her
father
invited
her
to
leave
she
begged
to
stay
wherever
she
was
whomever
she
talked
with
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
then
she
remembered
that
she
asked
her
fathers
permission
to
go
to
the
dressing
room
and
straighten
her
dress
that
h233l232ne
came
after
her
spoke
to
her
laughingly
of
her
brothers
love
and
that
in
a
small
sitting
room
she
again
met
anatole
that
h233l232ne
disappeared
somewhere
the
two
of
them
were
left
alone
and
anatole
taking
her
hand
said
in
a
tender
voice
i
cannot
call
on
you
but
can
it
be
that
i
will
never
see
you
i
love
you
madly
can
it
be
never
and
blocking
her
way
he
brought
his
face
close
to
hers
his
shining
big
masculine
eyes
were
so
close
to
her
eyes
that
she
saw
nothing
except
those
eyes
natalie
his
voice
whispered
questioningly
and
someone
squeezed
her
hands
painfully
natalie
i
understand
nothing
i
have
nothing
to
say
her
gaze
said
hot
lips
pressed
themselves
to
her
lips
and
at
the
same
moment
she
felt
herself
released
again
and
heard
the
rustle
of
h233l232nes
dress
in
the
room
and
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
natasha
glanced
at
h233l232ne
then
red
and
trembling
gave
him
a
fearfully
questioning
glance
and
went
to
the
door
un
mot
un
seul
au
nom
de
dieu
anatole
was
saying
she
stopped
she
needed
so
much
that
he
say
that
word
which
would
explain
to
her
what
had
happened
and
that
she
could
answer
him
natalie
un
mot
un
seul
he
kept
repeating
apparently
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
he
repeated
it
until
h233l232ne
came
up
to
them
h233l232ne
came
out
to
the
drawing
room
again
together
with
natasha
without
staying
for
supper
the
rostovs
left
having
returned
home
natasha
did
not
sleep
all
night
an
insoluble
question
tormented
her
whom
did
she
love
anatole
or
prince
andrei
she
did
love
prince
andreishe
clearly
remembered
how
strongly
she
loved
him
but
she
also
loved
anatole
that
was
beyond
doubt
otherwise
how
could
all
this
have
happened
she
wondered
if
after
that
in
saying
goodbye
to
him
i
could
respond
to
his
smile
with
a
smile
if
i
could
let
it
go
that
far
it
means
that
i
loved
him
from
the
first
moment
it
means
that
he
is
kind
noble
and
beautiful
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
love
him
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
him
and
love
the
other
she
said
to
herself
finding
no
answers
to
these
terrible
questions
xiv
morning
came
with
its
cares
and
bustle
everybody
got
up
began
to
move
to
talk
again
the
dressmakers
came
again
marya
dmitrievna
came
out
and
tea
was
served
natasha
looked
at
them
all
uneasily
with
wideopen
eyes
as
if
she
wanted
to
catch
every
glance
directed
at
her
and
tried
to
seem
the
same
as
she
always
was
after
breakfast
marya
dmitrievna
this
was
her
best
time
sat
down
in
her
armchair
and
called
natasha
and
the
old
count
to
her
well
my
friends
ive
thought
the
whole
matter
over
and
heres
my
advice
to
you
she
began
yesterday
as
you
know
i
called
on
prince
nikolai
well
sir
and
i
talked
with
himhe
took
a
notion
to
shout
but
theres
no
outshouting
me
i
sang
it
all
out
for
him
and
what
about
him
asked
the
count
what
about
him
a
madcapdoesnt
want
to
listen
well
theres
no
point
talking
weve
worn
the
poor
girl
out
as
it
is
said
marya
dmitrievna
and
my
advice
to
you
is
to
finish
your
business
and
go
home
to
otradnoeand
wait
there
ah
no
cried
natasha
no
go
home
said
marya
dmitrievna
and
wait
there
if
her
fianc233
comes
here
now
therell
be
no
avoiding
a
quarrel
and
here
he
can
talk
it
over
alone
with
the
old
man
and
then
come
to
you
ilya
andreich
approved
of
this
suggestion
grasping
its
good
sense
at
once
if
the
old
man
softens
it
will
be
all
the
better
if
they
come
to
him
in
moscow
or
bald
hills
afterwards
if
not
then
they
could
marry
against
his
will
only
in
otradnoe
thats
the
veritable
truth
he
said
and
i
regret
that
i
went
to
see
him
and
took
her
said
the
old
count
no
what
is
there
to
regret
being
here
you
couldnt
help
paying
your
respects
and
if
he
doesnt
want
it
thats
his
business
said
marya
dmitrievna
looking
for
something
in
her
reticule
and
the
trousseau
is
ready
you
have
nothing
else
to
wait
for
and
what
isnt
ready
ill
send
to
you
though
ill
miss
you
its
better
that
you
go
with
god
having
found
what
she
was
looking
for
in
the
reticule
she
gave
it
to
natasha
it
was
a
letter
from
princess
marya
she
writes
to
you
shes
suffering
so
the
poor
thing
shes
afraid
youll
think
she
doesnt
love
you
but
she
doesnt
love
me
said
natasha
dont
talk
nonsense
cried
marya
dmitrievna
i
wont
believe
anyone
i
know
she
doesnt
love
me
natasha
said
boldly
taking
the
letter
and
her
face
showed
a
dry
and
spiteful
resolution
that
made
marya
dmitrievna
look
at
her
more
intently
and
frown
dont
you
answer
me
back
like
that
dearie
she
said
what
im
saying
is
true
write
a
reply
natasha
did
not
answer
and
went
to
her
room
to
read
princess
maryas
letter
princess
marya
wrote
that
she
was
in
despair
because
of
the
misunderstanding
that
had
occurred
between
them
whatever
her
fathers
feelings
were
wrote
princess
marya
she
asked
natasha
to
believe
that
she
could
not
but
love
her
as
the
one
chosen
by
her
brother
for
whose
happiness
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
however
she
wrote
do
not
think
that
my
father
is
illdisposed
towards
you
he
is
an
old
and
ailing
man
who
ought
to
be
excused
but
he
is
kind
magnanimous
and
will
love
the
one
who
will
make
for
his
sons
happiness
princess
marya
also
asked
natasha
to
set
a
time
when
she
could
see
her
again
having
read
the
letter
natasha
sat
down
at
the
desk
to
write
a
reply
ch232re
princesse
she
wrote
quickly
and
mechanically
and
stopped
what
could
she
write
after
all
that
had
happened
yesterday
yes
yes
all
that
was
and
now
its
all
different
she
thought
sitting
over
the
started
letter
must
i
refuse
him
must
i
really
its
terrible
and
so
as
not
to
think
those
dreadful
thoughts
she
went
to
sonya
and
began
sorting
out
patterns
with
her
after
dinner
natasha
went
to
her
room
and
again
took
up
princess
maryas
letter
can
it
all
be
over
already
she
wondered
can
it
all
have
happened
so
quickly
and
have
destroyed
all
the
former
things
she
recalled
her
love
for
prince
andrei
with
all
its
former
force
and
at
the
same
time
she
felt
that
she
loved
kuragin
she
vividly
imagined
herself
as
prince
andreis
wife
imagined
the
picture
of
her
happiness
with
him
repeated
in
her
mind
so
many
times
and
together
with
that
burning
with
excitement
she
pictured
to
herself
all
the
details
of
yesterdays
meeting
with
anatole
why
cant
it
be
both
together
she
thought
in
moments
of
total
darkening
only
then
would
i
be
perfectly
happy
but
now
i
must
make
a
choice
and
i
cant
be
happy
without
either
of
them
the
thing
is
she
thought
that
its
equally
impossible
to
tell
prince
andrei
what
has
happened
or
to
conceal
it
while
with
this
one
nothings
spoiled
but
can
i
really
with
the
happiness
of
loving
prince
andrei
which
ive
lived
with
for
so
long
miss
a
maid
said
in
a
whisper
with
a
mysterious
look
coming
into
the
room
a
man
told
me
to
give
you
this
the
maid
handed
her
a
letter
only
for
christs
sake
miss
the
maid
was
still
talking
while
natasha
unthinkingly
with
a
mechanical
movement
broke
the
seal
and
began
reading
anatoles
love
letter
from
which
not
understanding
a
word
of
it
she
understood
only
one
thing
that
this
letter
was
from
him
from
the
man
she
loved
yes
she
loves
him
otherwise
how
could
what
happened
have
happened
how
could
a
love
letter
from
him
be
in
her
hand
with
trembling
hands
natasha
held
this
passionate
love
letter
composed
for
anatole
by
dolokhov
and
reading
it
she
found
in
it
echoes
of
everything
she
thought
she
felt
herself
since
last
evening
my
fate
is
sealed
to
be
loved
by
you
or
to
die
i
have
no
other
way
out
the
letter
began
then
he
wrote
that
he
knew
the
family
would
not
give
her
to
him
that
there
were
secret
reasons
for
that
which
he
could
reveal
only
to
her
but
that
if
she
loved
him
she
had
only
to
say
the
word
yes
and
no
human
powers
would
prevent
their
bliss
love
would
overcome
all
he
would
abduct
her
and
carry
her
off
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
yes
yes
i
love
him
thought
natasha
rereading
the
letter
for
the
twentieth
time
and
seeking
some
special
deep
meaning
in
each
word
that
evening
marya
dmitrievna
went
to
the
arkharovs
and
suggested
that
the
girls
come
with
her
natasha
stayed
home
under
the
pretext
of
a
headache
xv
returning
late
in
the
evening
sonya
came
into
natashas
room
and
to
her
surprise
found
her
still
dressed
asleep
on
the
sofa
on
the
table
next
to
her
lay
the
opened
letter
from
anatole
sonya
picked
up
the
letter
and
started
reading
it
she
was
reading
and
glancing
at
the
sleeping
natasha
searching
her
face
for
an
explanation
of
what
she
was
reading
and
unable
to
find
it
the
face
was
gentle
meek
and
happy
clutching
her
chest
to
keep
from
choking
sonya
pale
and
termbling
with
fear
and
agitation
sat
in
an
armchair
and
dissolved
in
tears
how
is
it
i
didnt
see
anything
how
could
it
have
gone
so
far
can
it
be
she
no
longer
loves
prince
andrei
and
how
could
she
have
allowed
this
kuragin
hes
a
deceiver
and
a
villain
thats
clear
what
will
nicolas
dear
noble
nicolas
do
when
he
finds
out
about
it
so
this
is
what
her
excited
determined
and
unnatural
face
meant
two
days
ago
and
yesterday
and
today
thought
sonya
but
it
cant
be
that
she
loves
him
she
probably
opened
the
letter
not
knowing
whom
it
was
from
shes
probably
offended
she
cant
do
that
sonya
wiped
her
tears
and
went
over
to
natasha
again
peering
into
her
face
natasha
she
said
barely
audibly
natasha
woke
up
and
saw
sonya
ah
youre
back
and
with
the
resolution
and
tenderness
that
occur
in
moments
of
awakening
she
embraced
her
friend
but
noticing
the
embarrassment
on
sonyas
face
natashas
face
expressed
embarrassment
and
suspicion
sonya
you
read
the
letter
she
asked
yes
sonya
said
softly
natasha
smiled
rapturously
no
sonya

natasha

sonya

at
natasha
and
bolkonsky
she
asked

how

said
natasha
you
dont
know
what

but
natasha

that
be
all
over
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
big
open
eyes
as
if
she
did
not
understand
her
question
what
are
you
refusing
prince
andrei
asked
sonya

sonya
repeated

it
that

loved

natasha
i

natasha

natasha
embraced
and

but
only
now
have
i
experienced
this
love
this
isnt

as
soon
as
i
saw
him
i
felt
that
he
was
my
master
and
i

that
i
couldnt
help
loving
him
yes

sonya
natasha
said
with
a
happy
and
frightened
face
but
think
what
youre
doing
said
sonya
i
cant
leave
it
like
this
these
secret
lettershow

you
let
him
go
so
far
she
said
with
a
horror
and
revulsion
she
had
difficulty
hiding
i
told
you
replied
natasha
that
i
have
no
will
how
can
you
not
understand
that
i
love
him
then
i
wont
let
it
go
so

cried
sonya
bursting
into
tears
for
gods
sake
what
are
youif
you
tell
youre
my
enemy
natasha
began
you
want
me
to
be
unhappy
you
want
them
to
separate
us
seeing
this
fear
of
natashas
sonya
wept
tears
of
shame
and
pity
for
her
friend
but
what
has
happened
between
you
she
asked
what
has
he
told
you
why
cant
he
visit
our
house
natasha
did
not
answer
her
question
for
gods
sake
sonya
dont
tell
anyone
dont
torment
me
natasha
pleaded
remember
its
wrong
to
interfere
in
such
things
i
revealed
it
to
you
but
why
these
secrets
why
doesnt
he
come
to
the
house
sonya
kept
asking
why
doesnt
he
seek
your
hand
directly
prince
andrei
gave
you
full
freedom
if
thats
how
it
is
but
i
dont
believe
it
natasha
have
you
thought
what
secret
reasons
there
might
be
natasha
looked
at
sonya
with
astonished
eyes
clearly
this
question
had
presented
itself
to
her
for
the
first
time
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
answer
it
what
reasons
i
dont
know
but
it
means
there
are
reasons
sonya
sighed
and
shook
her
head
mistrustfully
if
there
are
reasons
she
began
but
natasha
guessing
her
doubts
interrupted
her
fearfully
sonya
its
impossible
to
doubt
him
impossible
impossible
do
you
understand
she
cried
does
he
love
you
love
natasha
repeated
with
a
smile
of
regret
at
her
friends
incomprehension
havent
you
read
the
letter
havent
you
seen
him
but
if
hes
an
ignoble
man
hean
ignoble
man
if
you
only
knew
said
natasha
if
hes
a
noble
man
then
he
should
either
declare
his
intentions
or
stop
seeing
you
and
if
you
dont
want
to
do
it
ill
do
it
ill
write
to
him
and
tell
papa
sonya
said
resolutely
but
i
cant
live
without
him
cried
natasha
natasha
i
dont
understand
you
what
are
you
saying
think
of
your
father
of
nicolas
i
dont
need
anybody
i
dont
love
anybody
but
him
how
dare
you
say
hes
ignoble
dont
you
know
that

him
cried
natasha
go
away
sonya
i
dont
want
to
quarrel
with
you
go
away
for
gods
sake
go
away
you
see
how
tormented
i
am
natasha
cried
angrily
in
a
restrainedly
irritated
and
desperate
voice
sonya
burst
into
sobs
and
ran
out
of
the
room
natasha
went
to
the
table
and
without
a
moments
thought
wrote
that
reply
to
princess
marya
which
she
had
been
unable
to
write
all
morning
in
this
letter
she
curtly
wrote
to
princess
marya
that
all
their
misunderstandings
were
over
that
taking
advantage
of
the
magnanimity
of
prince
andrei
who
on
leaving
had
given
her
freedom
she
asked
her
to
forget
everything
and
to
forgive
her
if
she
was
to
blame
before
her
but
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
all
this
seemed
so
easy
simple
and
clear
to
her
at
that
moment
on
friday
the
rostovs
were
to
go
to
the
country
and
on
wednesday
the
count
went
with
a
buyer
to
his
estate
near
moscow
on
the
day
of
the
counts
departure
sonya
and
natasha
were
invited
to
a
big
dinner
at
the
kuragins
and
marya
dmitrievna
brought
them
at
this
dinner
natasha
again
met
with
anatole
and
sonya
noticed
that
natasha
discussed
something
with
him
trying
not
to
be
heard
and
all
through
dinner
was
still
more
agitated
than
before
when
they
returned
home
natasha
was
the
first
to
begin
that
talk
with
sonya
which
her
friend
was
expecting
so
sonya
here
you
were
saying
all
kinds
of
stupid
things
about
him
natasha
began
in
a
meek
voice
the
sort
of
voice
in
which
children
speak
when
they
want
to
be
praised
he
and
i
had
a
talk
tonight
well
and
what
what
then
what
did
he
say
natasha
im
so
glad
youre
not
angry
with
me
tell
me
everything
the
whole
truth
what
did
he
say
natasha
became
thoughtful
ah
sonya
if
you
knew
him
as
i
do
he
saidhe
asked
me
what
sort
of
promise
i
had
made
to
bolkonsky
he
was
glad
that
it
rested
with
me
to
refuse
him
sonya
sighed
sadly
but
surely
you
havent
refused
bolkonsky
she
asked
maybe
i
even
have
refused
him
maybe
its
all
over
with
bolkonsky
why
do
you
think
so
ill
of
me
i
dont
think
anything
i
just
dont
understand
it
wait
sonya
youll
understand
everything
youll
see
what
a
man
he
is
only
dont
think
ill
either
of
me
or
of
him
i
dont
think
ill
of
anybody
i
love
everybody
and
pity
everybody
but
what
am
i
to
do
sonya
would
not
yield
to
the
tender
tone
in
which
natasha
addressed
her
the
more
soft
and
ingratiating
the
expression
of
natashas
face
was
the
more
serious
and
stern
was
the
face
of
sonya
natasha
she
said
you
asked
me
not
to
speak
to
you
and
i
didnt
you
yourself
began
it
now
natasha
i
dont
trust
him
why
this
secrecy
again
again
interrupted
natasha
natasha
im
afraid
for
you
why
be
afraid
im
afraid
youll
ruin
yourself
sonya
said
resolutely
frightened
herself
at
what
she
said
natashas
face
again
showed
anger
and
i
will
i
will
ill
ruin
myself
as
soon
as
possible
its
none
of
your
business
it
will
be
bad
for
me
not
for
you
leave
me

me
alone
i
hate
you
natasha
sonya
implored
her
fearfully
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
youre
my
enemy
forever
natasha
ran
out
of
the
room
natasha
did
not
speak
with
sonya
anymore
and
avoided
her
with
the
same
expression
of
agitated
surprise
and
criminality
she
paced
the
rooms
taking
up
one
thing
then
another
and
abandoning
them
at
once
hard
as
it
was
for
sonya
she
watched
her
friend
without
taking
her
eyes
off
her
the
day
before
the
count
was
to
come
back
sonya
noticed
that
natasha
sat
all
morning
by
the
window
in
the
drawing
room
as
if
waiting
for
something
and
that
she
made
a
sign
to
a
passing
officer
whom
sonya
took
to
be
anatole
sonya
began
to
watch
her
friend
still
more
attentively
and
noticed
that
all
through
dinner
and
in
the
evening
natasha
was
in
a
strange
and
unnatural
state
responded
beside
the
point
to
questions
put
to
her
began
phrases
and
did
not
finish
them
laughed
at
everything
after
tea
sonya
saw
a
timorous
maid
waiting
for
her
by
natashas
door
she
let
her
in
and
eavesdropping
at
the
door
learned
that
a
letter
had
been
brought
again
and
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
sonya
that
natasha
had
some
terrible
plan
for
that
night
sonya
knocked
on
her
door
natasha
did
not
let
her
in
shes
going
to
elope
with
him
thought
sonya
shes
capable
of
anything
tonight
there
was
something
especially
pathetic
and
resolute
in
her
face
she
cried
as
she
said
goodbye
to
uncle
sonya
recalled
yes
its
certain
shes
going
to
elope
with
himbut
what
am
i
to
do
sonya
wondered
recalling
the
signs
which
clearly
proved
to
her
that
natasha
had
some
terrible
intention
the
count
isnt
here
what
am
i
to
do
write
to
kuragin
demanding
an
explanation
from
him
but
who
will
tell
him
to
reply
to
me
write
to
pierre
as
prince
andrei
asked
me
to
do
in
case
of
misfortunebut
maybe
she
has
indeed
already
refused
bolkonsky
she
sent
a
letter
to
princess
marya
yesterday
uncles
not
here
to
tell
marya
dmitrievna
who
had
such
faith
in
natasha
seemed
terrible
to
sonya
but
one
way
or
another
thought
sonya
standing
in
the
dark
corridor
now
or
never
the
time
has
come
to
prove
that
i
remember
the
familys
kindness
to
me
and
that
i
love
nicolas
no
even
if
i
dont
sleep
for
three
nights
i
wont
leave
this
corridor
and
ill
keep
her
back
by
force
and
not
let
shame
fall
upon
their
family
she
thought
xvi
anatole
had
recently
moved
in
with
dolokhov
the
plan
for
abducting
miss
rostov
had
been
thought
out
and
prepared
by
dolokhov
several
days
ago
and
on
the
day
when
sonya
listening
at
natashas
door
decided
to
keep
watch
on
her
that
plan
was
to
be
put
into
execution
natasha
had
promised
to
come
out
to
kuragin
on
the
back
porch
at
ten
oclock
in
the
evening
kuragin
was
to
put
her
into
a
waiting
troika
and
take
her
to
the
village
of
kamenka
forty
miles
from
moscow
where
they
had
a
defrocked
priest
waiting
who
was
to
marry
them
in
kamenka
a
relay
was
ready
to
take
them
to
the
warsaw
road
and
from
there
they
were
to
go
abroad
by

anatole
had
a
passport

over
tea
in
dolokhovs
big
study
its
walls
decorated
up
to
the
ceiling
with
persian
rugs
bearskins
and
weapons
sat
dolokhov
in
a
traveling
jacket
and
boots
before
an
open
bureau
on
which
lay
an
abacus
and
wads
of
money
anatole
in
an
unbuttoned
uniform
paced
from
the
room
where
the
witnesses
sat
through
the
study
into
the
back
room
where
his
french
valet
and
others
were
packing
the
last
of
his
belongings
dolokhov
was
counting
money
and
writing
it
down
well
he
said

khvostikov
two
thousand

dolokhov
showing
him
the
note

it
right
yes
of

said
anatole
who
obviously
was
not
listening
to
dolokhov
and
with
a
smile
that
never
left
his
face
he
looked
straight
ahead
dolokhov
slammed
the
bureau
shut
and
turned
to
anatole
with
a
mocking
smile

he

condescendingly

room
again
and
trying
to
focus
his
attention
looked
at
dolokhov
obviously
obeying
him
involuntarily

anatole
began
wincing
again
i
explained
it
to
you
didnt
i
and
with
that
special
partiality
which
dullwitted
people
have
when
they
work
out
some
conclusion
for
themselves
anatole
repeated
the
argument
that
he
had
repeated
to
dolokhov
a
hundred
times
i
explained
to
you
that
ive
decided
if
this
marriage
is
invalid
he
said
counting
off
one
finger
it
means
im
not
answerable
and
if
its
valid
it
makes
no
difference

hell
said
anatole
and
seizing
himself
by
the
hair
he
went
to
the
next
room
came
back
at
once
and
sat
with
his
legs
tucked
under
in
an
armchair
in
front
of
dolokhov
devil
knows
what
it
is
eh
feel
how
its
pounding
he
took
dolokhovs
hand
and
put
it
to
his
heart
ah
quel
pied
mon
cher
quel
regard
une
d233esse
eh
dolokhov
with
a
cold
smile
and
flashing
his
beautiful
insolent
eyes
looked
at
him
clearly
wanting
to
taunt
him
a
little
longer
well
when
the
moneys
gone
what
then
what
then
eh
anatole
repeated
genuinely
puzzled
by
the
thought
of
the
future
what
then
i
dont
know
what
thenbut
why
talk
nonsense
he
looked
at
his
watch
its
time
anatole
went
to
the
back
room
well
will
you
make
it
soon
no
dawdling
here
he
shouted
at
the
servants
dolokhov
put
the
money
away
and
shouting
for
his
man
so
as
to
order
food
and
drinks
served
before
the
road
went
to
the
room
where
makarin
and
khvostikov
were
sitting
anatole
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
study
propped
on
his
elbows
smiling
pensively
and
whispering
tenderly
to
himself
go
and
eat
something
or
drink
dolokhov
called
to
him
from
the
other
room
i
dont
want
to
anatole
replied
still
smiling
come
balagas
here
anatole
got
up
and
went
to
the
dining
room
balaga
was
a
famous
troika
driver
who
had
known
dolokhov
and
anatole
for
six
years
already
and
furnished
them
with
his
troikas
more
than
once
when
anatoles
regiment
was
stationed
in
tver
he
had
taken
him
from
tver
in
the
evening
brought
him
to
moscow
by
dawn
and
taken
him
back
the
next
night
more
than
once
he
had
driven
dolokhov
when
he
had
had
to
elude
pursuit
more
than
once
he
had
taken
them
for
a
ride
around
town
with
gypsies
and
damsels
as
balaga
called
them
more
than
once
while
in
their
employ
he
had
run
down
folk
and
cabbies
in
moscow
and
his
gentlemen
as
he
called
them
had
always
helped
him
out
more
than
one
horse
had
been
overdriven
under
them
more
than
once
he
had
been
beaten
by
them
more
than
once
they
had
gotten
him
drunk
on
champagne
and
madeira
which
he
liked
and
he
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
each
of
them
which
would
have
sent
an
ordinary
man
to
siberia
long
ago
they
often
invited
balaga
to
go
carousing
with
them
made
him
drink
and
dance
with
the
gypsies
and
more
than
one
thousand
of
their
roubles
had
gone
through
his
hands
while
in
their
service
he
risked
his
life
and
his
hide
twenty
times
a
year
and
he
had
driven
more
horses
to
death
than
they
had
paid
him
roubles
but
he
liked
them
liked
their
mad
rides
at
twelve
miles
an
hour
liked
overturning
other
cabbies
and
running
down
moscow
pedestrians
and
going
at
full
gallop
down
the
moscow
streets
he
liked
hearing
the
wild
shouts
of
drunken
voices
behind
him
faster
faster
when
it
was
impossible
to
go
any
faster
he
liked
giving
a
painful
lash
on
the
neck
to
a
peasant
who
even
without
that
was
trying
more
dead
than
alive
to
get
out
of
his
way
real
gentlemen
he
thought
anatole
and
dolokhov
also
liked
balaga
for
his
masterful
driving
and
for
liking
the
same
things
they
did
with
others
balaga
haggled
charged
twentyfive
roubles
for
a
twohour
ride
and
very
rarely
went
himself
but
sent
the
boys
who
worked
for
him
but
with
his
gentlemen
as
he
called
them
he
always
went
himself
and
never
asked
anything
for
his
work
only
when
he
learned
through
valets
that
there
was
money
there
would
he
come
once
every
few
months
in
the
morning
sober
and
with
low
bows
ask
them
to
help
him
out
the
gentlemen
always
invited
him
to
sit
down
do

dashingly
cocked
to

it
why
sonya

and
she
sobbed
with
that
despair
with
which
people
weep
only
over
a
grief
of
which
they
feel
themselves
the
cause
marya
dmitrievna
tried
to
speak
again
but
natasha
shouted
go
away
go
away
you
all
hate
me
and
despise
me
and
she
threw
herself
onto
the
sofa
again
marya
dmitrievna
went
on
for
some
time
admonishing
natasha
and
impressing
upon
her
that
all
this
must
be
kept
from
the
count
that
no
one
would
learn
anything
if
only
natasha
would
take
it
upon
herself
to
forget
it
all
and
not
let
anyone
see
that
something
had
happened
natasha
did
not
answer
she
was
no
longer
weeping
but
she
became
feverish
and
began
to
shiver
marya
dmitrievna
put
a
pillow
under
her
head
covered
her
with
two
blankets
and
herself
brought
her
limeflower
tea
but
natasha
did
not
respond
to
her
well
let
her
sleep
said
marya
dmitrievna
going
out
of
the
room
thinking
she
was
asleep
but
natasha
was
not
asleep
and
her
fixed
wideopen
eyes
looked
straight
ahead
from
her
pale
face
natasha
did
not
sleep
all
that
night
did
not
weep
and
did
not
speak
with
sonya
who
got
up
several
times
and
went
over
to
her
by
lunchtime
the
next
day
as
promised
count
ilya
andreich
arrived
from
his
estate
near
moscow
he
was
very
cheerful
the
business
with
the
buyer
was
working
out
and
nothing
now
kept
him
in
moscow
and
separated
from
the
countess
whom
he
missed
marya
dmitrievna
met
him
and
told
him
that
natasha
had
fallen
quite
ill
the
day
before
that
they
had
sent
for
the
doctor
but
that
she
was
better
now
natasha
did
not
leave
her
room
that
morning
with
compressed
cracked
lips
and
a
dry
fixed
gaze
she
sat
by
the
window
and
anxiously
peered
at
people
driving
down
the
street
and
hurriedly
turned
around
when
anyone
came
into
the
room
she
was
obviously
waiting
for
news
of
him
waiting
for
him
to
come
himself
or
write
to
her
when
the
count
came
into
her
room
she
anxiously
turned
at
the
sound
of
a
mans
footsteps
and
her
face
assumed
its
former
cold
and
even
angry
expression
she
did
not
even
get
up
to
meet
him
what
is
it
my
angel
are
you
ill
asked
the
count
natasha
paused
yes
ill
she
replied
to
the
counts
anxious
inquiries
as
to
why
she
was
so
crushed
and
whether
anything
was
wrong
with
her
fianc233
she
assured
him
that
nothing
was
wrong
and
asked
him
not
to
worry
marya
dmitrievna
confirmed
for
the
count
natashas
assurances
that
nothing
had
happened
the
count
judging
by
the
supposed
illness
by
his
daughters
being
upset
by
the
embarrassed
faces
of
sonya
and
marya
dmitrievna
saw
clearly
that
something
must
have
happened
in
his
absence
but
it
was
so
frightening
for
him
to
think
that
anything
shameful
had
happened
with
his
beloved
daughter
and
he
so
loved
his
cheerful
tranquillity
that
he
avoided
questions
and
kept
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
there
was
nothing
in
particular
and
only
grieved
that
owing
to
her
illness
they
had
to
put
off
leaving
for
the
country
xix
since
the
day
his
wife
arrived
in
moscow
pierre
had
been
intending
to
go
somewhere
only
so
as
not
to
be
there
with
her
soon
after
the
rostovs
arrival
in
moscow
the
impression
natasha
made
on
him
forced
him
to
hasten
to
carry
out
his
intention
he
went
to
tver
to
see
the
widow
of
iosif
alexeevich
who
had
long
ago
promised
to
give
him
the
deceaseds
papers
when
pierre
returned
to
moscow
he
was
handed
a
letter
from
marya
dmitrievna
who
asked
him
to
come
to
her
on
a
very
important
matter
concerning
andrei
bolkonsky
and
his
fianc233e
pierre
had
been
avoiding
natasha
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
a
stronger
feeling
for
her
than
a
married
man
ought
to
have
for
his
friends
fianc233e
yet
some
sort
of
fate
constantly
brought
them
together
whats
happened
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
me
he
wondered
as
he
was
getting
dressed
to
go
to
marya
dmitrievnas
if
only
prince
andrei
would
come
quickly
and
marry
her
thought
pierre
on
his
way
to
see
mrs
akhrosimov
on
tverskoy
boulevard
someone
called
to
him
pierre
been
back
long
a
familiar
voice
cried
to
him
pierre
raised
his
head
in
a
double
sleigh
harnessed
to
two
gray
trotters
that
kicked
snow
back
into
the
dashboard
anatole
flashed
by
with
his
usual
friend
makarin
anatole
was
sitting
upright
in
the
classical
pose
of
a
military
fop
the
lower
his
face
wrapped
in
a
beaver
collar
his
head
bent
slightly
his
face
was
ruddy
and
fresh
his
whiteplumed
hat
was
cocked
revealing
his
curled
and
pomaded
hair
sprinkled
with
fine
snow
yes
indeed
theres
a
true
wise
man
thought
pierre
he
doesnt
see
anything
beyond
the
present
moment
of
pleasure
nothing
troubles
himand
therefore
hes
always
cheerful
content
and
calm
id
give
anything
to
be
like
him
pierre
thought
with
envy
in
mrs
akhrosimovs
front
hall
the
valet
helping
pierre
out
of
his
fur
coat
said
that
marya
dmitrievna
asked
him
to
come
to
her
bedroom
opening
the
door
to
the
reception
room
pierre
saw
natasha
sitting
by
the
window
with
a
thin
pale
and
spiteful
face
she
glanced
at
him
frowned
and
with
an
expression
of
cold
dignity
left
the
room
whats
happened
asked
pierre
coming
into
marya
dmitrievnas
bedroom
a
fine
business
answered
marya
dmitrievna
fiftyeight
years
ive
lived
in
this
world
and
ive
never
seen
such
a
disgrace
and
after
asking
pierre
to
give
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
keep
silent
about
everything
he
was
about
to
learn
marya
dmitrievna
told
him
that
natasha
had
refused
her
fianc233
without
her
parents
knowledge
and
that
the
cause
of
this
refusal
was
anatole
kuragin
with
whom
pierres
wife
had
brought
her
together
and
with
whom
natasha
was
going
to
elope
in
her
fathers
absence
so
as
to
get
married
secretly
pierre
his
shoulders
hunched
and
his
mouth
gaping
listened
to
what
marya
dmitrievna
was
telling
him
and
could
not
believe
his
ears
prince
andreis
fianc233e
so
deeply
loved
this
once
sweet
natasha
rostov
to
exchange
bolkonsky
for
that
fool
anatole
who
was
already
married
pierre
knew
the
secret
of
his
marriage
and
fall
in
love
with
him
so
much
as
to
agree
to
elope
with
himthat
pierre
could
not
understand
and
could
not
imagine
the
sweet
impression
of
natasha
whom
he
had
known
since
she
was
a
child
could
not
be
combined
in
his
soul
with
the
new
notion
of
her
baseness
stupidity
and
cruelty
he
remembered
his
wife
theyre
all
the
same
he
said
to
himself
thinking
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
have
the
sad
lot
of
being
connected
with
a
vile
woman
but
still
he
pitied
prince
andrei
to
the
point
of
tears
pitied
his
pride
and
the
more
he
pitied
his
friend
the
greater
was
the
contempt
and
even
loathing
with
which
he
thought
of
this
natasha
who
had
just
walked
past
him
in
the
reception
room
with
an
expression
of
such
cold
dignity
he
did
not
know
that
natashas
soul
was
filled
with
despair
shame
humiliation
and
that
it
was
not
her
fault
that
her
face
happened
to
express
calm
dignity
and
severity
what
do
you
mean
get
married
said
pierre
to
marya
dmitrievnas
words
he
cant
get
married
he
is
married
worse
and
worse
by
the
hour
said
marya
dmitrievna
a
fine
lad
what
a
scoundrel
and
shes
waiting
shes
been
waiting
for
two
days
we
must
tell
her
at
least
shell
stop
waiting
having
learned
from
pierre
the
details
of
anatoles
marriage
having
vented
her
anger
in
abusive
words
marya
dmitrievna
told
him
why
she
had
summoned
him
marya
dmitrievna
was
afraid
that
the
count
or
bolkonsky
who
might
come
any
minute
would
find
out
about
the
affair
which
she
intended
to
conceal
from
them
and
challenge
kuragin
to
a
duel
and
therefore
she
asked
him
to
order
his
brotherinlaw
on
her
behalf
to
leave
moscow
and
not
dare
let
her
set
eyes
on
him
again
pierre
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
only
now
realizing
the
danger
which
threatened
the
old
count
and
nikolai
and
prince
andrei
briefly
and
precisely
laying
out
her
demands
for
him
she
let
him
out
to
the
drawing
room
mind
you
the
count
doesnt
know

said
to
him
and

wait
for

for
dinner
if
you
like
marya
dmitrievna
called
out
to
pierre
pierre
met
the
old
count
he
was
embarrassed
and
upset
that
morning
natasha
had
told
him
that
she
had
refused
bolkonsky
trouble
trouble
mon

he
said
to

glad

marriage
suppose

a
good
man
but
thered
be
no
happiness
against
his
fathers

and
natasha
wont
remain
without
suitors
but
its
been
going
on
for
so
long
and
how
is
it
shes
taken
such
a
step
without

her
father
or
mother
and
now
shes
sick
and
god

what
will
happen
its
bad
count
its
bad
with
daughters
and
no
mother
pierre
saw
that
the
count
was
very
upset
he
tried
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
but
the
count
kept
coming
back
to
his
grief
sonya
came
into
the
drawing
room
with
an
alarmed
face
natashas
not
very
well
shes
in
her
room
and
would
like
to
see
you
marya
dmitrievna
is
with
her
and
also
asks
you
to
come
yes
youre
close
friends
with
bolkonsky
she
probably
wants
you
to
tell
him
something
ah
my
god
my
god
everything
was
so
nice
and
clutching
at
his
sparse
gray
whiskers
the
count
left
the
room
marya
dmitrievna
had
told
natasha
that
anatole
was
married
natasha
refused
to
believe
her
and
demanded
that
pierre
himself
confirm
it
sonya
told
that
to
pierre
as
she
was
bringing
him
down
the
corridor
to
natashas
room
natasha
pale
stern
was
sitting
next
to
marya
dmitrievna
and
her
feverishly
glittering
questioning
gaze
met
pierre
just
at
the
door
she
did
not
smile
did
not
nod
to
him
she
only
looked
at
him
fixedly
and
her
gaze
asked
him
only
this
was
he
a
friend
or
like
everybody
else
an
enemy
in
relation
to
anatole
pierre
himself
evidently
did
not
exist
for
her
he
knows
everything
said
marya
dmitrievna
pointing
to
pierre
and
addressing
natasha
let
him
tell
you
whether
ive
spoken
the
truth
as
a
wounded
animal
at
bay
looks
at
the
approaching
dogs
and
hunters
natasha
looked
from
one
to
the
other
natalya
ilyinichna
pierre
began
lowering
his
eyes
and
feeling
pity
for
her
and
loathing
for
the
operation
he
had
to
perform
it
should
make
no
difference
to
you
whether
its
true
or
not
because
so
its
not
true
that
hes
married
no
its
true
he
was
married
and
long
ago
she
asked
word
of
honor
pierre
gave
her
his
word
of
honor
is
he
still
here
she
asked
quickly
yes
i
just
saw
him
she
was
obviously
unable
to
speak
and
made
signs
with
her
hands
that
they
should
leave
her
xx
pierre
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
left
the
room
at
once
and
drove
off
he
drove
around
town
looking
for
anatole
kuragin
at
the
thought
of
whom
now
all
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
and
he
found
it
difficult
to
catch
his
breath
he
was
not
at
the
ice
hills
not
at
the
gypsies
not
at
comonenos
pierre
drove
to
the
club
in
the
club
everything
was
going
on
in
its
usual
order
the
guests
who
had
come
for
dinner
were
sitting
in
groups
and
greeted
pierre
and
talked
about
town
news
the
footman
having
greeted
him
told
him
knowing
his
circle
and
his
habits
that
a
place
had
been
reserved
for
him
in
the
small
dining
room
that
prince
mikhail
zakharych
was
in
the
library
and
that
pavel
timofeich
had
not
arrived
yet
one
of
pierres
acquaintances
in
the
middle
of
talking
about
the
weather
asked
him
whether
he
had
heard
about
kuragins
abduction
of
miss
rostov
of
which
there
was
talk
in
town
and
whether
it
was
true
pierre
laughed
and
said
it
was
nonsense
because
he
had
just
been
at
the
rostovs
he
asked
everyone
about
anatole
one
man
told
him
that
he
had
not
come
yet
another
that
he
would
be
dining
there
that
evening
pierre
found
it
strange
to
look
at
this
calm
indifferent
crowd
of
people
who
did
not
know
what
was
happening
in
his
soul
he
paced
about
waiting
until
everyone
had
come
and
having
waited
in
vain
for
anatole
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
drove
home
anatole
whom
he
had
been
seeking
dined
that
day
at
dolokhovs
and
discussed
with
him
how
to
mend
the
spoiled
affair
it
seemed
necessary
to
him
that
he
see
miss
rostov
in
the
evening
he
went
to
his
sisters
to
discuss
with
her
the
means
of
arranging
this
meeting
when
pierre
having
driven
in
vain
all
over
moscow
returned
home
the
valet
told
him
that
prince
anatole
vassilievich
was
with
the
countess
the
countesss
drawing
room
was
filled
with
guests
pierre
without
greeting
his
wife
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
arrival
she
was
more
hateful
to
him
than
ever
at
that
moment
entered
the
drawing
room
and
seeing
anatole
went
up
to
him
ah
pierre
said
the
countess
going
to
her
husband
you
dont
know
what
position
our
anatole
she
stopped
seeing
in
her
husbands
lowered
head
his
face
his
flashing
eyes
his
resolute
stride
that
terrible
expression
of
rage
and
strength
which
she
knew
and
had
experienced
personally
after
his
duel
with
dolokhov
wherever
you
are
there
is
depravity
and
evil
pierre
said
to
his
wife
anatole
come
i
must
have
a
talk
with
you
he
said
in
french
anatole
glanced
at
his
sister
and
got
up
obediently
ready
to
follow
pierre
pierre
having
taken
him
by
the
arm
pulled
him
to
himself
and
started
out
of
the
room
si
vous
vous
permettez
dans
mon
salon
h233l232ne
said
in
a
whisper
but
pierre
left
the
room
without
answering
her
anatole
walked
behind
him
with
his
usual
swaggering
stride
but
uneasiness
could
be
noticed
on
his
face
having
gone
into
his
study
pierre
closed
the
door
and
addressed
anatole
without
looking
at
him
so
you
promised
countess
rostov
to
marry
her
you
were
going
to
elope
with
her
my
dear
anatole
answered
in
french
as
the
whole
conversation
went
on
i
dont
consider
myself
obliged
to
answer
questions
put
in
such
a
tone
pierres
face
pale
before
then
became
distorted
with
rage
he
seized
anatole
by
the
collar
of
his
uniform
with
his
big
hand
and
began
shaking
him
from
side
to
side
until
anatoles
face
acquired
a
sufficiently
frightened
expression
when
i
say
i
must
talk
with
you
pierre
repeated
well
thats
stupid
eh
said
anatole
feeling
a
button
of
his
collar
which
had
been
ripped
out
with
a
bit
of
cloth
youre
a
scoundrel
and
a
villain
and
i
dont
know
what
restrains
me
from
the
pleasure
of
smashing
your
head
with
this
said
pierre
expressing
himself
so
artificially
because
he
was
speaking
in
french
he
picked
up
a
heavy
paperweight
and
raised
it
threateningly
but
at
once
hastened
to
set
it
down
again
did
you
promise
to
marry
her
iii
didnt
think
anyhow
i
never
promised
because
pierre
interrupted
him
do
you
have
letters
from
her
do
you
pierre
repeated
stepping
towards
anatole
anatole
looked
at
him
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
at
once
took
out
his
wallet
pierre
took
the
letter
he
handed
him
and
pushing
aside
the
table
that
stood
in
his
way
dropped
onto
the
sofa
je
ne
serai
pas
violent
ne
craignez
rien
said
pierre
responding
to
anatoles
gesture
of
fear
lettersone
said
pierre
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
to
himself
second
he
went
on
after
a
moments
silence
getting
up
again
and
beginning
to
pace
the
room
tomorrow
you
are
to
leave
moscow
but
how
can
i
third
pierre
went
on
not
listening
to
him
you
are
never
to
say
a
word
about
what
happened
between
you
and
the
countess
i
know
i
cant
forbid
you
that
but
if
theres
a
spark
of
conscience
in
you
pierre
silently
paced
the
room
several
times
anatole
sat
by
the
table
frowning
and
biting
his
lips
cant
you
understand
finally
that
besides
your
own
pleasure
there
is
the
happiness
the
peace
of
other
people
that
you
are
ruining
a
whole
life
just
because
you
want
to
have
fun
amuse
yourself
with
women
like
my
spousewith
them
youre
within
your
rights
they
know
what
you
want
from
them
theyre
armed
against
you
with
the
same
experience
of
depravity
but
to
promise
a
girl
youll
marry
herto
deceive
her
make
offhow
can
you
not
understand
that
its
as
mean
as
to
beat
an
old
man
or
a
child
pierre
paused
and
looked
at
anatole
now
not
with
a
wrathful
but
with
a
questioning
gaze
that
i
dont
know
eh
said
anatole
taking
heart
as
pierre
overcame
his
wrath
that
i
dont
know
and
dont
want
to
know
he
said
not
looking
at
pierre
and
with
a
slight
trembling
of
his
lower
jaw
but
you
have
spoken
to
me
in
such
wordsmean
and
the
likeas
i
comme
un
homme
dhonneur
will
not
allow
to
anyone
pierre
looked
at
him
in
surprise
unable
to
grasp
what
he
wanted
though
it
was
just
between
us
anatole
went
on
i
cannot
what
do
you
want
satisfaction
pierre
said
mockingly
you
might
at
least
take
your
words
back
eh
if
you
want
me
to
fulfill
your
wishes
eh
i
take
them
back
i
take
them
back
said
pierre
and
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
pierre
glanced
involuntarily
at
the
tornoff
button
and
money
if
you
need
it
for
the
road
anatole
smiled
the
expression
of
that
timorous
and
mean
smile
known
to
him
from
his
wife
made
pierre
explode
oh
mean
heartless
breed
he
said
and
walked
out
of
the
room
the
next
day
anatole
left
for
petersburg
xxi
pierre
went
to
marya
dmitrievnas
to
inform
her
of
the
fulfillment
of
her
wish
of
the
banishment
of
kuragin
from
moscow
the
whole
house
was
in
fear
and
agitation
natasha
was
very
ill
and
as
marya
dmitrievna
told
him
in
secret
on
the
same
night
when
it
was
announced
to
her
that
anatole
was
married
she
had
poisoned
herself
with
arsenic
which
she
had
obtained
on
the
quiet
having
swallowed
a
little
she
had
become
so
frightened
that
she
had
awakened
sonya
and
told
her
what
she
had
done
the
necessary
measures
against
the
poison
had
been
taken
in
time
and
she
was
now
out
of
danger
but
still
so
weak
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
taking
her
to
the
country
and
the
countess
had
been
sent
for
pierre
saw
the
bewildered
count
and
the
tearful
sonya
but
could
not
see
natasha
pierre
dined
at
the
club
that
day
and
heard
talk
on
all
sides
about
the
attempted
abduction
of
miss
rostov
and
he
stubbornly
refuted
that
talk
assuring
everyone
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
it
than
that
his
brotherinlaw
had
made
a
proposal
to
the
rostovs
and
received
a
refusal
pierre
felt
it
was
his
duty
to
conceal
the
whole
affair
and
restore
natashas
reputation
he
fearfully
awaited
prince
andreis
return
and
went
to
the
old
prince
every
day
to
ask
about
it
through
mlle
bourienne
prince
nikolai
andreich
knew
all
the
rumors
going
around
town
and
had
read
the
note
to
princess
marya
in
which
natasha
refused
her
fianc233
he
seemed
more
cheerful
than
usual
and
awaited
his
son
with
great
impatience
several
days
after
anatoles
departure
pierre
received
a
note
from
prince
andrei
informing
him
of
his
arrival
and
asking
pierre
to
come
to
see
him
prince
andrei
on
the
first
moment
of
his
arrival
in
moscow
had
received
from
his
father
natashas
note
to
princess
marya
in
which
she
refused
her
fianc233
mlle
bourienne
had
stolen
this
note
from
princess
marya
and
given
it
to
the
prince
and
had
heard
stories
from
his
father
about
natashas
abduction
with
additions
prince
andrei
had
arrived
the
evening
before
pierre
came
to
see
him
the
next
morning
pierre
expected
to
find
prince
andrei
in
almost
the
same
state
natasha
was
in
and
was
therefore
surprised
when
going
into
the
drawing
room
he
heard
prince
andreis
loud
voice
from
the
study
animatedly
saying
something
about
some
petersburg
intrigue
now
and
then
the
voice
of
the
old
prince
and
of
someone
else
interrupted
him
princess
marya
came
out
to
meet
pierre
she
sighed
indicating
with
her
eyes
the
door
of
the
room
where
prince
andrei
was
obviously
wishing
to
express
her
sympathy
for
his
grief
but
pierre
saw
from
princess
maryas
face
that
she
was
glad
both
of
what
had
happened
and
of
how
her
brother
had
taken
the
news
of
his
fianc233es
betrayal
he
said
he
had
expected
it
she
said
i
know
his
pride
wont
allow
him
to
express
his
feelings
but
still
he
bore
it
better
much
better
than
i
expected
evidently
this
is
how
it
had
to
be
but
can
it
all
be
over
completely
said
pierre
princess
marya
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
she
did
not
understand
how
it
was
even
possible
to
ask
about
it
pierre
went
into
the
study
prince
andrei
quite
changed
grown
visibly
healthier
but
with
a
new
crosswise
wrinkle
between
his
brows
in
civilian
dress
stood
facing
his
father
and
prince
meshchersky
arguing
heatedly
and
making
energetic
gestures
the
talk
was
about
speransky
the
news
of
whose
sudden
exile
and
alleged
treason
had
just
reached
moscow
now
everybody
who
admired
him
a
month
ago
denounces
and
accuses
him
prince
andrei
was
saying
including
those
who
were
unable
to
understand
his
goals
its
very
easy
to
judge
a
man
in
disgrace
and
shift
the
mistakes
of
others
onto
him
but
i
say
that
if
there
was
anything
good
done
during
this
reign
it
was
done
by
himby
him
alone
he
stopped
seeing
pierre
his
face
twitched
and
at
once
assumed
a
spiteful
expression
and
posterity
will
give
him
credit
he
finished
and
at
once
turned
to
pierre
well
how
are
you
still
getting
fatter
he
said
animatedly
but
the
newly
appeared
wrinkle
cut
still
more
deeply
into
his
brow
yes
im
in
good
health
he
replied
to
pierres
question
and
grinned
it
was
clear
to
pierre
that
his
grin
said
im
in
good
health
but
nobody
needs
my
good
health
having
said
a
few
words
to
pierre
about
the
terrible
road
from
the
polish
border
and
about
having
met
people
in
switzerland
who
knew
pierre
and
about
m
dessales
whom
he
had
brought
from
abroad
as
a
tutor
for
his
son
prince
andrei
again
mixed
heatedly
into
the
conversation
about
speransky
which
was
still
going
on
between
the
two
old
men
if
there
was
treason
and
there
were
proofs
of
his
secret
communications
with
napoleon
they
would
be
made
public
he
said
heatedly
and
hastily
personally
i
dont
like
and
have
never
liked
speransky
but
i
do
like
justice
pierre
now
recognized
in
his
friend
the
all
too
familiar
need
to
worry
and
argue
about
things
extraneous
to
him
only
in
order
to
stifle
his
all
too
painful
innermost
thoughts
when
prince
meshchersky
left
prince
andrei
took
pierre
by
the
arm
and
invited
him
to
the
room
he
had
been
given
there
was
a
rumpled
bed
in
the
room
and
open
suitcases
and
trunks
prince
andrei
went
over
to
one
of
them
and
took
out
a
box
from
the
box
he
took
a
bundle
of
papers
he
did
it
all
silently
and
very
quickly
he
straightened
up
and
cleared
his
throat
his
face
was
frowning
his
lips
were
compressed
forgive
me
for
troubling
you
pierre
realized
that
prince
andrei
wanted
to
talk
about
natasha
and
his
broad
face
expressed
regret
and
compassion
this
expression
of
pierres
face
angered
prince
andrei
he
went
on
resolutely
in
a
ringing
and
unpleasant
voice
i
have
received
a
refusal
from
countess
rostov
and
rumors
have
reached
me
about
her
hand
being
sought
by
your
brotherinlaw
or
something
like
that
is
it
true
both
true
and
not
true
pierre
began
but
prince
andrei
interrupted
him
here
are
her
letters
he
said
and
her
portrait
he
took
the
bundle
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
pierre
give
this
to
the
countessif
you
see
her
shes
very
ill
said
pierre
so
shes
still
here
asked
prince
andrei
and
prince
kuragin
he
asked
quickly
he
left
long
ago
she
was
near
death
i
deeply
regret
her
illness
said
prince
andrei
he
grinned
coldly
spitefully
unpleasantly
like
his
father
but
mr
kuragin
did
not
then
bestow
his
hand
upon
countess
rostov
andrei
asked
he
snorted
through
his
nose
several
times
he
couldnt
marry
because
hes
already
married
said
pierre
prince
andrei
laughed
unpleasantly
again
resembling
his
father
and
where
is
he
now
your
brotherinlaw
may
i
ask
he
said
he
left
for
peterhowever
i
dont
know
said
pierre
it
makes
no
difference
said
prince
andrei
tell
countess
rostov
that
she
was
and
is
completely
free
and
that
i
wish
her
all
the
best
pierre
took
the
bundle
of
papers
prince
andrei
as
if
trying
to
remember
if
he
had
something
else
to
say
or
waiting
for
pierre
to
say
something
stood
looking
at
him
with
fixed
eyes
listen
do
you
remember
our
argument
in
petersburg
asked
pierre
remember
about
i
do
prince
andrei
said
hastily
i
said
that
a
fallen
woman
should
be
forgiven
but
i
did
not
say
that
i
could
forgive
i
cannot
but
can
this
be
compared
said
pierre
prince
andrei
interrupted
him
he
cried
sharply
yes
to
ask
for
her
hand
again
to
be
magnanimous
and
all
thatyes
its
very
noble
but
i
cant
walk
sur
les
bris233es
de
monsieur
if
you
wish
to
be
my
friend
never
speak
to
me
of
thatof
all
that
well
goodbye
you
will
deliver
it
pierre
left
and
went
to
see
the
old
prince
and
princess
marya
the
old
man
seemed
more
animated
than
usual
princess
marya
was
the
same
as
ever
but
pierre
saw
in
her
beyond
her
compassion
for
her
brother
her
joy
that
her
brothers
marriage
had
been
thwarted
looking
at
them
pierre
realized
what
contempt
and
spite
they
all
felt
for
the
rostovs
and
realized
that
it
was
impossible
in
their
presence
even
to
mention
the
name
of
her
who
could
exchange
prince
andrei
for
whomever
it
might
be
over
dinner
the
talk
turned
to
the
war
the
approach
of
which
was
becoming
obvious
prince
andrei
talked
incessantly
and
argued
now
with
his
father
now
with
the
swiss
tutor
dessales
and
seemed
more
animated
than
usualan
animation
the
moral
cause
of
which
pierre
knew
so
well
xxii
that
same
evening
pierre
went
to
the
rostovs
to
carry
out
his
errand
natasha
was
in
bed
the
count
was
at
the
club
and
pierre
having
delivered
the
letters
to
sonya
went
to
see
marya
dmitrievna
who
was
interested
to
know
how
prince
andrei
had
taken
the
news
ten
minutes
later
sonya
came
into
marya
dmitrievnas
room
natasha
absolutely
wants
to
see
count
pyotr
kirillovich
she
said
but
how
are
we
to
take
him
to
her
or
what
its
not
tidied
up
there
said
marya
dmitrievna
no
shes
dressed
and
has
come
out
to
the
drawing
room
said
sonya
marya
dmitrievna
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
when
will
the
countess
come
shes
got
me
completely
worn
out
you
watch
yourself
dont
tell
her
everything
she
turned
to
pierre
one
doesnt
have
the
heart
to
scold
her
shes
so
pathetic
so
pathetic
natasha
wasted
with
a
pale
and
stern
face
not
at
all
shamefaced
as
pierre
expected
her
to
be
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
when
pierre
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
became
flustered
obviously
undecided
whether
to
go
to
him
or
wait
for
him
pierre
hastily
went
up
to
her
he
thought
that
she
would
give
him
her
hand
as
always
but
coming
close
to
him
she
stopped
breathing
heavily
and
lowering
her
arms
lifelessly
in
exactly
the
same
pose
in
which
she
came
out
to
the
middle
of
the
room
to
sing
but
with
quite
a
different
expression
pyotr
kirilyich
she
began
speaking
quickly
prince
bolkonsky
was
your
friendis
your
friend
she
corrected
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
everything
only
was
and
that
now
it
was
all
different
he
told
me
then
to
turn
to
you
pierre
sniffed
silently
looking
at
her
up
to
then
he
had
reproached
her
in
his
soul
and
had
tried
to
despise
her
but
now
he
felt
such
pity
for
her
that
there
was
no
room
in
his
soul
for
reproach
hes
here
now
tell
himto
forforgive
me
she
stopped
and
began
to
breathe
still
more
rapidly
but
she
did
not
cry
yesill
tell
him
said
pierre
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
natasha
was
evidently
afraid
of
the
thought
that
might
have
occurred
to
pierre
no
i
know
its
all
over
she
said
hastily
no
it
can
never
be
im
only
tormented
by
the
wrong
ive
done
him
tell
him
only
that
i
beg
him
to
forgive
me
to
forgive
me
for
everything
her
whole
body
shook
and
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
a
feeling
of
pity
such
as
he
had
never
experienced
before
overflowed
pierres
soul
ill
tell
him
ill
tell
him
everything
once
more
said
pierre
butid
like
to
know
one
thing
what
asked
natashas
gaze
id
like
to
know
whether
you
loved
pierre
did
not
know
what
to
call
anatole
and
he
blushed
at
the
thought
of
him
whether
you
loved
that
bad
man
dont
call
him
bad
said
natasha
but
i
dont
know
i
dont
know
anything
she
began
to
cry
again
a
still
greater
feeling
of
pity
tenderness
and
love
took
hold
of
pierre
he
felt
tears
flowing
behind
his
spectacles
and
hoped
they
would
not
be
noticed
lets
not
talk
anymore
my
friend
said
pierre
it
seemed
so
strange
suddenly
for
natasha
to
hear
that
meek
tender
heartfelt
voice
lets
not
talk
my
friend
ill
tell
him
everything
but
i
ask
one
thing
of
youconsider
me
your
friend
and
if
you
need
help
advice
or
simply
to
pour
out
your
soul
to
somebodynot
now
but
when
your
soul
is
clearremember
me
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
ill
be
happy
if
im
able
to
pierre
became
confused
dont
talk
to
me
like
that
im
not
worthy
of
it
cried
natasha
and
she
was
about
to
leave
the
room
but
pierre
held
her
back
by
the
hand
he
knew
he
had
something
more
to
tell
her
but
when
he
said
it
he
was
surprised
at
his
words
himself
stop
it
stop
it
your
whole
life
is
ahead
of
you
he
said
ahead
of
me
no
for
me
all
is
lost
she
said
with
shame
and
selfabasement
all
is
lost
he
repeated
if
i
were
not
i
but
the
handsomest
brightest
and
best
man
in
the
world
and
i
was
free
i
would
go
on
my
knees
this
minute
and
ask
for
your
hand
and
your
love
natasha
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
wept
tears
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
and
after
glancing
at
pierre
left
the
room
pierre
too
following
her
almost
ran
out
to
the
front
hall
holding
back
the
tears
of
tenderness
and
happiness
that
choked
him
put
on
his
coat
missing
the
sleeves
and
got
into
the
sleigh
where
to
now
sir
asked
the
coachman
where
to
pierre
asked
himself
where
can
i
go
now
not
to
the
club
or
to
pay
visits
all
people
seemed
so
pitiful
so
poor
in
comparison
with
the
feeling
of
tenderness
and
love
he
experienced
in
comparison
with
that
softened
grateful
glance
she
had
given
him
at
the
last
moment
through
her
tears
home
said
pierre
throwing
open
the
bearskin
coat
on
his
broad
joyfully
breathing
chest
despite
the
ten
degrees
of
frost
it
was
cold
and
clear
above
the
dirty
semidark
streets
above
the
black
roofs
stood
the
dark
starry
sky
only
looking
at
the
sky
did
pierre
not
feel
the
insulting
baseness
of
everything
earthly
compared
with
the
height
his
soul
had
risen
to
at
the
entrance
to
arbat
square
the
huge
expanse
of
the
dark
starry
night
opened
out
to
pierres
eyes
almost
in
the
middle
of
that
sky
over
prechistensky
boulevard
stood
the
huge
bright
comet
of
the
year
1812surrounded
strewn
with
stars
on
all
sides
but
different
from
them
in
its
closeness
to
the
earth
its
white
light
and
long
raised
tailthat
same
comet
which
presaged
as
they
said
all
sorts
of
horrors
and
the
end
of
the
world
but
for
pierre
this
bright
star
with
its
long
luminous
tail
did
not
arouse
any
frightening
feeling
on
the
contrary
pierre
his
eyes
wet
with
tears
gazed
joyfully
at
this
bright
star
which
having
flown
with
inexpressible
speed
through
immeasurable
space
on
its
parabolic
course
suddenly
like
an
arrow
piercing
the
earth
seemed
to
have
struck
here
its
one
chosen
spot
in
the
black
sky
and
stopped
its
tail
raised
energetically
its
white
light
shining
and
playing
among
the
countless
other
shimmering
stars
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
this
star
answered
fully
to
what
was
in
his
softened
and
encouraged
soul
now
blossoming
into
new
life
i
since
the
end
of
the
year
1811
an
intense
arming
and
concentration
of
western
european
forces
had
begun
and
in
the
year
1812
those
forcesmillions
of
men
including
those
who
transported
and
fed
the
armymoved
from
west
to
east
to
the
borders
of
russia
towards
which
since
the
year
1811
the
forces
of
russia
had
been
drawn
in
exactly
the
same
way
on
the
twelfth
of
june
the
forces
of
western
europe
crossed
the
borders
of
russia
and
war
beganthat
is
an
event
took
place
contrary
to
human
reason
and
to
the
whole
of
human
nature
millions
of
people
committed
against
each
other
such
a
countless
number
of
villainies
deceptions
betrayals
thefts
forgeries
and
distributions
of
false
banknotes
robberies
arsons
and
murders
as
the
annals
of
all
the
law
courts
in
the
world
could
not
assemble
in
whole
centuries
and
which
at
that
period
of
time
the
people
who
committed
them
did
not
look
upon
as
crimes
what
produced
this
extraordinary
event
what
were
its
causes
historians
say
with
na239ve
assurance
that
the
causes
of
this
event
were
the
offense
inflicted
upon
the
duke
of
oldenburg
the
nonobservance
of
the
continental
system
napoleons
love
of
power
alexanders
firmness
diplomatic
mistakes
and
so
on
consequently
it
needed
only
that
metternich
rumyantsev
or
talleyrand
between
levee
and
rout
make
a
little
better
effort
and
write
a
more
skillful
dispatch
or
that
napoleon
write
to
alexander
monsieur
mon
fr232re
je
consens
224
rendre
le
duch233
au
duc
doldenbourg
and
there
would
have
been
no
war
understandably
that
was
how
the
matter
presented
itself
to
contemporaries
understandably
it
seemed
to
napoleon
that
the
war
was
caused
by
the
intrigues
of
england
as
he
said
in
fact
on
the
island
of
st
helena
understandably
to
the
members
of
the
english
parliament
it
seemed
that
the
war
was
caused
by
napoleons
love
of
power
to
prince
oldenburg
it
seemed
that
the
war
was
caused
by
the
violence
done
him
to
the
merchants
it
seemed
that
the
war
was
caused
by
the
continental
system
which
was
ruining
europe
to
the
old
soldiers
and
generals
it
seemed
that
the
chief
cause
was
the
need
to
make
use
of
them
to
the
legitimists
of
that
time
that
it
was
necessary
to
restore
les
bons
principes
and
to
the
diplomats
of
that
time
that
it
had
all
happened
because
the
alliance
between
russia
and
austria
in
1809
had
not
been
concealed
skillfully
enough
from
napoleon
and
because
memorandum
no
178
had
been
clumsily
worded
understandably
these
and
a
countless
endless
number
of
other
causes
the
number
of
which
depends
on
countless
different
points
of
view
presented
themselves
to
contemporaries
but
for
us
the
descendants
who
contemplate
the
enormity
of
the
event
in
all
its
scope
and
delve
into
its
simple
and
terrible
meaning
these
causes
seem
insufficient
for
us
it
is
not
understandable
that
millions
of
christians
killed
and
tortured
each
other
because
napoleon
was
a
lover
of
power
alexander
was
firm
english
policy
cunning
and
the
duke
of
oldenburg
offended
it
is
impossible
to
understand
what
connection
there
is
between
these
circumstances
and
the
fact
of
killing
and
violence
why
because
the
duke
of
oldenburg
was
offended
thousands
of
men
from
the
other
end
of
europe
should
kill
and
ravage
the
people
of
smolensk
and
moscow
provinces
and
be
killed
by
them
for
us
descendantswho
are
not
historians
who
are
not
carried
away
by
the
process
of
research
and
therefore
can
contemplate
events
with
unobscured
common
sensea
countless
number
of
causes
present
themselves
the
deeper
we
go
in
search
of
causes
the
more
of
them
we
find
and
each
cause
taken
singly
or
whole
series
of
causes
present
themselves
to
us
as
equally
correct
in
themselves
and
equally
false
in
their
insignificance
in
comparison
with
the
enormity
of
the
event
and
equally
false
in
their
incapacity
without
the
participation
of
all
other
coinciding
causes
to
produce
the
event
that
took
place
the
willingness
or
unwillingness
of
one
french
corporal
to
enlist
for
a
second
tour
of
duty
appears
to
us
as
good
a
cause
as
napoleons
refusal
to
withdraw
his
army
beyond
the
vistula
and
give
back
the
duchy
of
oldenburg
for
if
he
had
been
unwilling
to
serve
and
another
had
been
unwilling
and
a
third
and
a
thousandth
corporal
and
soldier
there
would
have
been
so
many
less
men
in
napoleons
army
and
there
could
have
been
no
war
if
napoleon
had
not
been
insulted
by
the
demand
to
withdraw
beyond
the
vistula
and
had
not
ordered
his
troops
to
advance
there
would
have
been
no
war
but
if
all
the
sergeants
had
been
unwilling
to
enlist
for
a
second
tour
of
duty
there
also
could
have
been
no
war
there
also
could
have
been
no
war
if
there
had
been
no
intrigues
of
the
english
and
if
there
had
been
no
prince
of
oldenburg
and
insulted
feelings
in
alexander
and
if
there
had
been
no
autocratic
power
in
russia
and
if
there
had
been
no
french
revolution
and
subsequent
dictatorship
and
empire
and
all
that
produced
the
french
revolution
and
so
on
without
any
one
of
these
causes
nothing
could
have
happened
therefore
all
these
causesbillions
of
causescoincided
so
as
to
bring
about
what
happened
and
consequently
none
of
them
was
the
exclusive
cause
of
the
event
but
the
event
had
to
take
place
simply
because
it
had
to
take
place
millions
of
men
renouncing
their
human
feelings
and
their
reason
had
to
go
from
west
to
east
and
kill
their
own
kind
just
as
several
centuries
earlier
hordes
of
men
had
gone
from
east
to
west
killing
their
own
kind
the
actions
of
napoleon
and
alexander
on
whose
word
it
seems
to
have
depended
whether
the
event
took
place
or
not
were
as
little
willed
as
the
action
of
each
soldier
who
went
into
the
campaign
by
lot
or
by
conscription
this
could
not
be
otherwise
because
for
the
will
of
napoleon
and
alexander
the
men
on
whom
the
event
seemed
to
depend
to
be
fulfilled
the
coincidence
of
countless
circumstances
was
necessary
without
any
one
of
which
the
event
could
not
have
taken
place
it
was
necessary
that
millions
of
men
in
whose
hands
the
actual
power
lay
the
soldiers
who
shot
transported
provisions
and
cannonit
was
necessary
that
they
agree
to
fulfill
this
will
of
isolated
and
weak
men
and
be
brought
to
that
by
a
countless
number
of
complex
diverse
causes
fatalism
in
history
is
inevitable
for
the
explanation
of
senseless
phenomena
that
is
those
whose
sense
we
do
not
understand
the
more
we
try
to
explain
sensibly
these
phenomena
of
history
the
more
senseless
and
incomprehensible
they
become
for
us
each
man
lives
for
himself
uses
his
freedom
to
achieve
his
personal
goals
and
feels
with
his
whole
being
that
right
now
he
can
or
cannot
do
suchandsuch
an
action
but
as
soon
as
he
does
it
this
action
committed
at
a
certain
moment
in
time
becomes
irreversible
and
makes
itself
the
property
of
history
in
which
it
has
not
a
free
but
a
predestined
significance
there
are
two
sides
to
each
mans
life
his
personal
life
which
is
the
more
free
the
more
abstract
its
interests
and
his
elemental
swarmlike
life
where
man
inevitably
fulfills
the
laws
prescribed
for
him
man
lives
consciously
for
himself
but
serves
as
an
unconscious
instrument
for
the
achievement
of
historical
universally
human
goals
an
action
once
committed
is
irrevocable
and
its
effect
coinciding
in
time
with
millions
of
actions
of
other
people
acquires
historical
significance
the
higher
a
man
stands
on
the
social
ladder
the
greater
the
number
of
people
he
is
connected
with
the
more
power
he
has
over
other
people
the
more
obvious
is
the
predestination
and
inevitability
of
his
every
action
the
hearts
of
kings
are
in
the
hands
of
god
kings
are
the
slaves
of
history
history
that
is
the
unconscious
swarmlike
life
of
mankind
uses
every
moment
of
a
kings
life
as
an
instrument
for
its
purposes
napoleon
though
now
in
1812
it
seemed
to
him
more
than
ever
that
it
depended
on
him
verser
or
not
verser
le
sang
de
ses
peuples
as
alexander
wrote
in
his
last
letter
to
him
had
never
been
more
subject
than
now
to
those
inevitable
laws
which
forced
him
acting
by
his
own
free
will
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
respect
to
himself
to
do
for
the
common
cause
for
history
that
which
had
to
be
accomplished
men
of
the
west
moved
towards
the
east
in
order
to
kill
each
other
and
by
the
law
of
the
coincidence
of
causes
the
thousands
of
minute
causes
of
this
movement
and
of
the
war
fitted
into
and
coincided
with
the
event
reproaches
for
the
nonobservance
of
the
continental
system
and
the
duke
of
oldenburg
and
the
movement
of
troops
into
prussia
undertaken
as
it
seemed
to
napoleon
only
to
achieve
an
armed
peace
and
the
french
emperors
love
and
habit
of
war
which
coincided
with
his
nations
disposition
the
enthusiasm
for
grandiose
preparations
and
the
expense
of
the
preparations
and
the
need
to
obtain
advantages
that
would
recover
the
expenses
and
the
intoxicating
honors
in
dresden
and
diplomatic
negotiations
which
according
to
the
views
of
contemporaries
were
conducted
with
a
sincere
desire
to
achieve
peace
and
which
only
wounded
the
vanity
of
both
sides
and
millions
and
millions
of
other
causes
which
fitted
into
the
event
that
was
to
be
accomplished
coinciding
with
it
when
an
apple
ripens
and
fallswhat
makes
it
fall
is
it
that
it
is
attracted
to
the
ground
is
it
that
the
stem
withers
is
it
that
the
sun
has
dried
it
up
that
it
has
grown
heavier
that
the
wind
shakes
it
that
the
boy
standing
underneath
wants
to
eat
it
no
one
thing
is
the
cause
all
this
is
only
the
coincidence
of
conditions
under
which
every
organic
elemental
event
of
life
is
accomplished
and
the
botanist
who
finds
that
the
apple
falls
because
the
cellular
tissue
degenerates
and
so
on
will
be
as
right
and
as
wrong
as
the
child
who
stands
underneath
and
says
that
the
apple
fell
because
he
wanted
to
eat
it
and
prayed
for
it
as
he
who
says
that
napoleon
went
to
moscow
because
he
wanted
to
and
perished
because
alexander
wanted
him
to
perish
will
be
both
right
and
wrong
so
he
will
be
right
and
wrong
who
says
that
an
undermined
hill
weighing
a
million
pounds
collapsed
because
the
last
worker
struck
it
a
last
time
with
his
pick
in
historical
events
the
socalled
great
men
are
labels
that
give
the
event
a
name
which
just
as
with
labels
has
the
least
connection
of
all
with
the
event
itself
their
every
action
which
to
them
seems
willed
by
themselves
in
the
historical
sense
is
not
willed
but
happens
in
connection
with
the
whole
course
of
history
and
has
been
destined
from
before

ages
ii
on

unable
to

though

diplomats
still
firmly
believed
in
the
possibility
of
peace
and
were
working
hard
towards
that
end
though
the
emperor
napoleon
himself
wrote
a

to
the

calling
him

sincerely
assuring
him
that

caught
up
with

spent
the
night
in
the
wilkowiski
forest
in
quarters
prepared
for
him
on
the
estate
of
a
polish
count
the
next

to
look
for

changed
into
a

drove
out
on

seeing
cossacks

the
spreading
steppe

alexander

unexpectedly
for
everyone
and
contrary
to
both
strategic
and
diplomatic

ordered
an
advance
and
the
next
day
his
troops
started
crossing
the

in
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
he
came
out
of
the
tent
pitched
that
day
on
the
steep
left
bank
of
the
niemen
and
watched
through
a
field
glass
the
streams
of
his
troops
flowing
out
of
the
wilkowiski
forest
and
pouring
over
the
three
bridges

across

of

with

standing

on

in

of

threw

said
the
voices
of
old
and
young
men
of
the
most
diverse
characters
and
social
positions
the
faces
of
all
these
men
had
one
common
expression
of
joy
at
the
beginning
of
the
longawaited
campaign
and
of
rapture
and
devotion
to
the
man
in
the
gray
frock
coat
who
stood
on
the
hill
on
the
thirteenth
of
june
napoleon
was
brought
a
small
purebred
arabian
horse
and
he
mounted
up
and
rode
at
a
gallop
to
one
of
the
bridges
across
the
niemen
constantly
deafened
by
rapturous
cries
which
he
evidently
put
up
with
only
because
it
was
impossible
to
forbid
them
to
express
their
love
for
him
by
these
cries
but
these
cries
that
accompanied
him
everywhere
oppressed
him
and
distracted
him
from
the
military
concerns
that
had
consumed
him
since
the
time
he
joined
the
army
he
rode
across
one
of
the
bridges
rocking
on
pontoons
to
the
other
side
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
galloped
off
in
the
direction
of
kovno
preceded
by
the
horse
guard
chasseurs
thrilled
with
happiness
enraptured
who
galloped
ahead
of
him
clearing
the
way
through
the
troops
having
come
to
the
wide
river
vilia
he
stopped
beside
a
regiment
of
polish
uhlans
that
stood
on
the
bank
vivat
the
poles
cried
just
as
rapturously
breaking
their
lines
and
crushing
each
other
in
order
to
see
him
napoleon
surveyed
the
river
dismounted
and
sat
on
a
log
that
lay
on
the
bank
at
a
wordless
sign
he
was
handed
a
field
glass
placed
it
on
the
back
of
a
happy
page
who
ran
over
and
began
to
look
at
the
other
side
then
he
immersed
himself
in
examining
a
map
laid
out
among
the
logs
without
raising
his
head
he
said
something
and
two
of
his
adjutants
rode
over
to
the
polish
uhlans
what
what
did
he
say
came
from
the
lines
of
the
polish
uhlans
as
one
adjutant
rode
up
to
them
the
order
was
to
find
a
ford
and
cross
to
the
other
side
the
colonel
of
the
polish
uhlans
a
handsome
old
man
turned
red
and
stumbling
over
his
words
from
excitement
asked
the
adjutant
whether
he
would
be
allowed
to
swim
across
the
river
with
his
uhlans
without
looking
for
a
ford
obviously
fearing
a
refusal
like
a
boy
who
asks
permission
to
get
on
a
horse
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
swim
across
the
river
before
the
emperors
eyes
the
adjutant
said
that
the
emperor
would
probably
not
be
displeased
by
this
excessive
zeal
as
soon
as
the
adjutant
said
it
the
mustached
old
officer
with
a
happy
face
and
flashing
eyes
raising
his
saber
shouted
vivat
and
commanding
the
uhlans
to
follow
him
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
river
he
angrily
spurred
his
horse
which
hesitated
under
him
and
threw
himself
into
the
water
heading
for
the
depths
where
the
current
was
swift
hundreds
of
uhlans
followed
him
it
was
cold
and
scary
in
the
middle
and
in
the
swift
current
the
uhlans
grasped
at
each
other
fell
off
their
horses
some
horses
drowned
men
drowned
as
well
others
tried
to
swim
for
it
some
in
the
saddle
others
holding
on
to
their
horses
manes
they
tried
to
swim
forward
to
the
other
side
and
though
there
was
a
ford
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
they
were
proud
to
swim
and
drown
in
this
river
before
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
sat
on
a
log
and
was
not
even
looking
at
what
they
were
doing
when
the
adjutant
returned
and
choosing
the
right
moment
allowed
himself
to
draw
the
emperors
attention
to
the
devotion
of
the
poles
to
his
person
the
little
man
in
the
gray
frock
coat
stood
up
and
summoning
berthier
to
him
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
bank
with
him
giving
him
orders
and
occasionally
glancing
with
displeasure
at
the
drowning
uhlans
who
distracted
his
attention
for
him
it
was
no
new
conviction
that
his
presence
at
all
ends
of
the
world
from
africa
to
the
steppes
of
muscovy
struck
people
in
the
same
way
and
threw
them
into
the
madness
of
selfoblivion
he
ordered
his
horse
brought
and
rode
to
his
camp
some
forty
uhlans
drowned
in
the
river
despite
the
boats
that
were
sent
to
help
most
of
the
men
were
washed
back
to
this
side
the
colonel
and
several
other
men
crossed
the
river
and
barely
managed
to
climb
out
on
the
bank
but
as
soon
as
they
climbed
out
their
streaming
wet
clothes
sticking
to
them
they
shouted
vivatgazing
rapturously
at
the
spot
where
napoleon
had
stood
but
where
he
no
longer
was
and
at
that
moment
they
considered
themselves
happy
in
the
evening
between
two
ordersone
about
the
speedy
delivery
of
forged
russian
banknotes
prepared
for
distribution
in
russia
and
the
other
about
the
shooting
of
the
saxon
caught
with
a
letter
containing
information
about
the
orders
of
the
french
armynapoleon
gave
a
third
order
about
enrolling
the
polish
colonel
who
had
needlessly
thrown
himself
into
the
river
in
the
l233gion

of
which
napoleon
himself
was
the
head

meanwhile
the
russian
emperor
had
already
spent
more
than
a
month
in
vilno
holding
reviews
and
maneuvers
nothing
was
prepared
for
the
war
which
everybody
expected
and
for
the
preparation
of
which
the
emperor
had
come
from
petersburg
there
was
no
general
plan
of
action
hesitation
over
which
plan
of
all
those
proposed
was
to
be
accepted
increased
still
more
after
the
emperors
onemonth
stay
at
headquarters
each
of
the
three
armies
had
a
separate
commander
in
chief
but
there
was
no
supreme
commander
over
all
the
armies
and
the
emperor
would
not
take
the
title
upon
himself
the
longer
the
emperor
stayed
in
vilno
the
less
and
less
did
they
prepare
for
war
grown
weary
of
expecting
it
all
the
strivings
of
the
people
who
surrounded
the
sovereign
were
it
seemed
aimed
only
at
making
the
sovereign
while
passing
the
time
pleasantly
forget
about
the
impending
war
in
the
month
of
june
after
many
balls
and
f234tes
given
by
the
polish
dignitaries
by
the
courtiers
and
by
the
sovereign
himself
the
thought
occurred
to
one
of
the
sovereigns
polish
adjutant
generals
of
giving
a
dinner
and
ball
for
the
sovereign
on
the
his
adjutant
generals
this
thought
was
greeted
joyfully
by
everyone
the
sovereign
gave
his
consent
the
adjutant
generals
collected
money
by
subscription
the
person
who
might
be
most
pleasing
to
the
sovereign
was
invited
to
be
hostess
of
the
ball
count
bennigsen
a
landowner
of
vilno
province
offered
his
country
house
for
the
f234te

the
thirteenth
of

was
the
day
fixed
for
the
dinner
ball
boat

and
fireworks
at

bennigsens

house
on
the
same
day
on
which
napoleon
gave
orders
to
cross
the
niemen
and
his
vanguard
troops
driving
back
the
cossacks
crossed
the
russian
border
alexander

the
evening
at

the
ball
given
by
his
adjutant
generals
it
was
a
gay
brilliant
f234te
connoisseurs
said
that
rarely

so
many
beauties
gathered
in
one
place
countess
bezukhov
among
other
russian
ladies
who
had
followed
the
sovereign
from
petersburg
to
vilno
was
at
this
ball
eclipsing
the
refined
polish
ladies
by
her
heavy
socalled
russian
beauty
she
was
noticed
and
the
sovereign
favored
her
with
a
dance
boris
drubetskoy
en
gar231on
playing
the
bachelor
as
he
put
it
having
left
his
wife
in
moscow
was
also
at
this
ball
and
though
not
an
adjutant
general
contributed
a
large
sum
to
the
subscription
for
the
ball
boris
was
now
a
rich
man
far
advanced
in
honors
no
longer
seeking
patronage
but
standing
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
highest
of
his
peers
at
midnight
the
dancing
was
still
going
on
h233l232ne
who
did
not
have
a
worthy
partner
invited
boris
for
the
mazurka
herself
they
sat
out
as
the
third
couple
boris
glancing
coolly
at
h233l232nes
gleaming
bare
shoulders
emerging
from
her
gown
of
dark
gauze
with
gold
talked
of
old
acquaintances
and
at
the
same
time
unnoticeably
to
himself
and
others
never
ceased
for
a
second
to
observe
the
sovereign
who
was
in
the
same
room
the
sovereign
was
not
dancing
he
stood
in
the
doorway
and
stopped
now
one
couple
now
another
with
gracious
words
that
he
alone
knew
how
to
utter
at
the
start
of
the
mazurka
boris
saw
the
adjutant
general
balashov
one
of
the
closest
persons
to
the
sovereign
go
up
to
him
and
in
uncourtly
fashion
stop
very
close
to
the
sovereign
who
was
talking
with
a
polish
lady
when
he
finished
talking
with
the
lady
the
sovereign
glanced
around
questioningly
and
evidently
realizing
that
balashov
was
acting
that
way
only
because
there
were
very
important
reasons
for
it
nodded
slightly
to
the
lady
and
turned
to
balashov
as
soon
as
balashov
began
to
speak
the
sovereigns
face
showed
astonishment
he
took
balashov
by
the
arm
and
walked
across
the
room
with
him
unconsciously
clearing
a
sevenyard
path
for
himself
on
both
sides
as
people
made
way
for
him
boris
noticed
arakcheevs
troubled
face
as
the
sovereign
walked
with
balashov
arakcheev
glancing
at
the
sovereign
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
puffing
through
his
red
nose
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
as
if
expecting
the
sovereign
to
address
him
boris
realized
that
arakcheev
envied
balashov
and
was
displeased
that
some
obviously
important
news
had
reached
the
sovereign
not
through
him
but
the
sovereign
and
balashov
went
out
without
noticing
arakcheev
through
the
door
leading
to
the
lighted
garden
arakcheev
holding
his
sword
and
looking
around
spitefully
followed
some
twenty
paces
behind
them
while
performing
the
figures
of
the
mazurka
boris
was
ceaselessly
tormented
by
the
thought
of
the
news
brought
by
balashov
and
how
to
find
it
out
before
anyone
else
during
a
figure
in
which
he
had
to
choose
a
lady
whispering
to
h233l232ne
that
he
wanted
to
choose
countess
potocki
who
seemed
to
have
gone
out
to
the
balcony
he
rushed
gliding
over
the
parquet
to
the
door
to
the
garden
and
seeing
the
sovereign
stepping
onto
the
terrace
with
balashov
stopped
the
sovereign
and
balashov
were
heading
for
the
door
boris
flustered
as
if
he
had
no
time
to
retreat
pressed
himself
deferentially
to
the
door
frame
and
lowered
his
head
the
sovereign
with
the
agitation
of
a
man
personally
offended
was
finishing
the
following
words
to
enter
russia
without
a
declaration
of
war
i
will
make
peace
only
when
not
a
single
armed
enemy
remains
on
my
soil
he
said
it
seemed
to
boris
that
the
sovereign
enjoyed
uttering
these
words
he
was
pleased
with
the
form
in
which
he
had
expressed
his
thought
but
displeased
that
boris
had
overheard
it
no
one
must
know
anything
the
sovereign
added
frowning
boris
understood
that
this
referred
to
him
and
closing
his
eyes
bowed
his
head
slightly
the
sovereign
went
back
into
the
room
and
remained
at
the
ball
for
another
half
hour
boris
was
the
first
to
learn
the
news
of
french
troops
crossing
the
niemen
and
thanks
to
that
had
the
chance
to
show
certain
important
persons
that
much
of
what
was
concealed
from
others
was
known
to
him
and
thereby
had
the
chance
to
rise
higher
in
the
opinion
of
those
persons
the
unexpected
news
of
the
french
crossing
the
niemen
was
particularly
unexpected
after
a
month
of
unfulfilled
expectation
and
that
at
a
ball
the
sovereign
in
the
first
moment
of
receiving
the
news
under
the
influence
of
indignation
and
offense
had
found
a
phrase
which
later
became
famous
which
he
liked
himself
and
which
fully
expressed
his
feelings
on
returning
home
from
the
ball
at
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sovereign
sent
for
his
secretary
shishkov
and
told
him
to
write
an
order
to
the
army
and
a
rescript
to
field
marshal
prince
saltykov
in
which
he
insistently
demanded
the
insertion
of
the
words
that
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long
as
a
single
armed
frenchman
remained
on
russian
soil
the
next
day
the
following
letter
was
sent
to
napoleon

on
the
fourteenth
of
june
at
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sovereign
having
summoned
balashov
and
read
him
his
letter
to
napoleon
ordered
him
to
carry
this
letter
and
hand
it
personally
to
the
french
emperor
sending
balashov
on
his
way
the
sovereign
again
repeated
to
him
the
words
that
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long
as
even
one
armed
enemy
remained
on
russian
soil
and
ordered
him
to
convey
these
words
to
napoleon
without
fail
the
sovereign
did
not
include
them
in
the
letter
because
he
felt
with
his
innate
tact
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
convey
these
words
at
the
moment
when
a
last
attempt
at
reconciliation
was
being
made
but
he
told
balashov
to
convey
them
without
fail
to
napoleon
in
person
having
set
out
that
same
night
accompanied
by
a
bugler
and
two
cossacks
balashov
reached
the
french
outposts
at
the
village
of
rykonty
on
the
russian
side
of
the
niemen
at
dawn
he
was
stopped
by
french
cavalry
sentinels
a
french
hussar
underofficer
in
a
raspberrycolored
uniform
and
shaggy
hat
shouted
to
the
approaching
balashov
ordering
him
to
stop
balashov
did
not
stop
at
once
but
went
on
moving
slowly
down
the
road
the
underofficer
frowning
and
muttering
some
abuse
thrust
his
horses
breast
towards
balashov
took
hold
of
his
saber
and
shouted
rudely
at
the
russian
general
asking
him
if
he
was
deaf
and
had
not
heard
what
he
was
told
balashov
gave
his
name
the
underofficer
sent
a
soldier
for
an
officer
paying
no
attention
to
balashov
the
underofficer
started
talking
with
his
comrades
about
regimental
matters
and
did
not
glance
at
the
russian
general
it
was
extremely
strange
for
balashov
after
his
closeness
to
the
highest
power
and
might
after
his
conversation
three
hours
earlier
with
the
sovereign
and
generally
in
the
habit
of
being
honored
in
his
service
to
see
here
on
russian
soil
this
hostile
and
above
all
disrespectful
treatment
of
him
by
brute
force
the
sun
was
just
beginning
to
rise
behind
the
clouds
the
air
was
fresh
and
dewy
a
herd
of
cattle
was
being
driven
down
the
road
from
the
village
from
the
fields
one
by
one
trilling
larks
sprayed
up
like
bubbles
in
water
balashov
looked
around
him
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
officer
from
the
village
the
russian
cossacks
and
the
bugler
and
the
french
hussars
silently
glanced
at
each
other
now
and
then
a
french
hussar
colonel
obviously
just
out
of
bed
came
riding
from
the
village
on
a
handsome
wellfed
gray
horse
accompanied
by
two
hussars
the
officer
the
soldiers
and
their
horses
had
a
contented
and
foppish
look
this
was
that
initial
period
of
a
campaign
when
the
troops
still
find
themselves
in
good
order
almost
on
the
level
of
a
peacetime
review
of
maneuvers
only
with
a
tinge
of
warlike
showiness
in
their
dress
and
with
a
moral
tinge
of
that
gaiety
and
enthusiasm
that
always
accompany
the
beginning
of
a
campaign
the
french
colonel
had
a
hard
time
stifling
his
yawns
but
was
courteous
and
evidently
realized
the
full
significance
of
balashov
he
led
him
past
his
soldiers
behind
the
line
and
informed
him
that
his
wish
to
be
presented
to
the
emperor
would
probably
be
fulfilled
at
once
because
as
far
as
he
knew
the
emperors
quarters
were
close
by
they
rode
through
the
village
of
rykonty
past
french
hussar
tethering
posts
sentinels
and
soldiers
who
saluted
their
colonel
and
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
russian
uniform
and
came
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
according
to
the
colonel
they
were
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
commander
of
the
division
who
would
receive
balashov
and
take
him
to
his
destination
the
sun
had
already
risen
and
shone
gaily
on
the
bright
greenery
they
had
just
ridden
up
a
hill
past
a
tavern
when
a
bunch
of
horsemen
appeared
riding
towards
them
from
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
the
head
of
whom
on
a
black
horse
its
trappings
gleaming
in
the
sun
rode
a
tall
man
in
a
plumed
hat
with
black
curled
shoulderlength
hair
in
a
red
mantle
his
long
legs
thrust
forward
as
frenchmen
ride
this
man
galloped
to
meet
balashov
his
plumes
flying
his
jewels
and
gold
galloons
shining
in
the
bright
june
sun
balashov
was
just
two
lengths
away
from
the
horseman
riding
to
meet
him
with
a
theatrically
solemn
face
in
bracelets
plumes
necklaces
and
gold
when
ulner
the
french
colonel
whispered
respectfully
le
roi
de
naples
indeed
it
was
murat
who
was
now
called
the
neapolitan
king
though
it
was
completely
incomprehensible
why
he
was
the
neapolitan
king
he
was
called
that
and
he
was
fully
convinced
of
it
himself
and
therefore
had
a
still
more
solemn
and
important
air
than
before
he
was
so
sure
that
he
was
indeed
the
neapolitan
king
that
when
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
naples
while
strolling
with
his
wife
through
the
streets
of
the
city
several
italians
had
cried
viva
il
re
he
had
turned
to
his
wife
with
a
sad
smile
and
said
les
malheureux
ils
ne
savent
pas
que
je
les
quitte
demain
but
though
he
firmly
believed
that
he
was
the
neapolitan
king
and
was
sorry
for
the
grief
of
the
subjects
he
was
abandoning
lately
after
being
called
back
into
the
service
and
especially
after
meeting
napoleon
in
danzig
when
his
august
brotherinlaw
had
said
to
him
je
vous
ai
fait
roi
pour
r233gner
224
ma
mani232re
mais
pas
224
la
v244tre
he
had
cheerfully
taken
up
his
familiar
business
and
as
a
wellfed
but
not
yet
fat
horse
still
fit
for
work
feeling
itself
in
harness
begins
to
frolic
in
the
shafts
he
having
dressed
up
as
gaudily
and
expensively
as
possible
cheerful
and
content
went
riding
down
the
roads
of
poland
not
knowing
where
or
why
himself
seeing
the
russian
general
he
threw
back
his
head
with
its
curled
shoulderlength
hair
in
a
kingly
manner
and
gave
the
french
colonel
a
questioning
glance
the
colonel
deferentially
conveyed
to
his
majesty
the
meaning
of
balashov
whose
family
name
he
could
not
pronounce
de
balmach232ve
said
the
king
overcoming
by
his
resoluteness
the
difficulty
that
the
colonel
was
faced
with
charm233
de
faire
votre
connaissance
g233n233ral
he
added
with
a
gesture
of
kingly
graciousness
as
soon
as
the
king
began
to
speak
loudly
and
quickly
all
his
kingly
dignity
instantly
left
him
and
not
noticing
it
himself
he
went
over
to
his
proper
tone
of
goodnatured
familiarity
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
withers
of
balashovs
horse
eh
bien

tout

he
said
as
if
regretting
the
circumstance
of
which
he
could
not
judge
sire
replied
balashov
lempereur
mon

la

et
comme

said
balashov
using
votre
majest233
at
every
turn
with
inevitably
affected
frequency
addressing
the
person
for
whom
this
title
was
still
a
novelty
murats
face
beamed
with
stupid
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
monsieur
de
balachoff
but
royaut233
oblige
he
felt
it
necessary
to
discuss
state
affairs
with
alexanders
envoy
as
a
king
and
ally
he
dismounted
and
taking
balashov
by
the
arm
and
moving
a
few
steps
away
from
the
suite
who
waited
respectfully
began
walking
up
and
down
with
him
trying
to
speak
significantly
he
mentioned
that
the
emperor
napoleon
was
offended
by
the
demand
to
withdraw
his
troops
from
prussia
especially
now
when
the
demand
had
become
known
to
everybody
and
the
dignity
of
france
was
offended
by
it
balashov
said
that
there
was
nothing
offensive
in
this
demand
becausemurat
interrupted
him
so
you
dont
consider
the
emperor
alexander
the
instigator
he
said
unexpectedly
with
a
goodnaturedly
stupid
smile
balashov
told
him
why
he
actually
supposed
that
the
initiator
of
the
war
was
napoleon
eh
mon

interrupted
him
again

possible
he
said
in
the
tone
of
a
conversation
between
servants
who
wish
to
remain
good
friends
despite
a
quarrel
between
their
masters
and
he
went
on
to
ask
about
the
grand
duke
about
his
health
and
to
reminisce
about
the
gay
and
amusing
time
he
spent
with
him
in
naples
then
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
his
royal
dignity
murat
straightened
up
solemnly
assumed
the
same
pose
he
had
at
his
coronation
and
with
a
wave
of
the
right
hand
said
je
ne
vous
retiens
plus
g233n233ral
je
souhaite
le
succ232s
de
votre
mission
and
his
embroidered
red
mantle
and
plumes
flying
and
his
precious
stones
glittering
he
went
towards
the
suite
that
was
respectfully
waiting
for
him
balashov
rode
on
supposing
from
murats
words
that
he
would
quite
soon
be
introduced
to
napoleon
himself
but
instead
of
meeting
napoleon
soon
he
was
detained
by
sentinels
of
davouts
infantry
corps
at
the
next
village
as
he
had
been
at
the
front
line
and
the
summoned
adjutant
of
the
corps
commander
took
him
to
the
village
to
marshal
davout
v
davout
was
the
emperor
napoleons
arakcheeva
noncowardly
arakcheev
but
equally
efficient
cruel
and
incapable
of
expressing
his
devotion
otherwise
than
by
cruelty
in
the
mechanism
of
the
state
organism
these
people
are
necessary
as
wolves
are
necessary
in
natures
organism
and
they
always
exist
always
appear
and
hold
out
however
incongruous
their
presence
and
closeness
to
the
head
of
the
government
may
seem
only
this
necessity
can
explain
how
the
cruel
arakcheev
who
personally
tore
out
grenadiers
mustaches
whose
nerves
were
too
weak
for
him
to
endure
danger
an
uneducated
and
uncourtly
man
could
hold
on
to
such
power
next
to
the
chivalrously
noble
and
gentle
character
of
alexander
balashov
found
marshal
davout
in
the
shed
of
a
peasant
cottage
sitting
on
a
barrel
and
busy
with
written
work
he
was
checking
the
accounts
an
adjutant
stood
next
to
him
it
would
have
been
possible
to
find
a
better
location
but
marshal
davout
was
one
of
those
people
who
deliberately
set
themselves
up
in
the
most
gloomy
conditions
of
life
so
as
to
have
the
right
to
be
gloomy
for
the
same
reason
they
are
always
in
a
hurry
and
stubbornly
busy
how
can
i
think
about
the
happy
side
of
human
life
when
as
you
see
im
sitting
on
a
barrel
in
a
dirty
shed
and
working
said
the
expression
of
his
face
the
chief
pleasure
and
need
of
these
people
on
meeting
lifes
animation
consists
in
throwing
their
gloomy
stubborn
activity
into
the
eyes
of
that
animation
davout
allowed
himself
this
pleasure
when
balashov
was
brought
to
him
he
immersed
himself
still
more
in
his
work
when
the
russian
general
came
in
and
looking
through
his
spectacles
at
balashovs
face
animated
by
the
impression
of
the
beautiful
morning
and
the
conversation
with
murat
he
did
not
stand
up
did
not
even
stir
but
frowned
still
more
and
grinned
spitefully
noticing
on
balashovs
face
the
unpleasant
impression
produced
by
this
reception
davout
raised
his
head
and
coldly
asked
what
he
wanted
supposing
that
such
a
reception
could
be
given
him
only
because
davout
did
not
know
that
he
was
the
emperor
alexanders
adjutant
general
and
even
his
representative
before
napoleon
balashov
hastened
to
inform
him
of
his
rank
and
purpose
contrary
to
his
expectation
davout
having
heard
balashov
out
became
still
more
stern
and
rude
wheres
your
packet
he
said
donnezle
moi
je
lenverrai
224
lempereur
balashov
said
he
was
under
orders
to
personally
deliver
the
packet
to
the
emperor
your
emperors
orders
are
carried
out
in
your
army
but
here
said
davout
you
should
do
as
youre
told
and
as
if
to
let
the
russian
general
feel
still
more
his
dependence
on
brute
force
davout
sent
his
adjutant
for
the
officer
on
duty
balashov
took
out
the
packet
that
contained
the
sovereigns
letter
and
placed
it
on
the
table
a
table
consisting
of
a
door
with
ripped
off
hinges
sticking
out
from
it
laid
over
two
barrels
davout
took
the
envelope
and
read
what
was
written
on
it
you
are
perfectly
within
your
rights
to
show
or
not
show
respect
for
me
said
balashov
but
allow
me
to
observe
that
i
have
the
honor
to
bear
the
rank
of
his
majestys
adjutant
general
davout
looked
at
him
silently
and
the
slight
trouble
and
confusion
expressed
on
balashovs
face
clearly
afforded
him
pleasure
youll
be
rendered
whats
due
you
he
said
and
putting
the
envelope
in
his
pocket
he
left
the
shed
a
minute
later
the
marshals
adjutant
m
de
castries
came
in
and
led
balashov
to
the
lodgings
prepared
for
him
balashov
had
dinner
with
the
marshal
that
day
in
the
same
shed
on
the
same
board
on
barrels
the
next
day
davout
left
early
in
the
morning
and
summoning
balashov
told
him
imposingly
that
he
asked
him
to
remain
there
to
move
along
with
the
baggage
if
such
were
the
orders
and
to
speak
with
no
one
except
m
de
castries
after
four
days
of
solitude
boredom
consciousness
of
his
dependence
and
insignificance
felt
especially
sharply
after
the
milieu
of
power
in
which
he
had
been
so
recently
after
several
marches
with
the
marshals
baggage
and
the
french
troops
who
occupied
the
entire
area
balashov
was
brought
to
vilno
now
occupied
by
the
french
through
the
same
gate
from
which
he
had
ridden
out
four
days
earlier
the
next
day
the
emperors
gentlemaninwaiting
m
de
turenne
came
to
balashov
and
conveyed
to
him
the
emperor
napoleons
wish
to
honor
him
with
an
audience
four
days
earlier
the
sentinels
of
the
preobrazhensky
regiment
were
standing
by
the
house
to
which
balashov
was
brought
now
two
french
grenadiers
stood
there
in
blue
uniforms
open
on
the
chest
and
shaggy
hats
a
convoy
of
hussars
and
uhlans
and
a
dazzling
suite
of
adjutants
pages
and
generals
expecting
napoleon
to
come
out
waited
by
the
porch
near
his
saddle
horse
and
his
mameluke
rustan
napoleon
was
to
receive
balashov
in
the
same
house
in
vilno
from
which
alexander
had
sent
him
off
vi
accustomed
though
balashov
was
to
court
solemnity
the
luxury
and
magnificence
of
the
emperor
napoleons
court
struck
him
count
turenne
led
him
into
a
large
reception
room
in
which
sat
many
generals
gentlemeninwaiting
and
polish
dignitaries
many
of
whom
balashov
had
seen
at
the
court
of
the
russian
emperor
duroc
said
that
the
emperor
napoleon
would
receive
the
russian
general
before
his
promenade
after
several
minutes
of
expectation
the
gentlemaninwaiting
on
duty
that
day
came
out
to
the
large
reception
room
and
with
a
courteous
bow
to
balashov
invited
him
to
follow
him
balashov
went
into
a
small
reception
room
from
which
there
was
one
door
to
the
study
the
same
study
from
which
the
russian
emperor
had
sent
him
off
balashov
stood
alone
for
a
couple
of
minutes
there
was
a
sound
of
hurried
footsteps
behind
the
door
both
halves
of
the
door
opened
quickly
the
gentlemaninwaiting
who
opened
them
stopped
respectfully
everything
fell
silent
and
from
the
study
came
the
sound
of
other
firm
resolute
footsteps
this
was
napoleon
he
had
just
finished
dressing
for
his
ride
he
was
in
a
dark
blue
uniform
open
over
a
white
waistcoat
which
went
down
over
his
round
stomach
white
buckskins
stretched
tight
over
the
fat
haunches
of
his
short
legs
and
jackboots
his
short
hair
had
obviously
just
been
brushed
but
one
strand
hung
loose
over
the
middle
of
his
wide
forehead
his
plump
white
neck
stood
out
sharply
against
the
black
collar
of
his
uniform
he
smelled
of
cologne
his
full
youthful
face
with
its
protruding
chin
bore
an
expression
of
gracious
and
majestic
imperial
greeting
he
came
out
springing
briskly
at
every
step
his
head
slightly
thrown
back
the
whole
of
his
stout
short
figure
with
its
broad
fat
shoulders
and
involuntarily
thrustout
stomach
and
chest
had
that
imposing
stately
look
which
pampered
fortyyearold
men
have
besides
it
was
clear
that
he
was
in
very
good
spirits
that
day
he
nodded
in
response
to
balashovs
low
and
respectful
bow
and
going
up
to
him
began
speaking
at
once
like
a
man
who
values
every
minute
of
his
time
and
who
does
not
condescend
to
prepare
his
speeches
but
is
certain
that
he
will
always
speak
well
and
say
what
needs
to
be
said
good
day
general
he
said
i
have
received
the
emperor
alexanders
letter
which
you
delivered
and
am
very
glad
to
see
you
he
glanced
into
balashovs
face
with
his
large
eyes
and
at
once
began
to
look
straight
ahead
past
him
it
was
obvious
that
balashovs
person
did
not
interest
him
in
the
least
it
was
clear
that
only
what
went
on
in
his
soul
was
of
interest
to
him
everything
that
was
outside
him
had
no
meaning
for
him
because
everything
in
the
world
as
it
seemed
to
him
depended
only
upon
his
will
i
do
not
want
and
have
never
wanted
war
he
said
but
i
was
forced
into
it
even
now
he
emphasized
this
word
i
am
prepared
to
accept
all
the
explanations
you
can
give
me
and
he
began
to
lay
out
clearly
and
briefly
the
reasons
for
his
displeasure
with
the
russian
government
judging
by
the
calmly
moderate
and
friendly
tone
with
which
the
french
emperor
spoke
balashov
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
wanted
peace
and
intended
to
enter
into
negotiations
sire
lempereur
mon
ma238tre
balashov
began
his
longprepared
speech
when
napoleon
having
finished
his
own
speech
looked
questioningly
at
the
russian
envoy
but
the
gaze
that
the
emperors
eyes
directed
at
him
confused
him
youre
confusedpull
yourself
together
napoleon
seemed
to
be
saying
to
him
looking
over
balashovs
uniform
and
saber
with
a
barely
perceptible
smile
balashov
pulled
himself
together
and
began
to
speak
he
said
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
consider
kurakins
demand
for
passports
a
sufficient
reason
for
starting
a
war
that
kurakin
had
acted
thus
by
his
own
free
will
and
without
the
consent
of
the
sovereign
that
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
want
war
and
that
there
were
no
relations
with
england
not
yet
napoleon
put
in
and
as
if
afraid
of
giving
way
to
his
emotion
he
frowned
and
inclined
his
head
slightly
thereby
letting
balashov
feel
that
he
could
go
on
having
spoken
out
everything
he
had
been
ordered
to
balashov
said
that
the
emperor
alexander
wanted
peace
but
would
not
enter
into
negotiations
otherwise
than
on
condition
thathere
balashov
hesitated
he
remembered
the
words
that
the
emperor
alexander
had
not
written
in
the
letter
but
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
inserted
without
fail
in
the
rescript
to
saltykov
and
which
he
had
ordered
balashov
to
convey
to
napoleon
balashov
remembered
the
wordsthat
not
a
single
armed
enemy
remains
on
russian
soilbut
some
complex
feeling
held
him
back
he
could
not
say
those
words
though
he
wanted
to
he
hesitated
and
said
on
condition
that
the
french
troops
withdraw
beyond
the
niemen
napoleon
noticed
balashovs
confusion
as
he
uttered
these
last
words
his
face
twitched
his
left
calf
began
to
tremble
rhythmically
without
leaving
his
place
he
began
to
speak
in
a
higher
and
more
hurried
voice
than
before
during
the
speech
that
followed
balashov
lowering
his
eyes
more
than
once
involuntarily
observed
the
trembling
of
napoleons
left
calf
which
increased
as
he
raised
his
voice
i
want
peace
no
less
than
the
emperor
alexander
he
began
have
i
not
been
doing
everything
during
these
eighteen
months
to
obtain
it
i
have
waited
eighteen
months
for
explanations
and
what
is
demanded
of
me
in
order
to
start
negotiations
he
said
frowning
and
making
an
energetically
questioning
gesture
with
his
small
white
and
plump
hand
the
withdrawal
of
your
troops
beyond
the
niemen
sire
said
balashov
beyond
the
niemen
napoleon
repeated
so
now
you
want
me
to
withdraw
beyond
the
niemen
merely
the
niemen
napoleon
repeated
looking
straight
at
balashov
balashov
lowered
his
head
respectfully
instead
of
the
demand
four
months
earlier
that
he
withdraw
from
pomerania
now
they
demanded
only
that
he
withdraw
beyond
the
niemen
napoleon
turned
quickly
and
started
pacing
the
room
you
say
that
withdrawal
beyond
the
niemen
is
demanded
of
me
in
order
to
begin
negotiations
but
in
just
the
same
way
it
was
demanded
of
me
two
months
ago
that
i
withdraw
beyond
the
oder
and
the
vistula
and
despite
that
you
agree
to
conduct
negotiations
he
paced
silently
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
again
stopped
in
front
of
balashov
his
face
was
as
if
petrified
in
its
stern
expression
and
his
left
leg
trembled
still
more
rapidly
than
before
napoleon
knew
that
he
had
this
trembling
of
the
left
calf
la
vibration
de
mon
mollet
gauche
est
un
grand
signe
chez
moi
he
would
say
later
suggestions
such
as
clearing
the
oder
and
vistula
can
be
made
to
the
prince
of
baden
not
to
me
napoleon
nearly
cried
out
quite
unexpectedly
for
himself
if
you
were
to
give
me
petersburg
and
moscow
i
would
not
accept
these
conditions
you
say
i
started
the
war
and
who
was
the
first
to
join
his
army
the
emperor
alexander
not
i
and
you
offer
me
negotiations
when
ive
spent
millions
while
you
are
in
alliance
with
england
and
when
your
position
is
badyou
offer
me
negotiations
what
is
the
goal
of
your
alliance
with
england
what
has
it
gained
you
he
said
hurriedly
obviously
no
longer
directing
his
speech
at
stating
the
advantages
of
concluding
a
peace
and
discussing
its
possibility
but
only
at
proving
his
rightness
and
his
strength
and
the
wrongs
and
errors
of
alexander
the
introduction
to
his
speech
was
made
obviously
with
the
aim
of
bringing
out
the
advantages
of
his
position
and
showing
that
in
spite
of
that
he
had
accepted
the
opening
of
negotiations
but
he
now
began
to
speak
and
the
more
he
spoke
the
less
able
he
was
to
control
his
speech
the
whole
aim
of
his
speech
now
was
obviously
to
exalt
himself
and
insult
alexander
that
is
to
do
the
thing
he
had
least
wanted
to
do
at
the
beginning
of
the
meeting
they
say
youve
concluded
a
peace
with
the
turks
balashov
inclined
his
head
affirmatively
peace
has
been
concluded
he
began
but
napoleon
did
not
let
him
speak
he
clearly
needed
to
speak
himself
and
he
went
on
to
speak
with
that
eloquence
and
unrestrained
irritation
to
which
spoiled
people
are
so
greatly
inclined
yes
i
know
youve
concluded
a
peace
with
the
turks
without
getting
moldavia
and
wallachia
and
i
would
have
given
your
sovereign
those
provinces
just
as
i
gave
him
finland
yes
he
went
on
i
promised
and
i
would
have
given
the
emperor
alexander
moldavia
and
wallachia
but
now
he
wont
have
those
beautiful
provinces
he
might
however
have
joined
them
to
his
empire
and
within
one
reign
he
would
have
expanded
russia
from
the
gulf
of
bothnia
to
the
mouth
of
the
danube
catherine
the
great
couldnt
have
done
more
napoleon
was
saying
growing
more
and
more
flushed
pacing
the
room
and
repeating
to
balashov
almost
the
same
words
he
had
spoken
to
alexander
himself
at
tilsit
tout
cela
il

d251

mon
amiti233ah
quel

quel

he
repeated
several
times
stopped
took
a
gold
snuffbox
from
his
pocket
and
inhaled
greedily
through
his
nose
quel
beau
r232gne

234tre

alexandre
he
glanced
at
balashov
with
pity
and
just
as
balashov
was
about
to
observe
something
he
again
hastily
interrupted
him
what
could
he
desire
and
seek
that
he
could
not
have
found
in
my
friendship
said
napoleon
with
a
shrug
of
perplexity
no
he
found
it
better
to
surround
himself
with
my
enemiesand
who
are
they
he
went
on
he
summoned
the
steins
the
armfelts

bennigsena
bit
more
of
a
soldier
than
the
others
but
all
the
same
an
incompetent
who
was
unable
to
do
anything
in
1807
and
who
must
call
up
terrible
memories
in
the
emperor
alexander
lets
suppose
if
they
were
competent
they
could
be
made
use
of
napoleon
went
on
barely
able
to
keep
up
verbally
with
the
constantly
emerging
considerations
showing
him
his
rightness
or
power
which
to
his
mind
were
the
same
but
that
is
not
the
case
theyre
no
good
either
for
peace
or
for
war
they
say
barclay
is
more
capable
than
the
rest
but
i
wouldnt
say
so
judging
by
his
first
moves
and
what
are
they
doing
what
are
all
those
courtiers
doing
pfuel

and
barclay
called
upon

know
what
to
decide
on
and
the
time
passes
bagration
alone
is
a
military
man
hes
stupid
but
he
has
experience
a
good
eye
and
determinationand
what
role
does
your
young
sovereign
play
in
that
outrageous
crowd
they
compromise
him
and
shift
onto
him
the
responsibility
for
all
thats
happening
un

he
said
obviously
throwing
these
words
as
a
challenge
into
the
face
of
the
sovereign
napoleon
knew
how
much
alexander
wished
to
be
a
military
commander
its
a
week
since
the
campaign
began
and
you
failed
to
defend
vilno
youre
cut
in
two
and
thrown
out
of
the
polish
provinces
your
army
murmurs
on
the
contrary
your
majesty
said
balashov
barely
managing
to
remember
what
had
been
told
him
and
following
with
difficulty
these
verbal
fireworks
the
troops
are
burning
with
desire
i
know
everything
napoleon
interrupted
him
i
know
everything
and
i
know
the
number
of
your
battalions
as
accurately
as
my
own
you
have
less
than
two
hundred
thousand
men
and
i
have
three
times
that
number
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
said
napoleon
forgetting
that
his
word
of
honor
could
have
no
meaning
i
give
you
ma
parole
dhonneur
que
jai
cinq
cent
trente
mille
hommes
de
ce
cot233
de
la

the
turks
are
no
help
to
you
theyre
good
for
nothing
and
have
proved
it
by
making
peace
with
you
the
swedestheir
destiny
is
to
be
ruled
by
mad
kings
their
king
was
insane
they
changed
him
and
took
another
bernadotte
who
promptly
went
out
of
his
mindbecause
no
swede
who
wasnt
a
madman
would
conclude
alliances
with
russia
napoleon
grinned
spitefully
and
again
put
his
snuffbox
to
his
nose
to
each
of
napoleons
phrases
balashov
could
and
would
have
objected
he
continually
made
the
movement
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
say
something
but
napoleon
interrupted
him
for
instance
about
the
madness
of
the
swedes
balashov
was
about
to
say
that
sweden
was
an
island
when
russia
backed
her
but
napoleon
cried
out
angrily
to
stifle
his
voice
napoleon
was
in
that
state
of
irritation
in
which
a
man
has
to
talk
and
talk
and
talk
only
so
as
to
prove
his
rightness
to
himself
it
was
becoming
oppressive
for
balashov
as
an
envoy
he
was
afraid
of
losing
his
dignity
and
felt
it
necessary
to
object
but
as
a
human
being
he
shrank
morally
before
the
oblivion
of
groundless
wrath
in
which
napoleon
obviously
found
himself
he
knew
that
all
the
words
napoleon
was
now
saying
meant
nothing
that
he
would
be
ashamed
of
them
himself
once
he
came
to
his
senses
balashov
stood
his
eyes
lowered
looking
at
the
movements
of
napoleons
fat
legs
and
tried
to
avoid
his
gaze
what
do
i
care
about
your
allies
said
napoleon
i
have
the
poles
for
allies
there
are
eighty
thousand
of
them
they
fight
like
lions
and
there
will
be
two
hundred
thousand
of
them
and
probably
becoming
still
more
aroused
because
in
saying
that
he
had
said
an
obvious
untruth
and
because
balashov
in
the
same
pose
of
submission
to
his
fate
stood
silently
before
him
he
turned
around
sharply
went
up
very
close
to
balashovs
face
and
making
energetic
and
rapid
gestures
with
his
white
hands
nearly
shouted
know
that
if
you
stir
up
prussia
against
me
know
that
i
will
wipe
her
off
the
map
of
europe
he
said
with
a
pale
face
distorted
by
anger
beating
one
small
hand
against
the
other
with
an
energetic
gesture
yes
ill
hurl
you
back
beyond
the
dvina
beyond
the
dnieper
and
rebuild
that
barrier
against
you
which
europe
was
criminal
and
blind
to
have
allowed
to
be
destroyed
yes
thats
what
will
happen
to
you
thats
what
youve
gained
by
distancing
yourselves
from
me
he
said
and
silently
paced
the
room
several
times
his
fat
shoulders
twitching
he
put
the
snuffbox
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
took
it
out
again
brought
it
to
his
nose
several
times
and
stopped
facing
balashov
he
paused
looking
mockingly
straight
into
balashovs
eyes
and
said
in
a
quiet
voice
et
cependent
quel
beau
r232gne
aurait
pu
avoir
votre
ma238tre
balashov
feeling
it
necessary
to
object
said
that
on
the
russian
side
things
did
not
look
so
gloomy
napoleon
said
nothing
went
on
looking
at
him
mockingly
and
obviously
was
not
listening
to
him
balashov
said
that
in
russia
all
sorts
of
good
things
were
expected
from
the
war
napoleon
nodded
condescendingly
as
if
to
say
i
know
its
your
duty
to
say
so
but
you
dont
believe
it
yourself
i
have
persuaded
you
at
the
end
of
balashovs
speech
napoleon
again
took
out
his
snuffbox
snuffed
from
it
and
gave
a
signal
by
stamping
his
foot
twice
on
the
floor
the
door
opened
a
respectfully
flexing
gentlemaninwaiting
handed
the
emperor
his
hat
and
gloves
another
handed
him
a
handkerchief
napoleon
without
looking
at
them
turned
to
balashov
assure
the
emperor
alexander
on
my
behalf
he
said
taking
his
hat
that
i
am
as
devoted
to
him
as
before
i
know
him
perfectly
and
value
his
lofty
qualities
very
highly
je
ne
vous

and
napoleon
quickly
went
to
the
door
everyone
in
the
reception
room
rushed
forward
and
down
the
stairs
vii
after
all
that
napoleon
had
said
to
him
after
those
outbursts
of
wrath
and
after
those
last
drily
spoken
wordsje
ne
vous

vous

ma
lettrebalashov
was
convinced
that
napoleon
not
only
would
not
wish
to
see
him
but
would
try
not
to
see
himthe
envoy
he
had
insulted
and
moreover
the
witness
to
his
unseemly
vehemence
but
to
his
surprise
balashov
received
that
day
through
duroc
an
invitation
to
the
emperors
table
bessi232res
caulaincourt
and
berthier
were
at
dinner
napoleon
met
balashov
with
a
cheerful
and
benign
air
not
only
was
there
no
expression
in
him
of
embarrassment
or
selfreproach
for
his
mornings
outburst
but
on
the
contrary
he
tried
to
encourage
balashov
clearly
it
was
napoleons
longstanding
conviction
that
the
possibility
of
mistakes
did
not
exist
for
him
and
to
his
mind
everything
he
did
was
good
not
because
it
agreed
with
any
notion
of
what
was
good
and
bad
but
because
he
did
it
the
emperor
was
very
cheerful
after
his
promenade
on
horseback
in
vilno
where
crowds
of
rapturous
people
met
him
and
followed
him
in
all
the
windows
of
the
streets
he
rode
down
carpets
banners
and
his
monogram
were
put
out
and
polish
ladies
greeted
him
waving
their
handkerchiefs
at
dinner
seating
balashov
beside
him
he
treated
him
not
only
benignly
but
as
if
he
counted
balashov
among
his
courtiers
among
the
people
who
sympathized
with
his
plans
and
were
supposed
to
be
glad
of
his
successes
among
other
subjects
he
talked
about
moscow
and
began
to
ask
balashov
about
the
russian
capital
not
merely
as
a
curious
traveler
asks
about
a
new
place
he
intends
to
visit
but
as
if
convinced
that
balashov
as
a
russian
must
be
flattered
by
his
curiosity
how
many
inhabitants
does
moscow
have
how
many
houses
is
it
true
that
moscou
is
called
moscou
la
sainte
how
many
churches
are
there
in
moscou
he
asked
and
to
the
reply
that
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
churches
he
said
why
such
a
profusion
of
churches
the
russians
are
very
pious
answered
balashov
however
a
great
number
of
monasteries
and
churches
is
always
a
sign
of
a
nations
backwardness
said
napoleon
turning
to
caulaincourt
for
an
appreciation
of
this
judgment
balashov
respectfully
allowed
himself
to
disagree
with
the
french
emperors
opinion
each
country
has
its
customs
he
said
but
theres
nothing
like
that
anywhere
in
europe
now
said
napoleon
i
beg
your
majestys
pardon
said
balashov
besides
russia
there
is
also
spain
where
there
are
just
as
many
churches
and
monasteries
this
reply
of
balashovs
alluding
to
the
recent
defeat
of
the
french
in
spain
was
highly
appreciated
later
on
according
to
balashovs
account
at
the
court
of
the
emperor
alexander
but
very
little
appreciated
now
at
napoleons
dinner
and
went
unnoticed
from
the
indifferent
and
puzzled
faces
of
the
gentlemen
marshals
one
could
see
that
they
were
puzzled
by
exactly
what
constituted
the
wittiness
here
which
balashovs
intonation
implied
if
there
was
any
we
didnt
understand
it
or
else
it
wasnt
witty
at
all
said
the
expressions
of
the
marshals
faces
so
little
was
this
reply
appreciated
that
napoleon
even
decidedly
failed
to
notice
it
and
na239vely
asked
balashov
through
what
towns
the
direct
route
from
there
to
moscow
passed
balashov
who
was
on
the
alert
all
through
dinner
replied
that
comme
tout
chemin
m232ne
224
rome
tout
chemin
m232ne
224
moscou
that
there
were
many
roads
and
that
among
those
various
roads
was
the
road
through
poltawa
which
had
been
chosen
by
charles
xii
said
balashov
involuntarily
blushing
with
pleasure
at
the
happy
response
balashov
had
not
managed
to
finish
saying
the
final
word
poltawa
before
caulaincourt
began
talking
about
the
inconvenience
of
the
road
from
petersburg
to
moscow
and
about
his
petersburg
memories
after
dinner
they
went
to
have
coffee
in
napoleons
study
which
four
days
earlier
had
been
the
study
of
the
emperor
alexander
napoleon
sat
down
sipped
his
coffee
from
a
s232vres
cup
and
motioned
balashov
to
the
chair
beside
him
there
exists
in
men
a
certain
afterdinner
state
of
mind
which
more
strongly
than
any
reasonable
causes
makes
a
man
feel
content
with
himself
and
consider
everyone
his
friend
napoleon
was
in
that
state
of
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
surrounded
by
people
who
adored
him
he
was
convinced
that
after
his
dinner
balashov
too
was
his
friend
and
adorer
napoleon
addressed
him
with
a
pleasant
and
slightly
mocking
smile
this
is
the
same
room
ive
been
told
in
which
the
emperor
alexander
lived
strange
isnt
it
general
he
said
obviously
not
doubting
that
this
remark
could
be
anything
but
pleasing
to
his
interlocutor
as
it
proved
his
napoleons
superiority
to
alexander
balashov
could
make
no
reply
to
that
and
silently
bowed
his
head
yes
in
this
room
four
days
ago
wintzingerode
and
stein
conferred
napoleon
went
on
with
the
same
mocking
confident
smile
what
i
cant
understand
he
said
is
that
the
emperor
alexander
made
all
these
personal
enemies
of
mine
his
intimates
that
i
dontunderstand
didnt
he
reflect
that
i
might
do
the
same
he
turned
to
balashov
with
this
question
and
the
recollection
evidently
pushed
him
back
onto
the
track
of
his
mornings
wrath
which
was
still
fresh
in
him
and
let
him
know
that
i
will
do
it
said
napoleon
getting
up
and
shoving
his
cup
away
with
his
hand
ill
throw
all
his
relatives
out
of
germany
all
these
w252rttembergs
badens
weimars
yes
ill
throw
them
out
let
him
prepare
a
refuge
for
them
in
russia
balashov
inclined
his
head
showing
by
his
look
that
he
would
have
liked
to
bow
out
and
was
listening
only
because
he
could
not
help
listening
to
what
was
said
to
him
napoleon
did
not
notice
that
expression
he
addressed
balashov
not
as
his
enemys
envoy
but
as
a
man
who
was
now
entirely
devoted
to
him
and
was
supposed
to
be
glad
of
his
former
masters
humiliation
and
why
has
the
emperor
alexander
taken
charge
of
the
army
what
for
war
is
my
trade
and
his
business
is
to
rule
not
to
command
troops
why
has
he
taken
such
responsibility
upon
himself
napoleon
took
out
his
snuffbox
again
silently
paced
the
room
several
times
and
suddenly
went
up
to
balashov
unexpectedly
and
with
a
slight
smile
as
confidently
quickly
and
simply
as
if
he
was
doing
something
not
only
important
but
pleasant
to
balashov
raised
his
hand
to
the
face
of
the
fortyyearold
russian
general
and
taking
him
by
the
ear
pulled
it
slightly
smiling
with
his
lips
only
avoir
loreille
tir233e
par
lempereur
was
considered
the
greatest
honor
and
favor
at
the
french
court
eh
bien
vous
ne
dites
rien
admirateur
et
courtisan
de
lempereur
alexandre
he
said
as
if
it
was
ridiculous
in
his
presence
to
be
anyone
elses
courtisan
and
admirateur
than
his
napoleons
are
the
horses
ready
for
the
general
he
added
inclining
his
head
slightly
in
response
to
balashovs
bow
give
him
mine
he
has
far
to
go
the
letter
balashov
brought
back
was
napoleons
last
letter
to
alexander
all
the
details
of
the
conversation
were
conveyed
to
the
russian
emperor
and
the
war
began
viii
after
his
meeting
with
pierre
in
moscow
prince
andrei
left
for
petersburg
on
business
as
he
told
his
family
but
in
reality
in
order
to
meet
prince
anatole
kuragin
whom
he
considered
it
necessary
to
meet
kuragin
about
whom
he
made
inquiries
when
he
reached
petersburg
was
no
longer
there
pierre
had
let
his
brotherinlaw
know
that
prince
andrei
was
coming
after
him
anatole
kuragin
at
once
obtained
an
appointment
from
the
minster
of
war
and
left
for
the
army
in
moldavia
at
that
same
time
in
petersburg
prince
andrei
met
kutuzov
his
former
general
who
was
always
welldisposed
towards
him
and
kutuzov
suggested
that
he
go
with
him
to
the
army
in
moldavia
where
the
old
general
had
been
appointed
commander
in
chief
prince
andrei
receiving
an
appointment
to
be
attached
to
general
headquarters
left
for
turkey
prince
andrei
considered
it
improper
to
write
to
kuragin
and
challenge
him
without
giving
him
a
new
pretext
for
a
duel
prince
andrei
considered
that
a
challenge
on
his
compromise
countess
rostov
and
therefore
he
sought
to
meet
kuragin
personally
with
the
intention
of
finding
a
new
pretext
for
a
duel
but
in
the
turkish
army
he
again
failed
to
meet
kuragin
who
returned
to
russia
soon
after
prince
andreis
arrival
in
turkey
in
a
new
country
and
in
new
conditions
prince
andreis
life
became
easier
after
his
fianc233es
betrayal
which
struck
him
the
more
strongly
the
more
he
tried
to
conceal
its
effect
on
him
from
everyone
the
conditions
of
life
in
which
he
had
been
happy
became
a
burden
for
him
and
still
more
of
a
burden
were
the
freedom
and
independence
that
had
once
been
so
dear
to
him
he
not
only
did
not
think
those
former
thoughts
that
had
first
come
to
him
as
he
gazed
at
the
sky
on
the
field
of
austerlitz
which
he
had
liked
to
enlarge
upon
with
pierre
and
which
had
filled
his
solitude
in
bogucharovo
and
then
in
switzerland
and
rome
but
he
was
even
afraid
to
remember
those
thoughts
that
had
opened
boundless
and
bright
horizons
he
was
now
concerned
only
with
the
most
immediate
practical
interests
unconnected
with
his
former
ones
which
he
grasped
at
the
more
eagerly
the
more
closed
to
him
the
former
ones
were
as
if
that
boundless
everreceding
vault
of
the
sky
that
used
to
stand
over
him
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
low
definite
oppressive
vault
in
which
everything
was
clear
and
nothing
was
eternal
or
mysterious
of
the
activities
that
presented
themselves
to
him
military
service
was
the
simplest
and
most
familiar
occupying
the
post
of
general
on
duty
in
kutuzovs
headquarters
he
performed
his
duties
persistently
and
diligently
astonishing
kutuzov
by
his
zeal
for
work
and
his
conscientiousness
not
having
found
kuragin
in
turkey
prince
andrei
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
gallop
back
to
russia
after
him
but
all
the
same
he
knew
that
no
matter
how
much
time
passed
he
could
not
on
meeting
kuragin
despite
all
the
contempt
he
had
for
him
despite
all
the
proofs
he
gave
himself
that
it
was
not
worth
humiliating
himself
by
a
confrontation
with
him
he
knew
that
on
meeting
him
he
could
not
help
challenging
him
as
a
hungry
man
cannot
help
falling
upon
food
and
this
awareness
that
the
insult
had
not
yet
been
avenged
that
the
anger
had
not
yet
been
vented
but
remained
in
his
heart
poisoned
the
artificial
calm
that
prince
andrei
arranged
for
himself
in
turkey
in
the
form
of
a
bustlingly
busy
and
somewhat
ambitious
and
vainglorious
activity
in
the
year
twelve
when
news
of
the
war
with
napoleon
reached
bucharest
where
kutuzov
had
been
staying
for
two
months
spending
the
days
and
nights
with
his
wallachian
woman
prince
andrei
asked
kutuzov
to
transfer
him
to
the
western
army
kutuzov
who
by
then
was
sick
of
bolkonskys
activity
which
served
as
a
reproach
to
his
idleness
quite
willingly
let
him
go
and
gave
him
an
errand
to
barclay
de
tolly
before
going
to
the
army
which
in
may
was
encamped
on
the
drissa
prince
andrei
stopped
at
bald
hills
which
was
directly
on
his
way
being
two
miles
from
the
smolensk
high
road
in
the
last
three
years
of
prince
andreis
life
there
had
been
so
many
upheavals
he
had
thought
felt
and
seen
so
much
having
traveled
both
in
the
west
and
in
the
east
that
on
entering
bald
hills
he
was
strangely
and
unexpectedly
struck
that
everything
was
exactly
the
same
to
the
smallest
detailsthere
was
exactly
the
same
course
of
life
he
rode
down
the
avenue
and
through
the
stone
gates
of
the
bald
hills
house
as
if
into
an
enchanted
sleeping
castle
the
same
staidness
the
same
cleanliness
the
same
silence
were
in
this
house
the
same
furniture
the
same
walls
the
same
sounds
the
same
smell
and
the
same
timid
faces
only
grown
slightly
older
princess
marya
was
the
same
timid
plain
aging
maiden
uselessly
and
joylessly
living
through
the
best
years
of
her
life
in
fear
and
eternal
moral
suffering
mlle
bourienne
was
the
same
coquettish
girl
pleased
with
herself
joyfully
making
use
of
every
moment
of
her
life
and
filled
with
the
most
joyful
hopes
for
herself
she
had
only
become
surer
of
herself
as
it
seemed
to
prince
andrei
the
tutor
dessales
whom
he
had
brought
from
switzerland
was
dressed
in
a
frock
coat
of
russian
cut
spoke
distorted
russian
with
the
servants
but
was
the
same
narrowly
intelligent
welleducated
virtuous
and
pedantic
tutor
the
old
prince
had
changed
physically
only
in
that
a
missing
tooth
could
be
noticed
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
morally
he
was
the
same
as
before
only
with
more
animosity
and
mistrust
towards
the
reality
of
what
was
happening
in
the
world
nikolushka
alone
had
grown
changed
become
redcheeked
with
a
head
of
dark
curly
hair
and
unknowingly
when
he
was
laughing
and
gay
he
raised
the
upper
lip
of
his
pretty
little
mouth
exactly
as
the
deceased
little
princess
used
to
do
he
alone
did
not
obey
the
law
of
changelessness
in
this
enchanted
sleeping
castle
but
though
externally
everything
remained
as
before
the
inner
relations
of
all
these
persons
had
changed
since
prince
andrei
last
saw
them
the
members
of
the
family
were
divided
into
two
camps
alien
and
hostile
to
each
other
which
came
together
now
only
because
of
him
changing
their
usual
way
of
life
for
his
sake
to
one
belonged
the
old
prince
mlle
bourienne
and
the
architect
to
the
other
princess
marya
dessales
nikolushka
and
all
the
nurses
and
nannies
during
his
stay
at
bald
hills
all
the
household
dined
together
but
everyone
felt
awkward
and
prince
andrei
sensed
that
he
was
a
guest
for
whom
an
exception
was
being
made
that
he
inconvenienced
everyone
by
his
presence
during
dinner
on
the
first
day
prince
andrei
involuntarily
sensing
that
was
silent
and
the
old
prince
noticing
the
unnaturalness
of
his
state
also
fell
sullenly
silent
and
went
to
his
room
directly
after
dinner
when
prince
andrei
came
to
him
in
the
evening
and
trying
to
stir
him
up
began
telling
him
about
the
campaign
of
the
young
count
kamensky
the
old
prince
unexpectedly
began
telling
him
about
princess
marya
condemning
her
for
her
superstitiousness
and
for
her
dislike
of
mlle
bourienne
who
according
to
him
was
the
only
one
truly
devoted
to
him
the
old
prince
said
that
if
he
was
ill
it
was
only
because
of
princess
marya
that
she
deliberately
tormented
and
irritated
him
that
she
spoiled
little
prince
nikolai
with
pampering
and
stupid
talk
the
old
prince
knew
very
well
that
he
tormented
his
daughter
that
her
life
was
very
wretched
but
he
also
knew
that
he
could
not
help
tormenting
her
and
that
she
deserved
it
why
does
prince
andrei
who
sees
it
say
nothing
to
me
about
his
sister
the
old
man
wondered
what
does
he
think
im
a
villain
or
an
old
fool
distancing
myself
from
my
daughter
for
no
reason
and
becoming
close
with
the
frenchwoman
he
doesnt
understand
it
and
therefore
i
must
explain
it
to
him
he
must
hear
me
out
thought
the
old
prince
and
he
began
to
explain
the
reasons
why
he
could
not
bear
his
daughters
muddleheaded
character
if
youre
asking
me
said
prince
andrei
without
looking
at
his
father
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
censuring
his
father
i
didnt
want
to
say
it
but
if
youre
asking
me
ill
tell
you
my
frank
opinion
about
it
all
if
there
is
any
misunderstanding
and
discord
between
you
and
masha
i
cant
blame
her
for
iti
know
how
she
loves
and
respects
you
if
youre
asking
me
prince
andrei
went
on
becoming
irritated
because
lately
he
was
always
ready
to
become
irritated
i
can
say
one
thing
if
there
are
misunderstandings
the
cause
of
them
is
a
worthless
woman
who
should
never
have
been
my
sisters
friend
at
first
the
old
man
stared
at
his
son
with
fixed
eyes
and
an
unnatural
smile
that
revealed
his
newly
missing
tooth
which
prince
andrei
could
not
get
used
to
what
friend
my
dear
eh
so
you
had
to
say
it
eh
papa
i
didnt
want
to
judge
prince
andrei
said
in
a
bilious
and
hard
tone
but
you
challenged
me
and
ive
said
and
will
always
say
that
princess
marya
is
not
to
blame
but
the
one
to
blamethe
one
to
blame
is
this
frenchwoman
ah
judgingjudging
the
old
man
said
in
a
low
voice
and
it
seemed
to
prince
andrei
with
embarrassment
but
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
shouted
out
out
dont
leave
a
trace
behind
prince
andrei
wanted
to
leave
at
once
but
princess
marya
persuaded
him
to
stay
for
one
more
day
that
day
prince
andrei
did
not
see
his
father
who
did
not
come
out
and
did
not
let
anyone
in
except
for
mlle
bourienne
and
tikhon
and
asked
several
times
if
his
son
was
gone
the
next
day
before
his
departure
prince
andrei
went
to
his
sons
rooms
the
healthy
boy
curlyheaded
like
his
mother
sat
on
his
lap
prince
andrei
began
telling
him
a
fairy
tale
about
bluebeard
but
did
not
finish
and
fell
to
thinking
he
was
not
thinking
about
this
pretty
boy
his
son
as
he
held
him
on
his
lap
but
about
himself
with
horror
he
sought
and
did
not
find
in
himself
either
remorse
for
having
irritated
his
father
or
regret
at
leaving
him
having
quarreled
with
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
worst
of
all
for
him
was
that
he
sought
and
did
not
find
in
himself
the
former
tenderness
for
his
son
which
he
had
hoped
to
awaken
in
himself
by
caressing
the
boy
and
sitting
him
on
his
lap
well
tell
me
tell
me
said
the
boy
prince
andrei
did
not
answer
him
took
him
off
his
knees
and
left
the
room
as
soon
as
prince
andrei
abandoned
his
everyday
occupations
and
especially
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
former
conditions
of
life
in
which
he
had
lived
when
he
was
still
happy
lifes
anguish
took
hold
of
him
with
its
former
force
and
he
hastened
to
get
away
quickly
from
those
memories
and
quickly
find
something
to
do
so
andr233
youre
definitely
leaving
his
sister
said
to
him
thank
god
i
can
said
prince
andrei
its
too
bad
you
cant
why
do
you
say
that
said
princess
marya
why
do
you
say
that
now
when
youre
going
to
this
terrible
war
and
hes
so
old
mlle
bourienne
said
he
asked
about
you
as
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
of
it
her
lips
trembled
and
tears
began
to
fall
prince
andrei
turned
away
from
her
and
started
pacing
the
room
ah
my
god
my
god
he
said
and
to
think
of
whoof
what
nonentitiescan
be
the
cause
of
peoples
unhappiness
he
said
with
a
malice
that
frightened
princess
marya
she
understood
that
in
referring
to
the
people
he
called
nonentities
he
had
in
mind
not
only
mlle
bourienne
who
had
ruined
her
happiness
but
also
the
man
who
had
ruined
his
own
andr233
i
ask
you
one
thing
i
beg
you
she
said
touching
his
elbow
and
looking
at
him
through
the
tears
in
her
shining
eyes
i
understand
you
princess
marya
lowered
her
eyes
dont
think
that
grief
is
caused
by
people
people
are
his
instruments
she
looked
slightly
over
prince
andreis
head
with
that
confident
habitual
look
with
which
one
looks
at
the
place
of
a
familiar
portrait
grief
is
sent
by
him
not
by
people
people
are
his
instruments
theyre
not
to
blame
if
it
seems
to
you
that
someone
is
to
blame
before
you
forget
it
and
forgive
we
have
no
right
to
punish
and
you
will
know
the
happiness
of
forgiveness
if
i
were
a
woman
marie
i
would
be
doing
that
its
a
womans
virtue
but
a
man
must
not
and
cannot
forget
and
forgive
he
said
and
though
he
had
not
thought
of
kuragin
till
that
moment
all
his
unvented
anger
suddenly
rose
in
his
heart
if
princess
marya
is
now
persuading
me
to
forgive
him
it
means
i
ought
to
have
punished
him
long
ago
he
thought
and
no
longer
responding
to
princess
marya
he
began
thinking
of
that
joyful
spiteful
moment
when
he
would
meet
kuragin
who
as
he
knew
was
with
the
army
princess
marya
begged
her
brother
to
wait
one
more
day
she
said
she
knew
how
unhappy
their
father
would
be
if
andrei
left
without
making
peace
with
him
but
prince
andrei
replied
that
he
would
probably
come
back
soon
from
the
army
that
he
would
be
sure
to
write
to
their
father
and
that
the
longer
he
stayed
now
the
more
aggravated
the
discord
would
be
adieu

were
the
last
words
he
heard
from
his
sister
as
he
was
taking
leave
of
her
so
it
must
be
thought
prince
andrei
as
he
was
driving
out
of
the
avenue
of
the
house
at

hills
she
a
pathetic
innocent

be

order

give
him
an
occasion
to
kill
me
and
laugh
at
me
before
too
there
had
been
the
same
conditions
of
life
but
before
they
had
all
cohered
while
now
everything
had
fallen
apart
nothing
but
meaningless
phenomena
without
any
connection
with
each
other
presented
themselves
to
prince
andrei
one
after
the
other
ix
prince
andrei
arrived
in
the
general
headquarters
of
the
army
at
the
end
of
june
the
troops
of
the
first
army
whom
the
emperor
was
with
were
stationed
in
a
fortified
camp
on
the
drissa
the
troops
of
the
second
army
were
in
retreat
with
the
aim
of
joining
the
first
army
from
which
it
was
said
they
were
cut
off
by
large
forces
of
the
french
everyone
was
displeased
with
the
general
course
of
military
affairs
in
the
russian
army
but
of
the
danger
of
an
invasion
of
the
russian
provinces
no
one
even
thought
no
one
even
supposed
that
the
war
would
be
carried
further
than
the
western
polish
provinces
prince
andrei
found
barclay
de
tolly
to
whom
he
had
been
assigned
on
the
bank
of
the
drissa
as
there
was
not
a
single
large
village
or
settlement
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
all
the
huge
number
of
generals
and
courtiers
who
were
with
the
army
settled
within
a
radius
of
seven
miles
in
the
best
houses
of
the
hamlets
on
this
and
the
other
side
of
the
river
barclay
de
tolly
was
staying
some
three
miles
from
the
sovereign
he
received
bolkonsky
drily
and
coldly
and
said
with
his
german
accent
that
he
would
report
his
arrival
to
the
sovereign
so
as
to
determine
an
assignment
for
him
and
meanwhile
he
invited
him
to
stay
with
his
staff
anatole
kuragin
whom
prince
andrei
had
hoped
to
find
with
the
army
was
not
there
he
was
in
petersburg
and
that
news
pleased
bolkonsky
prince
andrei
was
taken
up
by
the
interest
of
being
at
the
center
of
a
huge
ongoing
war
and
he
was
glad
to
be
free
for
a
time
of
the
vexation
produced
in
him
by
the
thought
of
kuragin
in
the
course
of
the
first
four
days
during
which
he
was
not
called
for
anywhere
prince
andrei
rode
around
the
entire
fortified
camp
and
with
the
help
of
his
knowledge
and
of
conversations
with
wellinformed
people
tried
to
form
some
idea
of
it
for
himself
but
the
question
of
whether
this
camp
was
advantageous
or
not
remained
unresolved
for
prince
andrei
he
had
already
managed
to
draw
from
his
military
experience
the
conviction
that
in
military
matters
the
most
profoundly
devised
plans
meant
nothing
as
he
had
seen
in
the
austerlitz
campaign
that
everything
depended
on
how
one
responded
to
the
unexpected
and
unpredictable
actions
of
the
enemy
that
everything
depended
on
how
and
by
whom
the
action
was
conducted
to
clarify
this
last
question
for
himself
prince
andrei
using
his
position
and
acquaintances
tried
to
penetrate
the
character
of
the
armys
administration
of
the
persons
and
parties
participating
in
it
and
arrived
at
the
following
idea
about
the
state
of
affairs
while
the
sovereign
was
still
in
vilno
the
army
was
divided
in
three
the
first
army
was
under
the
command
of
barclay
de
tolly
the
second
under
the
command
of
bagration
the
third
under
the
command
of
tormasov
the
sovereign
was
with
the
first
army
but
not
as
commander
in
chief
it
was
not
stated
in
the
orders
that
the
sovereign
would
command
but
only
that
the
sovereign
would
be
present
in
the
army
besides
that
the
sovereign
personally
did
not
have
a
commander
in
chiefs
staff
with
him
but
the
staff
of
the
imperial
headquarters
with
him
were
the
chief
of
the
imperial
staff
the
quartermaster
general
prince
volkonsky
generals
imperial
adjutants
diplomatic
officials
and
a
large
number
of
foreigners
but
there
was
no
army
staff
besides
them
the
following
persons
were
with
the
sovereign
without
any
specific
function
arakcheev
the
former
minister
of
war
count
bennigsen
the
highest
ranking
of
the
generals
the
grand
duke
tsarevich
konstantin
pavlovich
count
rumyantsev
the
chancellor
stein
a
former
prussian
minister
armfelt
a
swedish
general
pfuel
the
chief
author
of
the
plan
of
campaign
the
adjutant
general
paulucci
a
native
of
sardinia
wolzogen
and
many
others
though
these
people
were
with
the
army
without
any
military
function
they
had
influence
through
their
position
and
often
a
corps
commander
and
even
the
commander
in
chief
did
not
know
in
what
capacity
bennigsen
or
the
grand
duke
or
arakcheev
or
prince
volkonsky
asked
or
advised
one
thing
or
another
and
did
not
know
whether
it
was
from
his
own
person
or
from
the
sovereign
that
this
or
that
order
in
the
form
of
advice
proceeded
and
whether
or
not
it
was
necessary
to
carry
it
out
but
these
were
externals
while
the
essential
meaning
of
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
and
of
all
these
personsfrom
the
court
point
of
view
and
in
the
sovereigns
presence
everyone
becomes
a
courtierwas
clear
to
everyone
it
was
the
following
the
sovereign
did
not
take
upon
himself
the
title
of
commander
in
chief
but
he
gave
orders
to
all
the
armies
the
people
of
his
entourage
were
his
assistants
arakcheev
was
the
faithful
executorprotector
of
order
and
the
sovereigns
bodyguard
bennigsen
was
a
landowner
of
vilno
province
who
was
as
if
doing
les
honneurs
for
the
province
but
in
reality
was
a
good
general
useful
for
his
advice
and
for
always
being
at
hand
to
replace
barclay
the
grand
duke
was
there
because
such
was
his
pleasure
the
exminister
stein
was
there
because
he
was
useful
for
his
advice
and
because
the
emperor
alexander
valued
his
personal
qualities
highly
armfelt
was
a
vicious
hater
of
napoleon
and
a
selfassured
general
which
always
had
an
effect
on
alexander
paulucci
was
there
because
he
was
bold
and
resolute
in
his
speech
the
adjutant
generals
were
there
because
they
were
wherever
the
sovereign
was
and
finallyabove
allpfuel
was
there
because
having
drawn
up
the
plan
of
war
against
napoleon
and
having
made
alexander
believe
in
the
advisability
of
this
plan
he
was
directing
the
whole
business
of
the
war
pfuel
had
come
with
wolzogen
who
conveyed
pfuels
thoughts
in
a
form
more
accessible
than
did
pfuel
himself
a
closet
theoretician
abrupt
and
selfconfident
to
the
point
of
despising
everything
besides
the
persons
listed
russians
and
foreigners
especially
the
foreigners
who
with
the
boldness
characteristic
of
people
acting
in
an
alien
milieu
suggested
new
unexpected
ideas
every
day
there
were
also
many
secondary
persons
who
were
with
the
army
because
their
superiors
were
there
among
all
the
ideas
and
voices
in
this
immense
restless
brilliant
and
proud
world
prince
andrei
saw
the
following
more
sharply
distinguished
tendencies
and
parties
the
first
party
was
pfuel
and
his
followers
military
theorists
who
believed
that
there
was
a
science
of
war
and
that
in
this
science
there
were
immutable
lawsthe
laws
of
the
oblique
movement
of
outflanking
and
so
on
pfuel
and
his
followers
called
for
retreat
into
the
depths
of
the
country
a
retreat
according
to
precise
laws
set
down
by
the
imaginary
theory
of
war
and
saw
in
every
departure
from
that
theory
only
barbarism
ignorance
or
ill
will
to
this
party
belonged
the
german
princes
wolzogen
wintzingerode
and
others
predominantly
germans
the
second
party
was
the
opposite
of
the
first
as
always
happens
to
one
extreme
corresponded
representatives
of
the
other
extreme
the
people
of
this
party
were
those
who
ever
since
vilno
had
been
calling
for
an
advance
into
poland
and
freedom
from
all
previously
made
plans
along
with
being
representatives
of
bold
action
the
people
of
this
party
were
at
the
same
time
representatives
of
nationalism
which
made
them
still
more
onesided
in
dispute
these
were
russians
bagration
ermolov
who
was
at
the
beginning
of
his
rise
and
others
at
that
time
a
wellknown
joke
of
ermolovs
was
spread
that
he
had
supposedly
asked
the
sovereign
for
just
one
favorto
promote
him
to
german
the
people
of
this
party
said
recalling
suvorov
that
there
was
a
need
not
to
think
not
to
stick
pins
in
the
map
but
to
fight
to
beat
the
enemy
not
to
let
them
into
russia
and
not
to
let
the
troops
lose
heart
to
the
third
party
which
the
sovereign
trusted
most
of
all
belonged
the
courtiers
who
made
little
deals
between
these
two
tendencies
the
people
of
this
party
for
the
most
and
to
whom
arakcheev
belonged
thought
and
said
what
people
usually
say
who
have
no
convictions
but
wish
to
seem
as
if
they
do
they
said
that
war
especially
with
such
a
genius
as
bonaparte
he
was
again
known
as
bonaparte
undoubtedly
called
for
the
most
profoundly
pondered
considerations
for
a
profound
knowledge
of
science
and
in
this
matter
pfuel
was
a
genius
but
along
with
that
one
could
not
help
admitting
that
theorists
are
often
onesided
and
therefore
one
must
not
fully
trust
them
one
must
lend
an
ear
to
what
pfuels
opponents
and
practical
people
experienced
in
military
affairs
have
to
say
and
choose
a
middle
course
the
people
of
this
party
insisted
on
holding
on
to
the
drissa
camp
according
to
pfuels
plan
while
changing
the
movements
of
the
other
armies
though
this
course
of
action
attained
neither
one
goal
nor
the
other
to
the
people
of
this
party
it
seemed
better
that
way
the
fourth
tendency
was
the
tendency
of
which
the
most
conspicuous
representative
was
the
grand
duke
the
heir
to
the
throne
who
was
unable
to
forget
his
disappointment
at
austerlitz
where
as
at
a
review
he
had
ridden
out
at
the
head
of
his
guards
in
a
casque
and
collet
counting
on
boldly
crushing
the
french
and
ending
up
in
the
front
line
had
barely
managed
to
escape
amidst
the
general
confusion
the
people
of
this
party
had
in
their
opinions
both
the
merit
and
the
defect
of
sincerity
they
were
afraid
of
napoleon
saw
strength
in
him
and
weakness
in
themselves
and
said
so
outright
they
said
nothing
will
come
of
it
but
shame
grief
and
ruin
we
abandoned
vilno
we
abandoned
vitebsk
and
we
will
abandon
the
drissa
the
one
intelligent
thing
left
for
us
to
do
is
conclude
a
peace
and
as
soon
as
possible
before
were
driven
out
of
petersburg
this
view
of
things
widely
spread
in
the
higher
spheres
of
the
army
found
support
both
in
petersburg
and
in
the
chancellor
rumyantsev
who
for
other
reasons
of
state
was
also
for
peace
the
fifth
were
adherents
of
barclay
de
tolly
not
so
much
as
a
man
but
as
a
minister
of
war
and
commander
in
chief
they
said
whatever
else
he
may
be
they
always
began
that
way
hes
an
honest
practical
man
and
theres
nobody
better
give
him
real
power
because
war
cannot
proceed
successfully
without
unity
of
command
and
he
will
show
what
he
can
do
as
he
showed
himself
in
finland
if
there
is
order
and
strength
in
our
army
and
it
has
withdrawn
to
drissa
without
suffering
any
losses
we
owe
that
only
to
barclay
if
barclay
is
now
replaced
by
bennigsen
all
will
be
lost
because
bennigsen
already

said
the
people
of
this
party
the
sixth
the
bennigsenists
said
on
the
contrary
that
all
the
same
there
was
no
one
more
practical
and
experienced
than
bennigsen
and
that
however
you
twisted
and
turned
all
the
same
you
would
come
to
him
and
the
people
of
this
party
kept
maintaining
that
our
whole
withdrawal
to
the
drissa
was
a
most
disgraceful
defeat
and
an
unbroken
series
of
errors
the
more
errors
they
make
the
better
they
said
at

theyll
understand
sooner
that
it
cant
go
on
like
this
and
whats
needed
is
not
some
sort
of
barclay
but
a
man
like
bennigsen
who
already
showed
himself
in
1807
who
was
even
given
credit
by
napoleon
himselfa
man
whose
authority
would
be
willingly
recognized

who
were
passionately
devoted
to
the

not
as
an

but
as
a
man
adoring
him
sincerely
and
disinterestedly
as
rostov

adored
him
in

who
saw
in
him
not

all

qualities
these
persons
while
admiring
the
modesty
of
the
sovereign
in
refusing
to
take
command
of
the
army
also
disapproved
of
this
excessive
modesty
and
wished
for
and
insisted
upon
only
one
thing
that
the
adored
sovereign
abandoning
his
excessive
distrust
of
himself
would
openly
announce
that
he
was
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
the
army
would
assemble
around
him
the
headquarters
of
a
commander
in

and
asking
advice
whenever
necessary
from

practicians

enormous
that
it
outnumbered

of
people
who
desired
neither
peace
nor

neither
an
offensive

nor
a
defensive
camp
in
drissa
or
wherever
it
might
be
neither
barclay
nor
the

neither

nor
bennigsen

who
desired
only
one
thing
and
that
the
most

the
greatest

and
pleasure
for
themselves
in
those
muddy
waters
of
crisscrossing
and
entangled

swirled
about

could

wishing

to

on
to
his
advantageous
position
agreed
with
pfuel
today
with
his
adversary
tomorrow
and
two
days
later
maintained
that
he
had
no
opinion
on
the
subject
only
so
as
to
avoid
responsibility
and
please
the
sovereign
another
in
his
wish
to
gain
some
advantage
drew
the
sovereigns
attention
to
himself
loudly
repeating
what
the
sovereign
had
alluded
to
the
day
before
arguing
and
shouting
at
the
council
beating
his
breast
and
challenging
those
who
disagreed
to
a
duel
thus
demonstrating
that
he
was
prepared
to
be
a
victim
for
the
common
good
a
third
between
two
councils
and
in
the
absence
of
his
enemies
simply
solicited
a
reward
for
his
faithful
service
knowing
that
there
would
be
no
time
to
bother
with
a
refusal
a
fourth
kept
trying
to
catch
the
sovereigns
eye

by
chance
as
one
burdened
by
his
labors
a
fifth
in

to
achieve
a

goaldinner
with
the

insisted
on
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
a
newly
emerged
opinion
and
to
that
end
put
forth
more
or
less
forceful
and
correct
arguments
all
the
people
in
this
party
were
pursuing
roubles
crosses
ranks
and
in
this
pursuit
merely
followed
where
the
weathervane
of
the
tsars
favor
pointed
and
as
soon
as
they
noticed
the
weathervane
turning
in
a
certain
direction
all
this
drone
population
of
the
army
began
to
blow
in
the
same
direction
so
that
it
was
harder
for
the
sovereign
to
change
it
for
another
amidst
the
uncertainty
of
the
situation
with
the
threat
of
serious
danger
which
gave
everything
an
especially
disquieting
character
amidst
this
whirlwind
of
intrigues
vanities
clashes
of
various
views
and
feelings
with
all
these
people
of
different
tribes
this
eighth
and
largest
party
of
people
concerned
only
with
personal
interests
brought
great
confusion
and
perplexity
to
the
common
cause
whatever
question
arose
this
swarm
of
drones
not
yet
done
humming
over
the
previous
topic
flew
on
to
the
new
one
and
their
buzzing
drowned
out
and
obscured
the
sincerely
disputing
voices
from
all
these
parties
one
more
the
ninth
party
emerged
and
began
to
raise
its
voice
just
as
prince
andrei
came
to
the
army
this
was
a
party
of
older
people
intelligent
experienced
in
statesmanship
and
who
were
able
without
sharing
any
of
these
contradictory
opinions
to
look
at
everything
that
went
on
at
headquarters
abstractly
and
to
reflect
on
the
means
of
getting
out
of
this
uncertainty
irresolution
confusion
and
weakness
the
people
of
this
party
said
and
thought
that
all
the
harm
came
primarily
from
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
and
his
military
court
in
the
army
that
it
brought
into
the
army
that
indefinite
conditional
and
fluctuating
instability
of
relations
which
was
suitable
to
the
court
but
bad
for
the
army
that
the
sovereign
ought
to
rule
and
not
command
troops
that
the
only
way
out
of
this
situation
was
the
departure
of
the
sovereign
and
his
court
from
the
army
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
sovereign
paralyzed
the
fifty
thousand
troops
needed
to
ensure
his
personal
safety
that
the
very
worst
but
independent
commander
in
chief
would
be
better
than
the
very
best
but
bound
by
the
presence
and
authority
of
the
sovereign
at
the
time
when
prince
andrei
was
living
unoccupied
on
the
drissa
shishkov
the
secretary
of
state
who
was
one
of
the
chief
representatives
of
this
party
wrote
a
letter
to
the
sovereign
which
balashov
and
arakcheev
agreed
to
sign
in
this
letter
taking
advantage
of
the
permission
granted
him
by
the
sovereign
to
discuss
the
general
course
of
affairs
he
respectfully
suggested
that
the
sovereign
leave
the
army
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
inspire
the
people
of
the
capital
for
war
the
sovereigns
inspiring
of
the
people
and
calling
them
to
the
defense
of
the
fatherlandthat
very
inspiring
of
the
people
insofar
as
it
was
produced
by
the
sovereigns
presence
in
moscow
which
was
the
chief
cause
of
russias
triumphwas
presented
to
and
accepted
by
the
sovereign
as
a
pretext
for
leaving
the
army
x
this
letter
had
not
yet
been
given
to
the
sovereign
when
barclay
told
bolkonsky
at
dinner
that
the
sovereign
would
like
to
see
prince
andrei
in
person
in
order
to
question
him
about
turkey
and
that
prince
andrei
was
to
go
to
bennigsens
quarters
at
six
oclock
in
the
evening
on
that
same
day
information
was
received
in
the
sovereigns
quarters
about
new
movements
of
napoleon
that
might
prove
dangerous
to
the
armyinformation
which
subsequently
proved
incorrect
and
that
same
morning
colonel
michaud
making
the
round
of
the
drissa
fortifications
with
the
sovereign
tried
to
persuade
the
sovereign
that
this
fortified
camp
set
up
by
pfuel
which
till
then
had
been
considered
a
tactical
chefdoeuvre
that
would
be
the
destruction
of
napoleonthat
this
camp
was
absurd
and
would
be
the
destruction
of
the
russian
army
prince
andrei
arrived
at
the
quarters
of
general
bennigsen
who
occupied
a
small
manor
house
right
on
the
bank
of
the
river
neither
bennigsen
nor
the
sovereign
was
there
but
chernyshov
the
imperial
adjutant
received
bolkonsky
and
announced
to
him
that
the
sovereign
had
ridden
with
general
bennigsen
and
marquis
paulucci
to
make
a
second
round
of
the
fortifications
of
the
drissa
camp
the
suitability
of
which
had
become
a
subject
of
strong
doubts
chernyshov
was
sitting
with
a
french
novel
by
a
window
in
the
first
room
this
room
was
probably
once
the
reception
room
an
organ
still
stood
there
with
some
sort
of
rugs
piled
on
it
and
in
one
corner
stood
the
camp
bed
of
bennigsens
adjutant
this
adjutant
was
there
he
sat
on
the
rolledup
bedding
and
dozed
evidently
worn
out
by
carousing
or
work
there
were
two
doors
in
the
reception
room
one
led
straight
to
the
former
drawing
room
the
other
to
the
study
on
the
right
from
the
first
door
came
the
sound
of
voices
talking
in
german
and
occasionally
in
french
there
in
the
former
drawing
room
were
assembled
at
the
sovereigns
wish
not
a
council
of
war
the
sovereign
liked
indefiniteness
but
some
persons
whose
opinion
about
the
forthcoming
difficulties
he
wished
to
know
it
was
not
a
council
of
war
but
as
it
were
a
council
of
some
people
chosen
to
clarify
certain
questions
personally
for
the
sovereign
to
this
semicouncil
there
had
been
invited
the
swedish
general
armfelt
the
adjutant
general
wolzogen
wintzingerode
whom
napoleon
had
called
a
fugitive
french
subject
michaud
toll
count
stein
who
was
not
a
military
man
at
all
and
finally
pfuel
himself
who
as
prince
andrei
had
heard
was
the
cheville
ouvri232re
of
the
whole
thing
prince
andrei
chanced
to
have
a
good
look
at
him
because
pfuel
arrived
soon
after
he
did
and
went
to
the
drawing
room
after
stopping
for
a
moment
to
talk
with
chernyshov
at
first
glance
pfuel
in
his
poorly
cut
russian
generals
uniform
which
sat
awkwardly
on
him
like
a
mummers
costume
seemed
familiar
to
prince
andrei
though
he
had
never
seen
him
there
was
in
him
something
of
weyrother
and
of
mack
and
of
schmidt
and
of
many
other
german
theoristgenerals
whom
prince
andrei
had
managed
to
see
in
1805
but
he
was
the
most
typical
of
them
all
such
a
german
theorist
who
combined
in
himself
all
that
there
was
in
those
other
germans
prince
andrei
had
never
seen
before
pfuel
was
of
small
stature
very
thin
but
broadboned
of
coarse
robust
build
with
broad
hips
and
sharp
shoulder
blades
his
face
was
very
wrinkled
his
eyes
deepset
his
hair
in
front
at
the
temples
had
obviously
been
hastily
slicked
down
with
a
brush
but
in
back
it
stuck
up
na239vely
in
little
tufts
he
came
into
the
room
looking
around
uneasily
and
angrily
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
everything
in
that
big
room
he
had
come
into
keeping
a
hand
awkwardly
on
his
sword
he
addressed
chernyshov
asking
in
german
where
the
sovereign
was
he
clearly
wanted
to
go
inside
as
quickly
as
possible
have
done
with
the
bowings
and
greetings
and
get
down
to
work
on
the
map
where
he
felt
he
belonged
he
hastily
nodded
his
head
to
chernyshovs
words
and
smiled
ironically
listening
to
him
say
that
the
sovereign
was
inspecting
the
fortifications
which
he
pfuel
himself
had
laid
out
according
to
his
theory
he
grumbled
something
to
himself
in
a
tough
bass
voice
the
way
selfassured
germans
speak
dummkopf
or
zu

die
ganze

prince
andrei
did
not
quite
hear
and
would
have
passed
by
but
chernyshov
introduced
him
to
pfuel
observing
that
prince
andrei
had
come
from
turkey
where
the
war
had
ended
so
fortunately
pfuel
barely
glanced
not
so
much
at
as
through
prince
andrei
and
said
laughing
da
muss
ein
sch246ner
taktischer
krieg
gewesen
sein
and
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
he
walked
into
the
room
in
which
the
voices
were
heard
clearly
pfuel
always
ready
for
ironic
irritation
anyway
was
especially
upset
that
day
that
they
had
dared
to
inspect
and
criticize
his
camp
without
him
from
this
one
brief
encounter
with
pfuel
prince
andrei
owing
to
his
memories
of
austerlitz
formed
a
clear
notion
of
the
mans
character
for
himself
pfuel
was
one
of
those
hopelessly
permanently
painfully
selfassured
men
as
only
germans
can
be
and
precisely
because
only
germans
can
be
selfassured
on
the
basis
of
an
abstract
ideascience
that
is
an
imaginary
knowledge
of
the
perfect
truth
a
frenchman
is
selfassured
because
he
considers
himself
personally
in
mind
as
well
as
body
irresistibly
enchanting
for
men
as
well
as
women
an
englishman
is
selfassured
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
bestorganized
state
in
the
world
and
therefore
as
an
englishman
he
always
knows
what
he
must
do
and
knows
that
everything
he
does
as
an
englishman
is
unquestionably
good
an
italian
is
selfassured
because
he
is
excitable
and
easily
forgets
himself
and
others
a
russian
is
selfassured
precisely
because
he
does
not
know
anything
and
does
not
want
to
know
anything
because
he
does
not
believe
it
possible
to
know
anything
fully
a
german
is
selfassured
worst
of
all
and
most
firmly
of
all
and
most
disgustingly
of
all
because
he
imagines
that
he
knows
the
truth
science
which
he
has
invented
himself
but
which
for
him
is
the
absolute
truth
such
obviously
was
pfuel
he
had
sciencethe
theory
of
the
oblique
movement
which
he
deduced
from
the
history
of
the
wars
of
frederick
the
greatand
everything
he
came
across
in
contemporary
military
history
seemed
to
him
senselessness
barbarism
grotesque
clashes
in
which
so
many
mistakes
were
made
on
both
sides
that
these
wars
could
not
be
called
wars
they
did
not
fit
the
theory
and
could
not
serve
as
material
for
science
in
1806
pfuel
had
been
one
of
the
architects
of
the
plan
of
war
that
had
ended
with
jena
and
auerst228dt
but
he
did
not
see
in
the
outcome
of
that
war
the
least
proof
of
the
incorrectness
of
his
theory
on
the
contrary
to
his
mind
the
departures
from
his
theory
were
the
only
cause
of
the
whole
failure
and
he
with
a
gleeful
irony
all
his
own
used
to
say
ich
sagte
ja
dass
die
ganze
geschichte
zum
teufel
gehen
wird
pfuel
was
one
of
those
theorists
who
so
love
their
theory
that
they
forget
the
purpose
of
the
theoryits
application
in
practice
in
his
love
for
theory
he
hated
everything
practical
and
did
not
want
to
know
about
it
he
was
even
glad
of
failure
because
failure
proceeding
from
departures
from
theory
in
practice
only
proved
to
him
the
correctness
of
his
theory
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
prince
andrei
and
chernyshov
about
the
present
war
with
the
expression
of
a
man
who
knows
beforehand
that
it
will
all
go
badly
and
who
is
not
even
displeased
by
that
the
unbrushed
tufts
of
hair
on
his
nape
and
his
hastily
slicked
down
sidewhiskers
were
the
most
eloquent
confirmation
of
it
he
went
into
the
other
room
and
at
once
from
there
came
the
grumbling
sounds
of
his
bass
voice
xi
prince
andrei
was
still
following
pfuel
with
his
eyes
when
count
bennigsen
hurriedly
came
into
the
room
and
nodding
to
bolkonsky
without
pausing
went
to
the
study
giving
some
orders
to
his
adjutant
the
sovereign
was
coming
behind
him
and
bennigsen
had
hurried
ahead
so
as
to
prepare
things
and
have
time
to
meet
the
sovereign
chernyshov
and
prince
andrei
went
out
to
the
porch
the
sovereign
with
a
weary
look
was
getting
off
his
horse
marquis
paulucci
was
telling
him
something
the
sovereign
his
head
inclined
to
the
left
listened
with
a
displeased
air
to
paulucci
who
was
speaking
with
particular
vehemence
the
sovereign
started
on
apparently
wishing
to
finish
the
conversation
but
the
flushed
excited
italian
forgetting
propriety
walked
after
him
still
speaking
quant

celui

paulucci
was
saying
at
the
moment
when
the
sovereign
going
up
the
steps
and
noticing
prince
andrei
began
peering
at
the
unfamiliar
face
quant

not
hearing
out
and
as

listening
to

words
the
sovereign
having
recognized
bolkonsky
graciously
addressed
him
very
glad
to
see
you
go
in
where
theyve
assembled
and
wait
for
me
the
sovereign
went
to
the
study
he
was
followed
by
prince
pyotr
mikhailovich
volkonsky
and
baron
stein
and
the
doors
closed
behind
them
prince
andrei
taking
advantage
of
the
sovereigns
permission
went
along
with
paulucci
whom
he
had
known
in
turkey
into
the
drawing
room
where
the
council
was
assembled
prince
pyotr
mikhailovich
volkonsky
occupied
a
post
as
something
like
the
sovereigns
chief
of
staff
volkonsky
came
out
of
the
study
and
bringing
maps
to
the
drawing
room
and
spreading
them
on
the
table
told
the
assembled
gentlemen
the
questions
on
which
he
would
like
to
hear
their
opinion
the
thing
was
that
during
the
night
information
had
been
received
subsequently
proved
false
that
the
french
were
moving
to
outflank
the
drissa
camp
the
first
to
begin
speaking
was
general
armfelt
who
to
get
around
the
difficulty
presented
unexpectedly
suggested
a
new
position
totally
inexplicable
except
by
his
wish
to
show
that
he
too
could
have
an
opinion
away
from
the
petersburg
and
moscow
roads
at
which
in
his
opinion
the
united
army
should
await
the
enemy
it
was
clear
that
this
plan
had
been
put
together
by
armfelt
long
ago
and
he
was
now
expounding
it
not
so
much
with
the
purpose
of
answering
the
questions
posed
which
this
plan
did
not
answer
as
with
the
purpose
of
using
the
opportunity
to
speak
about
it
it
was
one
of
the
millions
of
suggestions
that
could
be
made
as
wellfounded
as
any
other
if
one
had
no
notion
of
what
character
the
war
would
take
some
argued
against
his
opinion
some
defended
it
the
young
colonel
toll
argued
against
the
swedish
generals
opinion
more
vehemently
than
the
others
and
during
the
argument
took
from
his
side
pocket
a
notebook
full
of
writing
which
he
asked
permission
to
read
in
an
extensively
composed
project
toll
suggested
another
plan
of
campaignthe
complete
opposite
of
armfelts
plan
and
pfuels
plan
paulucci
objecting
to
toll
suggested
a
plan
of
advance
and
attack
which
alone
he
said
could
take
us
out
of
the
uncertainty
and
the
trap
as
he
called
the
drissa
camp
in
which
we
found
ourselves
during
this
argument
pfuel
and
his
translator
wolzogen
his
bridge
in
court
relations
were
silent
pfuel
merely
snorted
scornfully
and
looked
away
showing
that
he
would
never
lower
himself
to
objecting
to
the
nonsense
he
was
listening
to
but
when
prince
volkonsky
who
was
leading
the
debate
called
on
him
to
express
his
opinion
he
merely
said
why
ask
me
general
armfelt
has
suggested
a
beautiful
position
with
an
exposed
rear
or
the
attack
von
diesem
italienischen
herrn
sehr
sch246n
or
a
retreat
auch
gut
why
ask
me
he
said
you
yourselves
know
everything
better
than
i
but
when
volkonsky
frowning
said
that
he
was
asking
his
opinion
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign
pfuel
stood
up
and
suddenly
animated
began
to
speak
you
have
ruined
everything
confused
everything
wanted
to
know
everything
better
than
i
and
now
you
come
to
me
how
can
we
fix
it
theres
nothing
to
fix
everything
should
be
carried
out
precisely
according
to
the
foundations
i
have
laid
down
he
said
rapping
his
bony
knuckles
on
the
table
what
is
the
difficulty
nonsense
kinderspiel
he
went
up
to
the
map
and
started
speaking
quickly
jabbing
his
dry
finger
at
the
map
and
insisting
that
no
chance
could
alter
the
expediency
of
the
drissa
camp
that
everything
had
been
foreseen
and
that
if
the
enemy
should
indeed
outflank
it
they
would
inevitably
be
destroyed
paulucci
who
did
not
know
german
started
asking
questions
in
french
wolzogen
came
to
the
aid
of
his
principal
who
spoke
french
poorly
and
started
translating
his
words
barely
keeping
up
with
pfuel
who
rapidly
proved
that
not
only
everything
that
had
happened
but
everything
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
in
his
plan
and
that
if
there
were
difficulties
now
the
whole
blame
lay
only
in
the
fact
that
everything
had
not
been
carried
out
precisely
he
kept
laughing
ironically
demonstrated
and
at
last
contemptuously
stopped
demonstrating
as
a
mathematician
stops
checking
in
various
ways
the
onceproven
correctness
of
a
problem
wolzogen
replaced
him
continuing
to
set
forth
his
thoughts
in
french
and
saying
to
pfuel
every
now
and
then
nicht
wahr
exellenz
pfuel
like
a
man
who
in
the
heat
of
battle
strikes
his
own
side
shouted
angrily
at
wolzogen
as
well
nun
ja
was
soll
denn
da
noch
expliziert
werden
paulucci
and
michaud
with
two
voices
fell
upon
wolzogen
in
french
armfelt
addressed
pfuel
in
german
toll
explained
something
to
volkonsky
in
russian
prince
andrei
silently
listened
and
observed
of
all
these
persons
the
one
who
most
awakened
prince
andreis
sympathy
was
the
embittered
resolute
and
senselessly
selfassured
pfuel
he
alone
of
all
the
persons
present
there
obviously
desired
nothing
for
himself
felt
no
enmity
against
anyone
and
desired
only
one
thing
the
putting
into
action
of
a
plan
worked
out
according
to
a
theory
arrived
at
through
years
of
labor
he
was
ridiculous
he
was
unpleasant
in
his
irony
but
at
the
same
time
he
inspired
an
involuntary
respect
by
his
boundless
devotion
to
his
idea
besides
that
in
all
the
speeches
of
all
the
speakers
with
the
exception
of
pfuel
there
was
one
common
feature
which
had
not
been
there
at
the
council
of
war
in
1805
there
was
now
however
concealed
a
panic
fear
before
the
genius
of
napoleon
a
fear
that
voiced
itself
in
every
objection
every
possible
supposition
was
made
with
regard
to
napoleon
he
was
expected
on
all
sides
and
with
his
terrible
name
they
demolished
each
others
suggestions
pfuel
alone
it
seemed
considered
him
napoleon
as
much
a
barbarian
as
all
the
opponents
of
his
theory
but
besides
a
feeling
of
respect
pfuel
inspired
a
feeling
of
pity
in
prince
andrei
from
the
tone
in
which
the
courtiers
addressed
him
from
what
paulucci
had
allowed
himself
to
say
to
the
emperor
but
above
all
from
a
certain
desperation
in
pfuels
own
expressions
it
was
clear
that
the
others
knew
and
he
himself
sensed
that
his
fall
was
near
and
despite
his
selfassurance
and
grumbling
german
irony
he
was
pitiful
with
his
hair
slicked
down
on
his
temples
and
tufts
sticking
out
on
his
nape
though
he
concealed
it
behind
an
appearance
of
irritation
and
contempt
he
was
clearly
in
despair
because
the
sole
remaining
opportunity
of
making
an
enormous
experiment
and
proving
the
correctness
of
his
theory
to
the
whole
world
was
slipping
away
from
him
the
debate
went
on
for
a
long
time
and
the
longer
it
went
on
the
more
heated
the
argument
became
reaching
the
point
of
shouting
and
personal
remarks
and
the
less
possible
it
was
to
draw
any
general
conclusion
from
all
that
had
been
said
listening
to
this
multilingual
talk
and
these
suggestions
plans
and
refutations
and
shouts
prince
andrei
was
simply
amazed
at
what
they
all
said
the
thoughts
he
often
used
to
have
long
ago
during
the
time
of
his
military
activity
that
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
any
military
science
and
therefore
there
could
not
be
any
socalled
military
genius
now
acquired
for
him
the
perfect
evidence
of
truth
what
theory
and
what
science
could
there
be
in
a
matter
of
which
the
conditions
and
circumstances
are
unknown
and
cannot
be
determined
in
which
the
strength
of
those
active
in
war
can
still
less
be
determined
no
one
could
or
can
know
what
position
our
own
and
the
enemy
army
will
be
in
a
day
later
and
no
one
can
know
the
strength
of
this
or
that
detachment
sometimes
when
theres
no
coward
at
the
head
who
shouts
were
cut
off
and
runs
away
but
a
cheerful
bold
man
who
shouts
hurraha
detachment
of
five
thousand
is
worth
thirty
thousand
as
at
sch246ngraben
and
sometimes
fifty
thousand
flee
in
the
face
of
eight
as
at
austerlitz
what
science
can
there
be
in
a
matter
in
which
as
in
any
practical
matter
nothing
can
be
determined
and
everything
depends
on
countless
circumstances
the
significance
of
which
is
determined
at
a
certain
moment
and
no
one
knows
when
that
moment
will
come
armfelt
says
our
army
is
cut
off
and
paulucci
says
weve
put
the
french
army
between
two
fires
michaud
says
the
drissa
camp
is
no
good
because
the
river
is
behind
it
and
pfuel
says
its
strength
lies
in
that
toll
suggests
one
plan
armfelt
another
theyre
all
good
and
theyre
all
bad
and
the
advantages
of
any
position
can
become
evident
only
at
the
moment
when
the
event
occurs
and
why
do
they
all
talk
about
military
genius
is
that
man
a
genius
who
manages
to
order
a
timely
delivery
of
biscuits
and
tells
this
one
to
go
right
and
that
one
to
go
left
it
is
only
because
military
men
are
clothed
in
splendor
and
power
and
masses
of
scoundrels
flatter
power
endowing
it
with
qualities
of
genius
it
does
not
have
that
they
are
called
geniuses
on
the
contrary
the
best
generals
i
knew
were
stupid
or
absentminded
people
bagration
was
the
bestnapoleon
himself
recognized
that
and
bonaparte
himself
i
remember
his
selfsatisfied
and
limited
face
on
the
battlefield
at
austerlitz
a
good
commander
not
only
does
not
need
genius
or
any
special
qualities
but
on
the
contrary
he
needs
the
absence
of
the
best
and
highest
human
qualitieslove
poetry
tenderness
a
searching
philosophical
doubt
he
should
be
limited
firmly
convinced
that
what
he
is
doing
is
very
important
otherwise
he
would
not
have
patience
enough
and
only
then
will
he
be
a
brave
commander
god
forbid
he
should
be
a
human
being
and
come
to
love
or
pity
someone
or
start
thinking
about
what
is
just
and
what
isnt
understandably
the
theory
of
genius
was
cut
to
fit
them
of
old
because
they
arepower
the
merit
of
success
in
military
affairs
does
not
depend
on
them
but
on
the
man
in
the
ranks
who
shouts
were
lost
or
shouts
hurrah
and
it
is
only
in
the
ranks
that
one
can
serve
with
the
assurance
of
being
useful
so
thought
prince
andrei
as
he
listened
to
the
debate
and
he
came
to
his
senses
only
when
paulucci
called
him
and
everybody
was
leaving
at
the
review
the
next
day
the
sovereign
asked
prince
andrei
where
he
would
like
to
serve
and
prince
andrei
was
forever
lost
to
the
world
of
the
court
when
he
did
not
ask
to
remain
with
the
person
of
the
sovereign
but
asked
permission
to
serve
in
the
army
xii
before
the
opening
of
the
campaign
rostov
received
a
letter
from
his
parents
in
which
informing
him
briefly
of
natashas
illness
and
her
break
with
prince
andrei
this
break
was
explained
to
him
by
natashas
refusal
they
again
asked
him
to
resign
from
the
service
and
come
home
nikolai
on
receiving
this
letter
did
not
even
attempt
to
ask
for
a
leave
or
resignation
but
wrote
to
his
parents
that
he
was
sorry
about
natashas
illness
and
her
break
with
her
fianc233
and
that
he
would
do
everything
possible
to
fulfill
their
wishes
to
sonya
he
wrote
separately
adored
friend
of
my
soul
nothing
save
honor
could
keep
me
from
returning
to
the
country
but
now
before
the
opening
of
the
campaign
i
would
consider
myself
dishonorable
not
only
before
all
my
comrades
but
also
before
my
own
self
if
i
were
to
prefer
happiness
to
my
duty
and
love
for
the
fatherland
but
this
is
our
last
separation
believe
me
right
after
the
war
if
i
am
alive
and
you
still
love
me
i
will
abandon
everything
and
come
flying
to
you
to
press
you
forever
to
my
ardent
breast
indeed
only
the
opening
of
the
campaign
detained
rostov
and
prevented
him
from
comingas
he
had
promisedand
marrying
sonya
autumn
in
otradnoe
with
its
hunting
and
winter
with
christmastime
and
sonyas
love
had
opened
before
him
the
prospect
of
quiet
gentlemanly
joys
and
a
tranquillity
that
he
had
not
known
before
and
which
now
beckoned
to
him
a
nice
wife
children
a
good
pack
of
hounds
ten
or
twelve
leashes
of
dashing
borzois
husbandry
neighbors
local
elections
he
thought
but
now
there
was
the
campaign
and
he
had
to
stay
in
the
regiment
and
since
it
had
to
be
so
nikolai
rostovs
character
was
such
that
he
was
content
with
the
life
he
led
in
the
regiment
and
managed
to
make
that
life
pleasant
for
himself
on
returning
from
leave
joyfully
welcomed
by
his
comrades
nikolai
had
been
sent
for
a
remount
and
had
brought
excellent
horses
from
little
russia
which
pleased
him
and
earned
him
the
praises
of
his
superiors
during
his
absence
he
had
been
promoted
to
captain
and
when
the
regiment
was
put
on
wartime
status
with
an
increased
complement
he
was
again
given
his
old
squadron
the
campaign
began
the
regiment
was
moved
to
poland
the
pay
was
doubled
new
officers
arrived
new
men
and
horses
and
above
all
that
excitedly
cheerful
mood
spread
around
which
accompanies
the
beginning
of
war
and
rostov
conscious
of
his
advantageous
position
in
the
regiment
gave
himself
up
wholly
to
the
pleasures
and
interests
of
military
service
though
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
leave
them
behind
the
troops
retreated
from
vilno
for
various
complex
governmental
political
and
tactical
reasons
every
step
of
the
retreat
was
accompanied
by
a
complex
play
of
interests
conclusions
and
passions
in
the
general
staff
yet
for
the
hussars
of
the
pavlogradsky
regiment
this
whole
march
in
retreat
during
the
best
period
of
summer
well
provided
with
supplies
was
the
simplest
and
merriest
affair
to
be
despondent
to
worry
to
intrigue
was
possible
at
general
headquarters
but
in
the
depths
of
the
army
no
one
even
asked
himself
where
he
was
going
or
why
if
they
were
sorry
to
be
retreating
it
was
only
because
they
had
to
leave
their
homey
quarters
or
a
pretty
polish
panna
if
it
did
enter
anyones
head
that
things
were
bad
then
as
a
good
military
man
should
the
one
whose
head
it
had
entered
would
try
to
be
cheerful
and
not
think
about
the
general
course
of
things
but
about
the
matters
closest
to
him
first
they
cheerfully
camped
near
vilno
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
polish
landowners
and
waiting
and
performing
reviews
for
the
sovereign
and
other
high
commanders
then
orders
came
to
retreat
to
swienciany
and
destroy
the
provisions
that
could
not
be
taken
along
swienciany
was
memorable
to
the
hussars
only
because
it
was
a
drunken
camp
as
the
whole
army
named
their
stopping
place
there
and
because
there
were
many
complaints
against
the
troops
who
taking
advantage
of
the
order
to
gather
provisions
also
gathered
horses
carriages
and
rugs
from
the
polish
gentry
rostov
remembered
swienciany
because
on
the
first
day
they
entered
this
little
town
he
had
dismissed
his
sergeant
major
and
had
been
unable
to
handle
all
the
drunken
men
of
the
squadron
who
without
his
knowledge
had
got
hold
of
five
barrels
of
old
beer
from
swienciany
they
retreated
further
and
further
towards
the
drissa
then
again
retreated
from
the
drissa
and
were
now
approaching
the
russian
border
on
the
thirteenth
of
july
the
pavlogradskies
were
to
take
serious
action
for
the
first
time
during
the
night
of
the
twelfth
of
june
on
the
eve
of
action
there
was
violent
rain
and
a
thunderstorm
the
summer
of
1812
was
generally
remarkable
for
its
storms
two
of
the
pavlogradsky
squadrons
made
their
bivouac
in
the
middle
of
a
rye
field
already
in
ear
but
totally
trampled
down
by
cattle
and
horses
it
was
pouring
rain
and
rostov
with
the
young
officer
ilyin
whom
he
patronized
was
sitting
under
a
hastily
slappedtogether
leanto
an
officer
of
their
regiment
with
long
mustaches
that
continued
across
his
cheeks
who
was
coming
back
from
the
staff
and
got
caught
by
the
rain
stopped
to
see
rostov
im
coming
from
the
staff
count
have
you
heard
about
raevskys
feat
and
the
officer
recounted
the
details
of
the
battle
of
saltanovo
which
he
had
heard
at
the
staff
rostov
hunching
his
shoulders
as
water
ran
down
his
neck
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
listening
inattentively
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
young
officer
ilyin
who
huddled
up
to
him
this
officer
a
sixteenyearold
boy
who
had
recently
joined
the
regiment
was
now
in
relation
to
nikolai
what
nikolai
had
been
in
relation
to
denisov
seven
years
ago
ilyin
tried
to
imitate
rostov
in
everything
and
was
in
love
with
him
like
a
woman
the
officer
with
the
double
mustaches
zdrzhinsky
was
pompously
telling
about
how
the
saltanovo
dam
was
the
russian
thermopylae
and
that
on
that
dam
general
raevsky
had
performed
a
deed
worthy
of
antiquity
zdrzhinsky
recounted
the
deed
of
raevsky
who
had
led
his
two
sons
onto
the
dam
under
fierce
gunfire
and
had
gone
into
the
attack
alongside
them
rostov
was
listening
to
the
story
and
not
only
said
nothing
to
confirm
zdrzhinskys
raptures
but
on
the
contrary
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
is
ashamed
of
what
he
is
being
told
though
he
has
no
intention
of
objecting
after
the
campaigns
of
austerlitz
and
of
1807
rostov
knew
from
his
own
experience
that
when
telling
about
military
events
people
always
lied
as
he
himself
had
lied
in
telling
about
them
second
he
had
enough
experience
to
know
that
in
war
everything
goes
on
quite
otherwise
than
we
can
imagine
and
recount
and
therefore
he
did
not
like
zdrzhinskys
story
and
did
not
like
zdrzhinsky
himself
who
with
his
mustaches
growing
across
his
cheeks
had
the
habit
of
bending
close
to
the
face
of
the
one
he
was
telling
his
story
to
and
crowding
him
in
the
crowded
leanto
rostov
silently
looked
at
him
first
of
all
it
surely
must
have
been
so
confused
and
crowded
on
the
dam
being
attacked
that
even
if
raevsky
did
bring
his
sons
there
it
couldnt
have
affected
anyone
except
a
dozen
or
so
men
who
were
right
there
with
him
thought
rostov
the
rest
couldnt
have
seen
how
raevsky
went
across
the
dam
and
with
whom
but
even
the
ones
who
saw
it
couldnt
have
felt
much
enthusiasm
because
what
did
they
care
about
raevskys
tender
paternal
feelings
when
it
was
a
matter
of
saving
their
own
skins
besides
that
the
fate
of
the
fatherland
didnt
depend
on
taking
or
not
taking
the
saltanovo
dam
the
way
they
say
it
was
with
thermopylae
and
therefore
why
offer
up
such
a
sacrifice
and
then
why
get
your
children
mixed
up
in
it
in
a
war
i
wouldnt
lead
my
brother
petya
into
it
or
even
ilyin
a
nice
boy
but
a
stranger
to
me
id
try
to
find
some
safe
place
to
put
him
rostov
went
on
thinking
as
he
listened
to
zdrzhinsky
but
he
did
not
voice
his
thoughts
he
already
had
experience
with
that
too
he
knew
that
this
story
contributed
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
therefore
one
had
to
make
it
seem
that
one
did
not
doubt
it
and
so
he
did
anyhow
i
cant
stand
it
said
ilyin
noticing
that
rostov
did
not
like
zdrzhinskys
conversation
my
socks
and
my
shirt
and
under
me
its
all
soaked
ill
go
and
find
some
shelter
the
rain
seems
to
be
letting
up
ilyin
left
and
zdrzhinsky
rode
away
five
minutes
later
ilyin
splashing
through
the
mud
came
running
to
the
leanto
hurrah
lets
go
quick
rostov
i
found
it
a
tavern
about
two
hundred
paces
from
here
our
boys
are
already
there
we
can
dry
out
and
marya
genrikhovnas
there
marya
genrikhovna
was
the
wife
of
the
regimental
doctor
a
young
pretty
german
woman
whom
the
doctor
had
married
in
poland
either
because
he
lacked
means
or
because
he
did
not
want
to
a
young
wife
so
early
in
their
marriage
the
doctor
took
her
along
everywhere
with
the
hussar
regiment
and
his
jealousy
had
become
a
habitual
subject
of
jokes
among
the
hussar
officers
rostov
threw
on
a
cloak
told
lavrushka
to
bring
the
things
and
went
with
ilyin
here
slipping
in
the
mud
there
splashing
straight
on
under
the
subsiding
rain
in
the
evening
darkness
occasionally
broken
by
distant
lightning
rostov
where
are
you
here
what
lightning
they
said
to
each
other
xiii
in
an
abandoned
tavern
before
which
stood
the
doctors
little
kibitka
there
were
already
some
five
officers
marya
genrikhovna
a
plump
flaxenhaired
german
in
a
bedjacket
and
nightcap
sat
in
the
front
corner
on
a
wide
bench
her
husband
the
doctor
was
asleep
behind
her
rostov
and
ilyin
greeted
with
merry
exclamations
and
guffaws
came
into
the
room
hey
arent
you
having
fun
rostov
said
laughing
and
why
are
you
missing
it
fine
ones
theyre
drenched
dont
get
our
drawing
room
wet
dont
get
marya
genrikhovnas
dress
muddy
voices
answered
rostov
and
ilyin
hastened
to
find
a
corner
where
they
could
change
their
wet
clothes
without
offending
marya
genrikhovnas
modesty
they
went
behind
a
partition
but
the
little
closet
was
entirely
taken
up
by
three
officers
playing
cards
on
an
empty
box
with
a
single
candle
on
it
who
absolutely
refused
to
let
them
in
to
change
marya
genrikhovna
allowed
them
to
take
her
skirt
using
it
as
a
curtain
and
behind
that
curtain
rostov
and
ilyin
with
the
help
of
lavrushka
who
brought
their
packs
took
off
their
wet
clothes
and
put
on
dry
a
fire
was
made
in
the
broken
stove
they
found
a
board
and
placing
it
on
two
saddles
covered
it
with
a
horse
blanket
found
a
little
samovar
a
cellaret
and
half
a
bottle
of
rum
and
the
officers
having
invited
marya
genrikhovna
to
be
the
hostess
crowded
around
her
one
offered
her
a
clean
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
lovely
little
hands
another
put
a
jacket
under
her
little
feet
so
that
they
would
not
get
damp
yet
another
screened
the
window
with
his
cloak
to
keep
out
the
draft
yet
another
fanned
the
flies
away
from
her
husbands
face
so
that
he
would
not
wake
up
let
him
be
marya
genrikhovna
said
with
a
timid
and
happy
smile
hes
sleeping
well
as
it
is
after
a
sleepless
night
never
marya
genrikhovna
the
officer
replied
we
must
wait
upon
our
doctor
maybe
hell
pity
me
when
hes
cutting
off
my
leg
or
arm
there
were
only
three
glasses
the
water
was
so
dirty
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
tea
was
strong
or
weak
and
the
samovar
only
held
water
enough
for
six
glasses
but
the
more
pleasant
it
was
to
receive
ones
glass
in
turn
and
by
seniority
from
the
plump
little
hands
of
marya
genrikhovna
with
their
short
nonetooclean
nails
all
the
officers
it
seemed
were
actually
in
love
with
marya
genrikhovna
that
evening
even
the
officers
who
were
playing
cards
behind
the
partition
soon
stopped
playing
and
went
over
to
the
samovar
yielding
to
the
general
atmosphere
of
courting
marya
genrikhovna
marya
genrikhovna
seeing
herself
surrounded
by
such
brilliant
and
polite
young
men
shone
with
happiness
however
she
tried
to
hide
it
and
however
timid
she
became
at
every
movement
her
sleeping
husband
made
behind
her
back
of
spoons
there
was
only
one
sugar
was
more
plentiful
than
anything
else
but
they
could
not
all
stir
at
the
same
time
and
so
it
was
decided
that
she
would
stir
the
sugar
for
each
of
them
in
turn
rostov
receiving
his
glass
poured
some
rum
into
it
and
asked
marya
genrikhovna
to
stir
it
but
do
you
take
it
without
sugar
she
asked
with
the
same
smile
as
if
everything
she
said
and
everything
the
others
said
was
very
funny
and
had
some
other
meaning
never
mind
the
sugar
i
just
want
you
to
stir
it
with
your
little
hand
marya
genrikhovna
agreed
and
began
looking
for
the
spoon
which
someone
had
already
snatched
up
use
your
finger
marya
genrikhovna
said
rostov
that
will
be
even
nicer
its
too
hot
said
marya
genrikhovna
blushing
with
pleasure
ilyin
took
a
bucket
of
water
and
pouring
a
drop
of
rum
into
it
came
to
marya
genrikhovna
asking
her
to
stir
it
with
her
finger
this
is
my
cup
he
said
only
dip
your
finger
into
it
and
ill
drink
it
all
when
the
whole
samovar
had
been
drunk
rostov
took
the
cards
and
suggested
a
game
of
kings
with
marya
genrikhovna
they
drew
lots
for
who
would
be
marya
genrikhovnas
partner
the
rules
of
the
game
were
at
rostovs
suggestion
that
whoever
was
the
king
had
the
right
to
kiss
marya
genrikhovnas
hand
and
that
whoever
was
left
the
knave
would
go
and
prepare
a
new
samovar
for
the
doctor
when
he
woke
up
and
what
if
marya
genrikhovna
is
the
king
asked
ilyin
shes
the
queen
as
it
is
and
her
orders
are
law
the
game
had
only
just
begun
when
the
doctors
tousled
head
suddenly
rose
up
behind
marya
genrikhovna
he
had
been
awake
for
a
long
time
and
listening
to
what
was
being
said
and
he
clearly
found
nothing
gay
funny
or
amusing
in
all
that
was
being
said
and
done
his
face
was
sad
and
glum
he
did
not
greet
the
officers
scratched
himself
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
step
out
because
they
tried
to
bar
his
way
as
soon
as
he
left
all
the
officers
burst
into
loud
guffaws
and
marya
genrikhovna
blushed
to
the
point
of
tears
and
became
still
more
attractive
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
officers
when
he
came
back
in
the
doctor
said
to
his
wife
who
had
already
stopped
smiling
so
happily
and
looked
at
him
fearfully
awaiting
her
sentence
that
the
rain
had
stopped
and
they
had
to
go
and
spend
the
night
in
their
kibitka
or
else
everything
would
be
stolen
but
ill
send
an
orderlytwo
orderlies
said
rostov
come
on
doctor
ill
stand
watch
myself
said
ilyin
no
gentlemen
youve
had
enough
sleep
and
i
havent
slept
for
two
nights
the
doctor
said
and
gloomily
sat
down
beside
to
his
wife
waiting
for
the
game
to
end
seeing
the
gloomy
face
of
the
doctor
looking
askance
at
his
wife
the
officers
grew
still
merrier
and
many
could
not
keep
from
laughing
for
which
they
hastily
tried
to
find
plausible
pretexts
when
the
doctor
left
taking
his
wife
along
and
settled
with
her
in
the
little
kibitka
the
officers
lay
down
in
the
tavern
covering
themselves
with
their
wet
greatcoats
but
for
a
long
time
they
did
not
sleep
now
talking
remembering
the
doctors
fright
and
his
wifes
merriment
now
running
out
to
the
porch
and
reporting
on
what
was
going
on
in
the
kibitka
several
times
rostov
covered
his
head
and
tried
to
fall
asleep
but
again
someones
remark
would
distract
him
again
a
conversation
would
begin
and
again
there
would
be
causeless
merry
childlike
laughter
xiv
it
was
past
two
oclock
and
no
one
was
asleep
yet
when
the
quartermaster
appeared
with
orders
to
set
out
for
the
little
village
of
ostrovna
still
with
the
same
talk
and
laughter
the
officers
quickly
began
to
get
ready
again
they
set
up
the
samovar
with
dirty
water
but
rostov
not
waiting
for
tea
went
to
his
squadron
dawn
was
breaking
the
rain
had
stopped
the
clouds
had
scattered
it
was
damp
and
cold
especially
in
stillwet
clothes
leaving
the
tavern
rostov
and
ilyin
in
the
halflight
of
dawn
peeked
into
the
doctors
little
kibitka
its
leather
glistening
from
the
rain
from
the
apron
of
which
the
doctors
legs
stuck
out
and
in
the
middle
of
which
they
could
see
his
wifes
nightcap
on
the
pillow
and
hear
her
sleepy
breathing
shes
really
very
sweet
rostov
said
to
ilyin
who
was
leaving
with
him
a
lovely
woman
ilyin
replied
with
a
sixteenyearolds
earnestness
half
an
hour
later
the
linedup
squadron
was
standing
on
the
road
the
command
mount
up
rang
out
the
soldiers
crossed
themselves
and
began
to
mount
up
rostov
riding
ahead
gave
the
command
march
and
stretching
out
four
abreast
the
hussars
with
the
sounds
of
hoofs
splashing
on
the
wet
road
the
clank
of
sabers
and
quiet
talk
started
down
the
big
birchlined
road
in
the
wake
of
the
preceding
infantry
and
artillery
the
ragged
bluishpurple
clouds
turning
red
in
the
east
were
driven
quickly
by
the
wind
it
was
growing
lighter
and
lighter
the
short
curly
grass
that
always
grows
at
the
sides
of
country
roads
was
clearly
visible
still
wet
from
last
nights
rain
the
hanging
branches
of
the
birches
also
wet
swayed
in
the
wind
and
shed
bright
drops
sideways
the
soldiers
faces
could
be
seen
more
and
more
clearly
rostov
rode
with
ilyin
who
never
lagged
behind
him
along
the
side
of
the
road
between
the
double
row
of
birches
while
on
campaign
rostov
allowed
himself
the
liberty
of
riding
a
cossack
horse
instead
of
a
regimental
one
a
fancier
and
a
hunter
he
had
recently
obtained
for
himself
a
fine
big
dashing
don
horse
light
chestnut
with
a
white
mane
and
tail
on
which
no
one
could
outgallop
him
it
was
a
pleasure
for
rostov
to
ride
this
horse
he
thought
about
the
horse
about
the
morning
about
the
doctors
wife
and
never
once
thought
about
the
impending
danger
formerly
going
into
action
rostov
had
been
afraid
now
he
did
not
feel
the
least
fear
he
was
not
afraid
not
because
he
was
used
to
gunfire
one
cannot
get
used
to
danger
but
because
he
had
learned
to
control
his
soul
in
the
face
of
danger
he
got
used
going
into
action
to
thinking
about
everything
except
what
would
seem
more
interesting
than
anything
elsethe
impending
danger
however
hard
he
had
tried
however
much
he
had
reproached
himself
for
cowardice
during
his
first
period
of
service
he
had
been
unable
to
achieve
this
but
now
with
the
years
it
had
come
by
itself
he
was
now
riding
beside
ilyin
between
the
birches
occasionally
pulling
leaves
off
the
branches
that
happened
in
his
way
occasionally
touching
the
horses
flank
with
his
foot
occasionally
handing
his
finished
pipe
without
turning
around
to
the
hussar
behind
himall
with
such
a
calm
and
carefree
air
as
though
he
was
just
out
for
a
ride
he
felt
pity
looking
at
the
troubled
face
of
ilyin
who
was
talking
much
and
anxiously
he
knew
from
his
own
experiece
that
tormenting
state
of
awaiting
fear
and
death
in
which
the
ensign
found
himself
and
knew
that
nothing
but
time
would
help
him
the
sun
had
only
just
appeared
in
the
clear
space
under
a
cloud
when
the
wind
died
as
if
not
daring
to
ruin
this
lovely
summer
morning
after
the
storm
the
drops
were
still
falling
vertically
now
and
all
became
still
the
sun
came
out
completely
appeared
on
the
horizon
and
vanished
into
the
long
narrow
cloud
that
stood
above
it
a
few
minutes
later
the
sun
appeared
still
more
brightly
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
cloud
tearing
its
edge
everything
lit
up
and
glistened
and
along
with
this
light
as
if
in
response
to
it
cannon
fire
rang
out
ahead
before
rostov
had
time
to
think
and
determine
how
far
away
those
shots
were
count
ostermanntolstoys
adjutant
came
galloping
from
vitebsk
with
orders
to
proceed
down
the
road
at
a
trot
the
squadron
overtook
the
infantry
and
artillery
which
also
speeded
up
went
down
a
hill
and
passing
through
some
empty
deserted
village
rode
uphill
again
the
horses
began
to
lather
the
mens
faces
became
flushed

from
ahead
and
the
hussars
following
the
line
of
troops
went
to
the
left
flank
position
and
stopped
behind
our
uhlans
who
stood
in
the
front
line
to
their
right
our
infantry
stood
in
a
dense
columnthis
was
the
reserve
higher
up
the
hill
in
the
perfectly
clear
air
in
the
slanting
bright
morning
light
just
on
the
horizonour
cannon
could
be
seen
ahead
beyond
a
hollow
the
enemys
columns
and
cannon
could
be
seen
in
the
hollow
our
front
line
which
had
already
gone
into
action
could
be
heard
merrily
exchanging
clacks
with
the
enemy
as
if
by
the
sounds
of
the
most
cheerful
music
rostov
felt
cheered
at
heart
by
these
sounds
which
he
had
not
heard
for
so
long
traptatatapseveral
shots
clapped
out
now
together
now
in
rapid
succession
then
all
fell
silent
and
then
came
the
crackling
again
as
if
someone
was
walking
on
firecrackers
the
hussars
stood
for
about
an
hour
in
the
same
place
a
cannonade
began
count
ostermann
and
his
suite
rode
up
behind
the
squadron
stopped
talked
with
the
commander
of
the
regiment
and
rode
off
towards
the
cannon
on
the
hill
after
ostermann
rode
off
a
command
to
the
uhlans
was
heard
column
form
up
for
the
attack
the
infantry
ahead
of
them
doubled
up
their
platoons
to
let
the
cavalry
pass
by
the
uhlans
set
off
pennants
flying
on
their
lances
and
trotted
downhill
towards
the
french
cavalry
which
had
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
to
the
left
as
soon
as
the
uhlans
had
gone
down
the
hill
the
hussars
were
ordered
to
move
up
the
hill
to
cover
the
battery
while
the
hussars
took
the
place
of
the
uhlans
bullets
came
flying
from
the
front
line
whining
and
whistling
missing
their
aim
by
far
this
sound
which
he
had
not
heard
for
a
long
time
had
a
still
more
joyful
and
rousing
effect
on
rostov
than
the
previous
sounds
of
shooting
drawing
himself
up
he
surveyed
the
battlefield
that
opened
out
from
the
hill
and
participated
wholeheartedly
in
the
movements
of
the
uhlans
the
uhlans
flew
down
close
to
the
french
dragoons
something
became
confused
there
in
the
smoke
and
five
minutes
later
the
uhlans
came
racing
back
not
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
but
more
to
the
left
among
the
orange
uhlans
on
chestnut
horses
and
behind
them
in
a
large
mass
the
blue
french
dragoons
on
gray
horses
could
be
seen
xv
rostov
with
his
keen
hunters
eye
was
one
of
the
first
to
see
these
blue
french
dragoons
pursuing
our
uhlans
closer
and
closer
came
the
disorderly
crowds
of
uhlans
and
the
french
dragoons
pursuing
them
it
was
already
possible
to
see
how
these
men
who
looked
small
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
clashed
together
chased
each
other
and
waved
their
arms
or
sabers
rostov
watched
what
was
happening
before
him
as
if
it
was
a
hunting
scene
he
sensed
intuitively
that
if
he
were
now
to
strike
the
french
dragoons
with
his
hussars
they
would
not
hold
out
but
if
he
were
to
strike
it
would
have
to
be
now
at
this
moment
otherwise
it
would
be
too
late
he
looked
around
a
captain
was
standing
next
to
him
his
eyes
also
fixed
on
the
cavalry
below
andrei
sevastyanych
said
rostov
you
know
we
could
crush
them
it
would
be
a
daring
thing
said
the
captain
and
in
fact
rostov
not
hearing
him
out
nudged
his
horse
leaped
ahead
of
the
squadron
and
before
he
had
time
to
command
it
to
move
the
whole
squadron
feeling
the
same
as
he
set
out
after
him
rostov
did
not
know
himself
how
and
why
he
was
doing
it
he
did
it
all
as
he
did
at
the
hunt
not
thinking
not
reflecting
he
saw
that
the
dragoons
were
near
that
they
were
galloping
in
disorder
he
knew
that
they
would
not
hold
and
he
knew
that
there
was
only
one
moment
which
would
not
return
if
he
missed
it
bullets
whined
and
whistled
so
stirringly
around
him
his
horse
strained
forward
so
ardently
that
he
could
not
control
himself
he
spurred
his
horse
gave
the
command
and
at
the
same
moment
hearing
the
hoofbeats
of
his
deployed
squadron
behind
him
started
down
at
a
full
trot
towards
the
dragoons
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
had
barely
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
when
their
trot
involuntarily
turned
into
a
gallop
which
became
faster
and
faster
as
they
drew
nearer
to
our
uhlans
and
the
french
dragoons
pursuing
them
the
dragoons
were
near
the
ones
in
front
seeing
the
hussars
began
to
turn
back
the
ones
behind
began
to
slow
down
with
the
feeling
with
which
he
raced
to
intercept
a
wolf
rostov
giving
his
don
horse
free
rein
galloped
to
intercept
the
disordered
lines
of
the
french
dragoons
one
uhlan
stopped
one
on
foot
fell
to
the
ground
to
avoid
being
crushed
one
riderless
horse
mingled
with
the
hussars
almost
all
the
french
dragoons
were
galloping
away
rostov
picking
himself
one
on
a
gray
horse
raced
after
him
on
the
way
he
galloped
into
a
bush
the
good
horse
carried
him
over
it
and
barely
straightening
himself
in
the
saddle
nikolai
saw
that
in
a
few
seconds
he
would
overtake
the
enemy
he
had
picked
out
as
his
target
the
frenchmanprobably
an
officer
by
his
uniformhunched
over
was
galloping
along
on
his
gray
horse
urging
it
on
with
his
saber
a
moment
later
rostovs
horse
struck
the
officers
horse
in
the
rump
with
its
breast
almost
knocking
it
down
and
at
the
same
moment
rostov
not
knowing
why
himself
raised
his
saber
and
struck
the
frenchman
with
it
the
moment
he
did
this
all
rostovs
animation
suddenly
vanished
the
officer
fell
not
so
much
from
the
stroke
of
the
sword
which
only
cut
his
arm
slightly
above
the
elbow
as
from
the
jolt
to
his
horse
and
from
fear
reining
in
his
horse
rostov
sought
his
enemy
with
his
eyes
to
see
whom
he
had
vanquished
the
french
dragoon
officer
was
hopping
on
the
ground
with
one
foot
the
other
being
caught
in
the
stirrup
narrowing
his
eyes
fearfully
as
if
expecting
a
new
blow
any
second
he
winced
glancing
up
at
rostov
from
below
with
an
expression
of
terror
his
face
pale
and
mudspattered
fairhaired
young
with
a
dimple
on
the
chin
and
light
blue
eyes
was
not
at
all
for
the
battlefield
not
an
enemys
face
but
a
most
simple
homelike
face
before
rostov
decided
what
to
do
with
him
the
officer
cried
out
je
me
rends
he
hurriedly
tried
but
was
unable
to
disentangle
his
foot
from
the
stirrup
and
his
frightened
light
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
rostov
some
hussars
galloped
up
to
him
freed
his
foot
and
sat
him
in
the
saddle
hussars
on
all
sides
were
busy
with
the
dragoons
one
was
wounded
but
with
his
face
all
covered
with
blood
refused
to
surrender
his
horse
another
his
arms
around
a
hussar
sat
on
his
horses
croup
a
third
supported
by
a
hussar
was
getting
on
his
horse
in
front
of
them
french
infantry
came
running
and
shooting
the
hussars
hurriedly
galloped
away
with
their
prisoners
rostov
galloped
away
with
the
others
experiencing
some
unpleasant
feeling
which
wrung
his
heart
something
unclear
confused
something
he
was
unable
to
explain
to
himself
had
been
revealed
to
him
in
the
capture
of
this
officer
and
the
blow
he
had
given
him
count
ostermanntolstoy
met
the
returning
hussars
sent
for
rostov
thanked
him
and
said
that
he
would
report
his
daring
action
to
the
sovereign
and
request
the
st
george
cross
for
him
when
rostov
was
summoned
to
count
ostermann
he
remembering
that
his
attack
had
been
begun
without
orders
was
fully
convinced
that
his
superior
had
called
for
him
in
order
to
punish
him
for
unwarranted
action
ostermanns
flattering
words
and
the
promise
of
a
reward
should
therefore
have
been
a
joyful
surprise
for
rostov
yet
the
same
unpleasant
unclear
feeling
nauseated
him
morally
what
on
earth
is
tormenting
me
he
asked
himself
as
he
rode
back
from
the
general
ilyin
no
hes
safe
did
i
disgrace
myself
somehow
no
its
not
that
something
else
tormented
him
something
like
remorse
yes
yes
that
french
officer
with
the
dimple
and
i
remember
very
well
how
my
arm
stopped
as
i
raised
it
rostov
saw
the
prisoners
being
taken
away
and
rode
after
them
to
look
at
his
frenchman
with
the
dimple
in
his
chin
he
was
sitting
in
his
strange
uniform
on
a
spare
hussar
horse
and
looking
around
uneasily
the
wound
on
his
arm
was
almost
not
a
wound
he
feigned
a
smile
at
rostov
and
waved
to
him
by
way
of
greeting
rostov
still
felt
awkward
and
as
if
ashamed
of
something
that
whole
day
and
the
next
rostovs
friends
and
comrades
noticed
that
he
was
not
dull
not
angry
but
silent
pensive
and
concentrated
he
drank
reluctantly
tried
to
stay
alone
and
kept
thinking
about
something
rostov
kept
thinking
about
that
brilliant
feat
of
his
which
to
his
surprise
had
gained
him
the
st
george
cross
and
even
given
him
the
reputation
of
a
brave
manand
there
was
something
in
it
that
he
was
unable
to
understand
so
theyre
even
more
afraid
than
we
are
he
thought
so
thats
all
there
is
to
socalled
heroism
and
did
i
really
do
it
for
the
fatherland
and
what
harm
had
he
done
with
his
dimple
and
his
light
blue
eyes
but
how
frightened
he
was
he
thought
id
kill
him
why
should
i
kill
him
my
hand
faltered
and
they
gave
me
the
st
george
cross
i
understand
nothing
nothing
but
while
nikolai
was
working
out
all
these
questions
within
himself
still
without
giving
himself
a
clear
accounting
of
what
confused
him
so
much
the
wheel
of
fortune
of
military
service
as
often
happens
turned
in
his
favor
after
the
ostrovna
action
he
was
promoted
was
given
a
battalion
of
hussars
and
whenever
a
brave
officer
was
called
for
the
mission
was
given
to
him
xvi
on
receiving
the
news
of
natashas
illness
the
countess
though
not
quite
recovered
and
still
weak
went
to
moscow
with
petya
and
all
the
household
and
the
whole
rostov
family
moved
from
marya
dmitrievnas
to
their
own
house
and
settled
in
moscow
natashas
illness
was
so
serious
that
fortunately
for
her
and
for
her
family
the
thought
of
all
that
had
been
the
cause
of
her
illnessher
act
and
the
break
with
her
fianc233moved
into
the
background
she
was
so
ill
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
how
much
she
was
to
blame
in
all
that
had
happened
while
she
did
not
eat
did
not
sleep
grew
noticeably
thinner
coughed
and
was
as
the
doctors
let
it
be
felt
in
danger
they
had
to
think
only
of
how
to
help
her
doctors
visited
natasha
both
singly
and
in
consultation
spoke
a
good
deal
of
french
german
and
latin
denounced
one
another
prescribed
the
most
varied
medications
for
all
the
illnesses
known
to
them
but
the
simple
thought
never
occurred
to
any
of
them
that
they
could
not
know
the
illness
natasha
was
suffering
from
as
no
illness
that
afflicts
a
living
human
being
can
be
known
for
each
human
being
has
his
peculiarities
and
always
has
his
own
peculiar
complex
illness
unknown
to
medical
science
not
an
illness
of
the
lungs
the
liver
the
skin
the
heart
the
nerves
and
so
on
recorded
in
medicine
but
an
illness
consisting
in
one
of
the
countless
combinations
of
afflictions
of
these
organs
this
simple
thought
did
not
occur
to
the
doctors
just
as
it
cannot
occur
to
a
sorcerer
that
he
cannot
do
sorcery
because
their
lifes
activity
consisted
in
treating
patients
because
that
was
what
they
were
paid
for
and
because
they
had
spent
the
best
days
of
their
lives
doing
it
but
above
all
this
thought
could
not
occur
to
the
doctors
because
they
saw
that
they
were
unquestionably
useful
and
indeed
they
were
useful
to
all
the
rostov
household
they
were
useful
not
because
they
made
the
patient
swallow
what
were
for
the
most
substances
the
harm
was
little
felt
because
the
harmful
substances
were
given
in
small
quantities
but
they
were
useful
necessary
inevitable
for
the
same
reason
that
there
are
and
always
will
be
imaginary
healers
fortunetellers
homeopaths
and
allopaths
because
they
satisfied
the
moral
need
of
the
sick
girl
and
the
people
who
loved
her
they
satisfied
that
eternal
human
need
for
the
hope
of
relief
the
need
for
compassion
and
action
which
a
human
being
experiences
in
a
time
of
suffering
they
satisfied
that
eternal
human
neednoticeable
in
a
child
in
its
most
primitive
formto
rub
the
place
that
hurts
when
a
child
hurts
himself
he
runs
at
once
to
his
mothers
or
nannys
arms
to
have
the
hurt
place
kissed
and
rubbed
and
he
feels
better
once
the
hurt
place
is
kissed
or
rubbed
the
child
does
not
believe
that
those
who
are
stronger
and
wiser
than
he
have
no
means
to
help
his
pain
and
the
hope
of
relief
and
the
show
of
compassion
comfort
him
while
his
mother
rubs
his
bump
the
doctors
were
of
use
to
natasha
because
they
kissed
and
rubbed
her
booboo
assuring
her
that
it
would
go
away
at
once
if
the
coachman
drove
to
the
arbat
pharmacy
and
bought
one
rouble
and
seventy
kopecks
worth
of
powders
and
pills
in
a
pretty
box
and
if
the
sick
girl
made
sure
to
take
them
with
boiled
water
every
two
hours
not
more
or
less
what
would
sonya
the
count
and
countess
have
done
how
could
they
have
looked
at
the
weak
wasting
natasha
without
undertaking
anything
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
taking
of
pills
at
specific
times
warm
drinks
chicken
cutlets
and
all
the
details
of
life
prescribed
by
the
doctors
the
observance
of
which
constituted
the
occupation
and
comfort
of
everyone
around
her
the
more
strict
and
complicated
the
rules
the
more
comforting
it
was
for
everyone
how
could
the
count
have
borne
the
illness
of
his
beloved
daughter
if
he
had
not
known
that
natashas
illness
was
costing
him
thousands
of
roubles
and
that
he
would
not
spare
thousands
more
to
be
of
use
to
her
if
he
had
not
known
that
if
she
did
not
get
better
he
would
spend
thousands
more
and
take
her
abroad
and
hold
consultations
there
if
he
had
had
no
occasion
to
talk
in
detail
about
how
m233tivier
and
feller
had
not
understood
the
illness
but
frieze
had
and
mudrov
had
diagnosed
it
still
better
what
would
the
countess
have
done
if
she
had
not
been
able
to
quarrel
occasionally
with
the
sick
natasha
for
not
fully
observing
the
doctors
prescriptions
that
way
youll
never
get
well
she
said
forgetting
her
grief
in
her
vexation
if
you
dont
want
to
listen
to
the
doctor
and
take
your
medicine
on
time
you
shouldnt
joke
with
it
you
might
get
pneumonia
said
the
countess
and
in
the
pronouncing
of
this
word
incomprehensible
not
only
for
herself
she
already
found
great
comfort
what
would
sonya
have
done
if
she
had
not
been
joyfully
aware
that
in
the
beginning
she
had
not
undressed
for
three
nights
so
as
to
be
ready
to
fulfill
all
the
doctors
prescriptions
precisely
and
that
now
she
did
not
sleep
at
night
so
as
not
to
miss
the
time
for
administering
the
nottooharmful
pills
from
the
little
gold
box
even
natasha
herself
who
said
that
no
medicine
could
cure
her
and
that
it
was
all
stupideven
she
was
glad
to
see
that
so
many
sacrifices
were
being
made
for
her
and
that
she
had
to
take
medicine
at
certain
times
and
she
was
even
glad
that
by
neglecting
what
had
been
prescribed
she
could
show
that
she
did
not
believe
in
the
treatment
and
did
not
value
her
life
the
doctor
came
every
day
felt
her
pulse
looked
at
her
tongue
and
joked
with
her
paying
no
attention
to
her
griefstricken
face
on
the
other
hand
when
he
went
out
to
the
other
room
the
countess
hurriedly
followed
him
and
he
assuming
a
serious
air
and
shaking
his
head
pensively
said
that
although
there
was
danger
he
had
hopes
for
the
effectiveness
of
this
latest
medicine
and
that
they
must
wait
and
see
that
the
illness
was
more
moral
but
the
countess
trying
to
conceal
this
action
from
herself
and
the
doctor
would
put
a
gold
piece
in
his
hand
and
go
back
to
her
daughter
each
time
with
her
heart
more
at
ease
the
signs
of
natashas
illness
were
that
she
ate
little
slept
little
coughed
and
never
became
animated
the
doctors
said
that
the
sick
girl
must
not
be
left
without
medical
help
and
therefore
she
was
kept
in
the
close
air
of
the
city
in
the
summer
of
1812
the
rostovs
did
not
leave
for
the
country
despite
the
large
quantity
of
pills
drops
and
powders
she
had
swallowed
from
little
jars
and
boxes
of
which
madame
schoss
a
great
lover
of
such
objects
had
assembled
a
large
collection
despite
the
absence
of
her
accustomed
country
life
youth
had
its
way
natashas
grief
began
to
be
covered
over
by
the
impressions
of
ongoing
life
it
ceased
to
weigh
with
such
tormenting
pain
on
her
heart
it
began
to
become
the
past
and
natasha
started
to
recover
physically
xvii
natasha
was
more
calm
but
not
more
cheerful
she
not
only
avoided
all
external
conditions
of
joyfulnessballs
promenades
concerts
the
theaterbut
she
never
once
laughed
so
that
tears
were
not
heard
behind
her
laughter
she
could
not
sing
as
soon
as
she
began
to
laugh
or
tried
to
sing
when
she
was
by
herself
tears
choked
her
tears
of
remorse
tears
of
remembrance
of
that
irretrievable
time
of
purity
tears
of
vexation
that
just
so
for
nothing
she
had
ruined
her
young
life
which
might
have
been
so
happy
laughter
and
singing
especially
seemed
to
her
a
blasphemy
against
her
grief
of
coquetry
she
never
even
thought
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
restrain
herself
she
said
and
felt
that
at
that
time
all
men
were
for
her
exactly
like
the
buffoon
nastasya
ivanovna
an
inner
guard
firmly
forbade
her
every
joy
and
there
were
in
her
none
of
those
former
interests
of
life
from
the
girlish
carefree
hopefilled
life
she
used
to
lead
most
often
and
most
painfully
of
all
she
remembered
those
autumn
months
the
hunting
the
uncle
and
christmastime
spent
with
nicolas
at
otradnoe
what
would
she
not
have
given
to
bring
back
just
one
day
of
that
time
but
now
it
was
over
forever
her
presentiment
had
not
deceived
her
then
that
that
state
of
freedom
and
openness
to
all
joys
would
never
return
again
yet
one
had
to
live
it
comforted
her
to
think
that
she
was
not
better
as
she
had
thought
before
but
worse
much
worse
than
everyone
everyone
in
the
world
but
that
was
not
all
she
knew
it
and
asked
herself
and
what
then
and
then
there
was
nothing
there
was
no
joy
in
life
and
life
was
going
by
natasha
clearly
tried
only
not
to
be
a
burden
to
anyone
or
to
bother
anyone
but
for
herself
she
wanted
nothing
she
avoided
everyone
in
the
house
and
only
felt
at
ease
with
her
brother
petya
she
liked
being
with
him
more
than
with
the
others
and
sometimes
when
they
were
alone
together
she
laughed
she
hardly
ever
left
the
house
and
of
those
who
came
to
see
them
she
was
glad
only
of
pierre
it
was
impossible
to
treat
her
more
tenderly
more
carefully
and
at
the
same
time
more
seriously
than
count
bezukhov
treated
her
natasha
unconsciously
felt
this
tenderness
of
his
treatment
and
therefore
found
great
pleasure
in
his
company
but
she
was
not
even
grateful
to
him
for
his
tenderness
nothing
good
on
pierres
an
effort
to
her
it
seemed
so
natural
for
pierre
to
be
kind
to
everyone
that
there
was
no
merit
in
his
kindness
occasionally
natasha
noticed
pierres
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
in
her
presence
especially
when
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
please
her
or
when
he
was
afraid
that
something
in
their
conversation
might
lead
natasha
to
painful
memories
she
noticed
it
and
ascribed
it
to
his
general
kindness
and
timidity
which
to
her
mind
must
be
the
same
with
her
as
with
everyone
else
after
those
inadvertent
words
that
if
he
were
free
he
would
go
on
his
knees
and
ask
for
her
hand
and
her
love
spoken
at
a
moment
of
such
intense
emotion
for
her
pierre
had
never
said
anything
about
his
feelings
for
her
and
it
was
obvious
to
her
that
the
words
which
had
comforted
her
so
much
then
had
been
spoken
the
way
all
sorts
of
meaningless
words
are
spoken
to
comfort
a
weeping
child
not
because
pierre
was
a
married
man
but
because
natasha
felt
in
the
highest
degree
the
strength
of
the
moral
barriers
between
themthe
absence
of
which
she
had
felt
with
kuraginit
never
entered
her
head
that
her
relations
with
pierre
might
lead
not
only
to
love
on
her
side
still
less
on
his
but
even
to
that
sort
of
tender
selfaware
poetic
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
of
which
she
knew
several
examples
at
the
end
of
st
peters
fast
agrafena
ivanovna
belov
the
rostovs
neighbor
in
otradnoe
came
to
moscow
to
venerate
the
moscow
saints
she
suggested
that
natasha
prepare
for
communion
and
natasha
joyfully
seized
upon
the
idea
despite
the
doctors
prohibition
on
going
out
early
in
the
morning
natasha
insisted
on
preparing
and
preparing
not
as
it
was
usually
done
in
the
rostovs
home
that
is
by
hearing
three
services
at
home
but
as
agrafena
ivanovna
did
it
that
is
for
the
whole
week
without
missing
a
single
vespers
liturgy
or
matins
the
countess
liked
this
zeal
of
natashas
after
the
unsuccessful
medical
treatment
she
hoped
in
her
heart
that
prayer
would
help
her
more
than
medications
and
she
consented
to
natashas
wish
though
with
fear
and
concealing
it
from
the
doctor
and
entrusted
her
to
mrs
belov
agrafena
ivanovna
would
come
at
three
oclock
in
the
morning
to
wake
natasha
and
most
often
found
her
already
up
natasha
was
afraid
to
sleep
through
the
time
for
matins
washing
hastily
and
dressing
humbly
in
the
poorest
of
her
dresses
and
an
old
mantilla
shivering
in
the
fresh
air
natasha
would
go
out
into
the
deserted
streets
transparently
lit
up
by
the
glow
of
dawn
on
agrafena
ivanovnas
advice
natasha
went
to
the
services
not
in
her
own
parish
but
in
a
church
in
which
according
to
the
pious
mrs
belov
there
was
a
priest
of
quite
strict
and
lofty
life
in
the
church
there
were
always
few
people
natasha
and
mrs
belov
would
stand
in
their
usual
place
before
the
icon
of
the
mother
of
god
built
into
the
back
of
the
lefthand
choir
and
a
new
feeling
of
humility
would
come
over
natasha
before
the
great
the
unknowable
when
at
this
unaccustomed
hour
of
morning
looking
at
the
blackened
face
of
the
mother
of
god
lit
by
candles
and
the
light
of
morning
coming
from
the
window
she
listened
to
the
words
of
the
service
which
she
tried
to
follow
and
understand
when
she
understood
them
her
personal
feeling
with
its
nuances
joined
with
her
prayer
when
she
did
not
the
sweeter
it
was
for
her
to
think
that
the
wish
to
understand
everything
was
pride
that
it
was
impossible
to
understand
everything
that
she
only
had
to
believe
and
give
herself
to
god
who
in
those
momentsshe
feltwas
guiding
her
soul
she
crossed
herself
bowed
and
when
she
did
not
understand
only
asked
god
in
horror
at
her
own
vileness
to
forgive
her
for
everything
everything
and
to
have
mercy
on
her
the
prayers
she
gave
herself
to
most
of
all
were
prayers
of
repentance
returning
home
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
when
she
met
only
masons
going
to
work
and
yard
porters
sweeping
the
streets
and
everyone
in
the
houses
was
still
asleep
natasha
experienced
a
new
feeling
of
the
possibility
of
correcting
her
vices
and
the
possibility
of
a
new
pure
life
and
happiness
during
the
whole
week
in
which
she
led
this
life
that
feeling
grew
every
day
and
the
happiness
of
taking
communion
or
of
communicating
as
agrafena
ivanovna
used
to
say
playing
joyfully
with
the
word
seemed
so
great
to
her
that
she
thought
she
would
never
survive
till
that
blessed
sunday
but
the
happy
day
came
and
when
natasha
on
that
sunday
so
memorable
for
her
in
a
white
muslin
dress
came
home
after
communion
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
she
felt
calm
and
not
burdened
by
the
life
that
lay
ahead
of
her
the
doctor
came
that
day
examined
natasha
and
said
she
should
continue
to
take
those
last
powders
he
had
prescribed
two
weeks
ago
be
sure
to
continue
morning
and
evening
he
said
clearly
pleased
in
all
good
conscience
with
his
success
only
i
beg
you
be
precise
dont
worry
countess
the
doctor
said
jokingly
catching
the
gold
piece
deftly
in
his
soft
palm
shell
soon
be
singing
and
frolicking
again
this
last
medicine
is
very
very
good
for
her
shes
quite
refreshed
the
countess
looked
at
her
nails
spat
on
them
a
little
for
luck
and
went
back
to
the
drawing
room
with
a
cheerful
face
xviii
at
the
beginning
of
july
more
and
more
alarming
rumors
spread
in
moscow
about
the
course
of
the
war
there
was
talk
of
the
sovereigns
appeal
to
the
people
about
the
sovereign
coming
himself
from
the
army
to
moscow
and
since
up
to
the
eleventh
of
july
the
manifesto
and
appeal
had
not
been
received
exaggerated
rumors
about
them
and
about
the
situation
of
russia
went
around
it
was
said
that
the
sovereign
had
left
the
army
because
it
was
in
danger
it
was
said
that
smolensk
had
surrendered
that
napoleon
had
a
million
troops
and
that
only
a
miracle
could
save
russia
on
the
eleventh
of
july
a
saturday
the
manifesto
was
received
but
not
yet
printed
and
pierre
who
was
at
the
rostovs
promised
to
come
the
next
day
sunday
for
dinner
and
bring
the
manifesto
and
appeal
which
he
was
to
obtain
from
count
rastopchin
that
sunday
the
rostovs
as
usual
went
to
the
liturgy
at
the
razumovskys
house
chapel
it
was
a
hot
july
day
by
ten
oclock
when
the
rostovs
were
getting
out
of
the
carriage
before
the
church
in
the
hot
air
in
the
cries
of
the
hawkers
in
the
light
and
gaycolored
summer
clothes
of
the
crowd
in
the
dusty
leaves
of
the
trees
along
the
boulevard
in
the
sounds
of
the
music
and
the
white
breeches
of
a
battalion
marching
to
change
the
guard
in
the
rattling
of
carriages
over
the
cobblestones
and
in
the
bright
brilliance
of
the
hot
sun
there
was
already
that
summer
languor
that
content
and
discontent
with
the
present
which
is
felt
especially
strongly
on
a
clear
hot
day
in
town
all
the
moscow
nobility
all
the
rostovs
acquaintances
were
in
the
razumovskys
chapel
that
year
as
if
expecting
something
many
wealthy
families
who
usually
went
off
to
their
country
estates
stayed
in
town
walking
behind
the
liveried
footman
who
made
way
through
the
crowd
before
her
mother
natasha
heard
a
young
mans
voice
saying
of
her
in
much
too
loud
a
whisper
thats
miss
rostov
the
one
who
shes
thinner
but
still
pretty
she
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
the
names
of
kuragin
and
bolkonsky
mentioned
however
it
always
seemed
so
to
her
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
who
looked
at
her
thought
only
of
what
had
happened
to
her
suffering
and
with
a
sinking
heart
as
always
in
a
crowd
natasha
walked
in
her
violet
dress
with
black
lace
as
women
know
how
to
walkthe
more
calmly
and
majestically
the
more
pained
and
ashamed
she
felt
at
heart
she
knew
she
was
pretty
and
she
was
not
mistaken
but
that
did
not
cause
her
joy
as
it
used
to
on
the
contrary
it
tormented
her
most
of
all
lately
and
especially
on
this
bright
hot
summer
day
in
town
one
sunday
later
one
week
later
she
said
to
herself
remembering
how
she
had
been
here
the
last
sunday
and
its
the
same
life
without
living
and
the
same
conditions
in
which
it
used
to
be
so
easy
to
live
im
pretty
im
young
and
i
know
that
im
good
now
i
was
bad
before
but
now
im
good
i
know
it
she
thought
and
yet
my
best
years
are
going
by
for
nothing
for
nobody
she
stationed
herself
next
to
her
mother
and
exchanged
words
with
acquaintances
who
stood
nearby
out
of
habit
natasha
studied
the
ladies
dresses
disapproved
of
the
tenue
of
a
lady
near
her
and
the
improper
way
she
crossed
herself
with
a
quick
little
movement
again
thought
with
vexation
that
she
was
being
judged
that
she
herself
was
judging
and
suddenly
hearing
the
sounds
of
the
service
was
horrified
at
her
own
vileness
horrified
that
the
former
purity
was
again
lost
to
her
a
seemly
gentle
little
old
man
was
serving
with
that
meek
solemnity
which
has
such
an
exalting
and
soothing
effect
on
the
souls
of
the
praying
people
the
royal
doors
closed
the
curtain
was
slowly
drawn
a
mysterious
gentle
voice
pronounced
something
from
inside
tears
incomprehensible
to
herself
rose
in
natashas
breast
and
a
joyful
and
agonizing
feeling
stirred
her
teach
me
what
im
to
do
how
im
to
set
myself
right
forever
forever
how
im
to
live
my
life
she
thought
the
deacon
came
out
to
the
ambo
released
his
long
hair
from
under
his
dalmatic
with
a
widespread
thumb
and
making
a
cross
on
his
breast
began
loudly
and
solemnly
to
read
the
words
of
the
prayer
in
peace
let
us
pray
to
the
lord
as
one
worldall
together
without
distinction
of
rank
without
enmity
but
united
in
brotherly
lovelet
us
pray
thought
natasha
for
the
peace
from
above
and
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
for
the
world
of
the
angels
and
the
souls
of
all
the
bodiless
beings
who
dwell
above
us
natasha
prayed
when
they
prayed
for
the
military
forces
she
remembered
her
brother
and
denisov
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
travel
by
land
and
sea
she
remembered
prince
andrei
and
prayed
for
him
and
also
prayed
that
god
forgive
her
the
wrong
she
had
done
him
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
love
us
she
prayed
for
everyone
at
home
for
her
father
mother
sonya
now
understanding
for
the
first
time
all
her
guilt
before
them
and
feeling
all
the
strength
of
her
love
for
them
when
they
prayed
for
those
who
hate
us
she
invented
enemies
and
those
who
hated
her
in
order
to
pray
for
them
she
counted
as
enemies
the
creditors
and
all
those
who
had
dealings
with
her
father
and
each
time
at
the
thought
of
enemies
and
those
who
hate
us
she
remembered
anatole
who
had
done
her
so
much
wrong
and
though
he
did
not
hate
her
she
joyfully
prayed
for
him
as
an
enemy
only
while
praying
did
she
feel
herself
able
to
recall
clearly
and
calmly
both
prince
andrei
and
anatole
as
people
for
whom
her
feelings
were
as
nothing
compared
to
her
feeling
of
fear
and
reverence
for
god
when
they
prayed
for
the
tsars
family
and
the
synod
she
made
especially
low
bows
and
crossed
herself
thinking
that
even
if
she
did
not
understand
she
could
not
doubt
and
all
the
same
loved
the
ruling
synod
and
prayed
for
it
having
finished
the
prayers
of
petition
the
deacon
crossed
his
stole
over
his
breast
and
said
let

natasha
repeated
in
her
soul

natasha
said
with
tender
impatience
in
her
soul
not
crossing
herself
but
lowering
her
thin
arms
and
as
if
waiting
for
some
unknown
power
to
take
her
and
deliver
her
from
herself
from
her
regrets
desires
reproaches
hopes
and
vices
several
times
during
the
service
the
countess
turned
to
look
at
her
daughters
face
touched
by
emotion
with
shining
eyes
and
prayed
to
god
that
he
help
her
unexpectedly
in
the
middle
and
outside
the
order
of
the
service
which
natasha
knew
well
a
beadle
brought
out
a
little
footstool
the
same
as
was
used
for
the
kneeling
prayers
on
the
feast
of
the
trinity
and
placed
it
in
front
of
the
royal
doors
the
priest
came
out
in
his
purple
velvet
cap
smoothed
his
hair
and
knelt
with
effort
everybody
did
the
same
and
looked
at
each
other
with
perplexity
this
was
a
prayer
just
received
from
the
synod
a
prayer
for
the
salvation
of
russia
from
foreign
invasion
lord
god
of
hosts
god
of
our
salvation
the
priest
began
in
that
clear
unostentatious
and
meek
voice
in
which
only
clergy
reading
in
slavonic
read
and
which
affects
the
russian
heart
so
irresistibly
lord
god
of
hosts

to
overthrow
thine

to
violate

according
to

with
thine
almighty

thou
didst

and
to
david
over
goliath
preserve
his
army
place
a
bow
of
brass
into
the
hands
of
those
fighting
in
thy
name
and
gird
them
with
the
power
to
make
war
take
up
thine
arms
and
shield
and
arise
to
help
us
so
that
those
who
contrive
evil
against
us
may
be
put
to
shame
and
disgrace
let
them
be
before
the
face
of
thy
faithful
army
like
dust
before
the
face
of
the
wind
and
let
thy
mighty
angel
discomfit
them
and
drive
them
hence
let
the
net
they
know
not
of
come
upon
them
let
the
trap
concealed
from
them
ensnare
them
so
that
they
fall
under
the
feet
of
thy
servants
and
our
warriors
may
trample
upon
them
lord
let
thy
power
to

drive
us
not

from
thy
face
neither
scorn
our
unworthiness
but
have
mercy
upon

according
to
thy
great
mercy
and
in
the
abundance
of
thy
compassion
regard
not
our
sins
and

create
in
us
a
pure
heart
and
renew
a

within
us
strengthen

all
with

with
true

with
oneness
of
spirit
in
righteous
defense
of
the
inheritance

thou
hast
granted
to

and
to
our

so
that
the
rod
of
the
unrighteous
be

sanctified
lord

make
a
sign
for
the
good
so
that
those
who
hate

and
our
orthodox

may
be
put
to

this
day
thy
mercy
o

salvation
make
the
hearts
of
thy
servants
rejoice
in
thy
mercy
strike
down
our
enemies
and
swiftly
crush
them
under
the
feet
of
thy
faithful
for
thou
art
the
defense
the
succor
and
the
victory
of
those
who
put
their
trust
in
thee
and
to
thee
we
ascribe
glory
to
the
father
and
to
the
son
and
to
the
holy
spirit
now
and
ever
and
unto
ages
of
ages
amen
in
that
state
of
inner
openness
in
which
natasha
found
herself
this
prayer
had
a
strong
effect
on
her
she
listened
to
every
word
about
the
victory
of
moses
over
amalek
and
gideon
over
midian
and
david
over
goliath
and
about
the
destruction
of
thy
jerusalem
and
asked
god
with
that
tenderness
and
softness
with
which
her
heart
was
overflowingbut
she
did
not
understand
very
well
what
she
was
asking
of
god
in
this
prayer
with
her
whole
soul
she
participated
in
the
petition
about
a
right
spirit
about
the
strengthening
of
hearts
with
faith
hope
and
inspiring
them
with
love
but
she
could
not
pray
about
trampling
her
enemies
under
her
feet
when
a
few
moments
before
she
had
wished
to
have
more
of
them
so
as
to
love
them
and
pray
for
them
but
she
also
could
not
doubt
the
rightness
of
the
kneeling
prayer
that
was
being
read
she
felt
in
her
soul
the
reverent
and
trembling
fear
before
the
punishment
that
comes
upon
people
for
their
sins
especially
upon
her
for
her
sins
and
asked
god
to
forgive
them
all
and
herself
and
to
grant
them
all
and
herself
peace
and
happiness
in
life
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
god
heard
her
prayer
xix
since
the
day
when
pierre
leaving
the
rostovs
and
remembering
natashas
grateful
eyes
had
looked
at
the
comet
that
hung
in
the
sky
and
had
felt
that
something
new
had
been
revealed
to
himthe
question
that
eternally
tormented
him
about
the
vanity
and
folly
of
all
earthly
things
had
stopped
presenting
itself
to
him
that
terrible
questionwhy
what
forwhich
used
to
present
itself
to
him
amidst
every
occupation
was
now
replaced
for
him
not
by
another
question
and
not
by
the
answer
to
the
old
question
but
by
her
image
listening
to
a
trivial
conversation
or
engaged
in
one
himself
or
reading
or
learning
about
the
baseness
and
senselessness
of
people
he
was
not
horrified
as
he
used
to
be
he
did
not
ask
himself
why
people
made
a
fuss
if
everything
was
so
brief
and
unknown
but
he
remembered
her
the
way
he
had
seen
her
the
last
time
and
all
his
doubts
vanished
not
because
she
answered
the
questions
that
presented
themselves
to
him
but
because
her
image
immediately
transferred
him
to
a
different
bright
realm
of
inner
activity
in
which
no
one
could
be
right
or
wrong
into
a
realm
of
beauty
and
love
for
which
it
was
worth
living
whatever
vileness
of
life
presented
itself
to
him
he
said
to
himself
well
let
soandso
steal
from
the
state
and
the
tsar
and
the
state
and
the
tsar
confer
honors
on
him
but
yesterday
she
smiled
at
me
and
asked
me
to
come
and
i
love
her
and
nobody
will
ever
know
it
he
thought
pierre
still
went
into
society
still
drank
as
much
and
led
the
same
idle
and
dissipated
life
because
besides
the
hours
he
spent
at
the
rostovs
he
had
the
rest
of
the
time
to
spend
and
the
habits
and
acquaintances
he
had
acquired
in
moscow
drew
him
irresistibly
to
the
life
he
was
caught
up
in
but
lately
when
ever
more
alarming
rumors
kept
coming
from
the
theater
of
war
and
natashas
health
began
to
improve
and
she
ceased
to
arouse
in
him
the
former
feeling
of
protective
pity
an
anxiety
he
found
more
and
more
incomprehensible
began
to
come
over
him
he
felt
that
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
could
not
continue
for
long
that
a
catastrophe
was
coming
which
was
bound
to
change
his
whole
life
and
he
impatiently
sought
signs
of
this
approaching
catastrophe
in
everything
one
of
his
brother
masons
revealed
to
pierre
the
following
prophecy
concerning
napoleon
and
derived
from
the
apocalypse
of
st
john
in
the
apocalypse
chapter
13
verse
18
it
was
said
here
is
wisdom
let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man
and
his
number
is
six
hundred
threescore
and
six
and
in
verse
5
of
the
same
chapter
and
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
months
french
letters
given
numerical
values
like
the
hebrew
in
which
the
first
nine
letters
represent
units
and
the
rest
tens
will
have
the
following
significance
writing
the
words
lempereur
napol233on
in
this
alphabet
of
numbers
it
turns
out
that
the
sum
of
the
figures
equals
666
and
that
napoleon
is
therefore
that
beast
prophesied
in
the
apocalypse
moreover
if
the
word
quarantedeux
that
is
the
term
fixed
for
the
beast
to
speak
great
things
and
blasphemies
is
written
in
the
same
alphabet
the
sum
of
these
figures
representing
quarantedeux
again
equals
666
from
which
it
follows
that
the
term
of
napoleons
power
was
reached
in
the
year
1812
when
the
french
emperor
turned
fortytwo
pierre
was
very
struck
by
this
prophecy
and
he
often
posed
the
question
for
himself
of
precisely
what
would
set
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
that
is
of
napoleon
and
on
the
basis
of
the
same
correspondence
of
word
numbers
and
calculations
he
tried
to
find
an
answer
to
his
question
in
answer
to
the
question
pierre
wrote
out
lempereur
alexandre
la
nation
russe
he
counted
up
the
letters
but
the
sum
of
the
numbers
came
out
much
larger
or
smaller
than
666
once
taken
up
with
these
calculations
he
wrote
his
own
namecomte
pierre
besouhoff
the
sum
of
the
numbers
was
also
far
from
the
right
one
he
changed
the
orthography
putting
z
in
place
of
s
added
de
added
the
article
le
and
still
did
not
get
the
desired
result
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
the
answer
to
the
question
he
was
seeking
was
contained
in
his
name
then
the
answer
would
certainly
mention
his
nationality
he
wrote
le
russe
besuhof
and
counting
up
the
numbers
got
671
it
was
only
five
too
much
five
was
e
the
same
e
that
was
dropped
from
the
article
in
the
words
lempereur
having
dropped
the
e
in
the
same
way
albeit
incorrectly
pierre
got
the
soughtfor
answer
lrusse
besuhof
which
equalled
666
this
discovery
excited
him
he
did
not
know
how
by
what
connection
he
was
bound
up
with
that
great
event
which
had
been
predicted
in
the
apocalypse
but
he
did
not
doubt
that
connection
for
a
moment
his
love
for
miss
rostov
the
antichrist
napoleons
invasion
the
comet
666
lempereur
napol233on
and
lrusse
besuhofall
that
together
must
ripen
burst
and
lead
him
out
of
that
spellbound
worthless
world
of
moscow
habits
in
which
he
felt
himself
imprisoned
and
bring
him
to
a
great
deed
and
great
happiness
on
the
eve
of
that
sunday
when
the
prayer
was
read
pierre
had
promised
the
rostovs
that
he
would
bring
them
from
count
rastopchin
whom
he
knew
well
both
the
appeal
to
russia
and
the
latest
news
from
the
army
in
the
morning
stopping
at
count
rastopchins
pierre
found
with
him
a
justarrived
courier
from
the
army
the
courier
was
an
acquaintance
of
pierres
from
the
moscow
ballrooms
for
gods
sake
cant
you
lighten
it
for
me
said
the
courier
ive
got
a
bag
full
of
letters
to
parents
among
those
letters
was
nikolai
rostovs
letter
to
his
father
pierre
took
it
besides
that
count
rastopchin
gave
pierre
the
sovereigns
appeal
to
moscow
only
just
printed
the
latest
orders
to
the
army
and
his
own
latest
bulletin
looking
through
the
orders
to
the
army
pierre
found
in
one
of
them
amidst
information
about
the
wounded
killed
and
decorated
the
name
of
nikolai
rostov
awarded
the
st
george
fourth
degree
for
bravery
shown
during
the
ostrovna
action
and
in
the
same
order
the
appointment
of
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
as
commander
of
a
regiment
of
chasseurs
though
he
was
reluctant
to
remind
the
rostovs
of
bolkonsky
pierre
could
not
refrain
from
his
wish
to
give
them
the
glad
news
of
their
sons
decoration
and
keeping
the
appeal
the
bulletin
and
the
other
orders
so
as
to
bring
them
to
dinner
in
person
he
sent
the
printed
order
and
the
letter
to
the
rostovs
the
conversation
with
count
rastopchin
his
preoccupied
and
hasty
tone
the
meeting
with
the
courier
who
told
casually
of
things
going
poorly
in
the
army
of
rumors
of
spies
found
in
moscow
of
a
paper
circulating
in
moscow
which
said
that
napoleon
promised
to
occupy
both
russian
capitals
before
autumn
of
talk
of
the
expected
arrival
of
the
sovereign
the
next
dayall
this
aroused
with
renewed
force
in
pierre
that
feeling
of
excitement
and
expectation
which
had
not
left
him
since
the
time
of
the
comets
appearance
and
especially
since
the
start
of
the
war
pierre
had
long
been
thinking
of
entering
military
service
and
he
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
been
hindered
first
by
his
belonging
to
the
masonic
order
to
which
he
was
bound
by
oath
and
which
preached
eternal
peace
and
the
abolition
of
war
and
second
by
looking
at
the
great
number
of
muscovites
donning
uniforms
and
preaching
patriotism
which
somehow
made
him
ashamed
to
take
such
a
step
but
the
main
reason
why
he
would
not
carry
out
his
intention
of
entering
military
service
consisted
in
his
vague
notion
that
he
lrusse
besuhof
had
the
number
of
the
beast
666
that
his
participation
in
the
great
deed
of
setting
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
that
spoke
great
things
and
blasphemies
was
predestined
from
all
eternity
and
that
he
was
therefore
not
to
undertake
anything
but
to
wait
for
what
was
to
happen
xx
at
the
rostovs
as
always
on
sundays
some
of
their
closest
acquaintances
were
dining
pierre
came
early
so
as
to
catch
them
alone
during
that
year
pierre
had
grown
so
fat
that
he
would
have
been
monstrous
if
he
had
not
been
so
tall
so
large
of
limb
and
so
strong
that
he
obviously
bore
his
corpulence
lightly
he
went
up
the
stairs
puffing
and
muttering
something
to
himself
his
coachman
no
longer
asked
if
he
should
wait
he
knew
that
when
the
count
went
to
the
rostovs
it
was
till
midnight
the
rostovs
footmen
joyfully
rushed
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak
and
take
his
stick
and
hat
from
club
habit
pierre
left
his
stick
and
hat
in
the
front
hall
the
first
person
he
saw
at
the
rostovs
was
natasha
even
before
he
saw
her
while
taking
off
his
cloak
in
the
front
hall
he
heard
her
she
was
singing
her
solfeggios
in
the
reception
room
he
knew
that
she
had
not
sung
since
the
time
of
her
illness
and
therefore
he
was
surprised
and
glad
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
he
quietly
opened
the
door
and
saw
natasha
in
her
violet
dress
which
she
had
worn
to
church
strolling
about
the
room
and
singing
she
had
her
back
to
him
when
he
opened
the
door
but
when
she
turned
abruptly
and
saw
his
fat
astonished
face
she
blushed
and
quickly
went
over
to
him
i
want
to
try
singing
again
she
said
its
something
to
do
after
all
she
added
as
if
apologizing
wonderful
how
glad
i
am
youve
come
im
so
happy
today
she
said
with
the
old
animation
which
pierre
had
not
seen
in
her
for
a
long
time
you
know
nicolas
was
awarded
the
st
george
cross

so
proud
of
him
of
course
it
was
i
who

the
order
well
i
dont
want
to
hinder

he
added
and
was
about
to
go
to
the
drawing
room
natasha
stopped
him
count
is
it
wrong
of
me
to
sing
she
said
blushing
but
gazing
at
pierre
questioningly
not
turning
her
eyes
away
nowhy
on
the
contrarybut
why
do
you
ask
me
i
dont
know
myself
natasha
replied
quickly
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
do
anything
that
you
wouldnt
like
i
trust
you
in
everything
you
dont
know
how
important
you
are
to
me
and
how
much
youve
done
for
me
she
spoke
quickly
and
did
not
notice
how
pierre
blushed
at
those
words
i
saw
in
the
same
order
that
he
bolkonsky
she
uttered
that
name
in
a
quick
whisper
is
in
russia
and
serving
again
what
do
you
think
she
said
quickly
clearly
hurrying
to
speak
because
she
feared
for
her
strength
will
he
forgive
me
someday
wont
he
always
have
an
angry
feeling
towards
me
what
do
you
think
what
do
you
think
i
think
said
pierre
theres
nothing
for
him
to
forgiveif
i
were
in
his
place
by
a
connection
of
memory
pierre
was
instantly
transported
in
imagination
to
the
time
when
in
comforting
her
he
had
told
her
that
if
he
were
not
himself
but
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
free
he
would
go
on
his
knees
and
ask
for
her
hand
and
the
same
feeling
of
pity
tenderness
and
love
came
over
him
and
the
same
words
were
on
his
lips
but
she
gave
him
no
time
to
say
them
yes
youyou
she
said
pronouncing
the
word
you
with
delight
are
a
different
matter
i
dont
know
a
man
who
is
kinder
better
more
magnanimous
than
you
and
there
cant
be
one
if
you
hadnt
been
there
then
and
now
too
i
dont
know
what
would
have
happened
to
me
because
tears
suddenly
welled
up
in
her
eyes
she
turned
away
raised
the
music
to
her
eyes
and
began
to
sing
and
pace
the
reception
room
again
just
then
petya
came
running
from
the
drawing
room
petya
was
now
a
handsome
ruddy
fifteenyearold
boy
with
plump
red
lips
and
resembled
natasha
he
was
preparing
for
the
university
but
lately
with
his
friend
obolensky
had
secretly
decided
to
join
the
hussars
petya
had
run
out
to
his
namesake
in
order
to
talk
the
matter
over
he
had
asked
him
to
find
out
whether
they
would
take
him
into
the
hussars
pierre
walked
towards
the
drawing
room
not
listening
to
petya
petya
pulled
him
by
the
arm
to
attract
his
attention

pierre
started
hunting
for
the
papers
in
his
pockets
and
could
not
find
them
continuing
to
slap
his
pockets
he
kissed
the
hand
of
the
countess
who
came
in
and
looked
around
uneasily
evidently
waiting
for
natasha
who
was
no
longer
singing
but
had
not
yet
come
to
the
drawing
room
by
god
i
dont
know
where
i
put
it
he
said
well
really
hes
forever
losing
things
said
the
countess
natasha
came
in
with
a
face
softened
by
emotion
and
sat
down
looking
silently
at
pierre
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
pierres
face
downcast
till
then
brightened
and
while
he
went
on
searching
for
the
paper
he
looked
at
her
several
times
by
god
ill
go
and
fetch
it
i
left
it
at
home

sonya
who
had
gone
to
the
front
hall
to
look
for
the
papers
had
found
them
in
pierres
hat
tucked
carefully
under
the
lining
pierre
was
about
to
start
reading
no
after
dinner
said
the
old
count
clearly
anticipating
great
pleasure
from
this
reading
over
dinner
at
which
they
drank
champagne
to
the
health
of
the
new
chevalier
of
st
george
shinshin
told
them
the
town
news
about
the
illness
of
an
old
georgian
princess
about
m233tiviers
disappearance
from
moscow
and
about
how
they
brought
some
german
to
rastopchin
and
announced
to
him
that
he
was
a
spine
so
count
rastopchin
told
it
himself
and
how
count
rastopchin
ordered
the
spine
set
free
telling
the
folk
that
he
was
not
a
spine
but
just
a
prickly
old
german
they
catch
them
they
catch
them
said
the
count
i
even
told
the
countess

kirilych
once

start
calling
up
the
militia
youll
have
to
get
on
a
horse
too
said
the
old
count
addressing
pierre
pierre
had
been
silent
and
pensive
all
through
this
dinner
as
if
not
understanding
he
looked
at
the
count
when
he
addressed
him
yes
yes
to
war
he
said
no
what
kind
of
warrior
am
i
anyhow
its
all
so
strange
so
strange
i
dont
understand
it
myself
i
dont
know
im
so
far
from
having
any
taste
for
the
military
but
nowadays
nobody
can
answer
for
himself
after
dinner
the
count
settled
comfortably
in
an
armchair
and
with
a
serious
face
asked
sonya
who
was
famous
for
her
skill
at
reading
to
read
to
our
firstthroned
capital
moscow
the
enemy
has
entered
within
the
borders
of
russia
with
great
forces
he
comes
to
devastate
our
beloved
fatherland
sonya
read
diligently
in
her
high
little
voice
the
count
listened
his
eyes
closed
sighing
fitfully
in
certain
places
natasha
sat
erect
looking
searchingly
and
directly
now
at
her
father
now
at
pierre
pierre
felt
her
gaze
on
him
and
tried
not
to
look
at
her
the
countess
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
and
crossly
at
each
solemn
phrase
of
the
manifesto
in
all
these
words
she
saw
only
that
the
dangers
which
threatened
her
son
would
not
end
soon
shinshin
composing
his
mouth
into
a
mocking
smile
was
obviously
preparing
to
mock
at
the
first
thing
that
presented
itself
for
mockery
at
sonyas
reading
at
what
the
count
would
say
even
at
the
appeal
itself
if
no
better
pretext
appeared
having
read
about
the
dangers
that
threatened
russia
about
the
hopes
the
sovereign
placed
in
moscow
and
especially
in
its
illustrious
nobility
sonya
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
caused
mainly
by
the
attention
with
which
she
was
being
listened
to
read
the
last
words
we
ourselves
will
not
be
slow
to
stand
amidst
our
people
in
that
capital
and
other
places
of
our
realm
for
consultation
and
for
the
guidance
of
all
our
armed
forces
both
those
who
already
obstruct
the
enemys
path
and
those
newly
formed
for
his
defeat
wherever
he
may
appear
may
the
ruin
to
which
he
hopes
to
reduce
us
turn
back
upon
his
own
head
and
may
a
europe
freed
from
slavery
glorify
the
name
of
russia
thats
the
way
the
count
cried
opening
his
wet
eyes
and
breaking
off
several
times
to
sniff
as
if
a
vial
of
strong
smelling
salts
had
been
put
to
his
nose
the
sovereign
need
only
say
it
and
well
sacrifice
everything
with
no
regrets
before
shinshin
had
time
to
tell
the
joke
he
had
prepared
about
the
counts
patriotism
natasha
jumped
up
from
her
place
and
ran
over
to
her
father
what
a
darling
he
is
this
papa
she
said
kissing
him
and
she
again
glanced
at
pierre
with
that
unconscious
coquetry
which
had
come
back
to
her
along
with
her
animation
theres
a
little
patriot
for
you
said
shinshin
not
a
little
patriot
at
all
but
just
natasha
replied
touchily
everythings
funny
to
you
but
this
isnt
a
joke
at
all
some
joke
the
count
repeated
he
need
only
say
the
word
and
well
all
gowere
not
some
sort
of
germans
and
did
you
notice
asked
pierre
that
it
said
for
consultation
well
whatever
its
for
just
then
petya
to
whom
no
one
paid
attention
went
up
to
his
father
and
all
red
in
a
breaking
voice
now
gruff
now
shrill
said
well
so
papa
dear
id
say
definitelyand
mama
too
like
it
or
notid
say
definitely
that
youll
let
me
go
into
military
service
because
otherwise
i
cantthats
all
the
countess
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
with
horror
clasped
her
hands
and
turned
angrily
to
her
husband
theres
your
talking
for
you
she
said
but
the
count
recovered
from
his
excitement
that
same
moment
well
well
he
said
another
warrior
forget
this
foolishness
you
must
study
its
not
foolishness
papa
fedya
obolensky
is
younger
than
i
am
and
hes
going
and
the
main
thing
is
that
anyhow
i
cant
study
anything
now
when
petya
stopped
blushed
hotly
and
managed
to
bring
out
when
the
fatherland
is
in
danger
enough
enough
its
foolishness
but
you
said
yourself
that
wed
sacrifice
everything
petya
be
quiet
im
telling
you
the
count
cried
glancing
at
his
wife
who
turning
pale
was
looking
with
fixed
eyes
at
her
younger
son
and
im
telling
you
and
pyotr
kirillovich

milk

dry
on
your
lips
and
you
want
to
serve
in
the
army
well
well
im
telling
you
and
the
count
taking
the
papers
with
him
probably
in
order
to
read
them
once
more
in
his
study
before
napping
started
out
of
the
room
pyotr
kirillovich
what
do
you
say
we
go
for
a
smoke
pierre
found
himself
in
confusion
and
irresolution
natashas
unusually
brilliant
and
animated
eyes
constantly
turning
to
him
with
more
than
affection
had
brought
him
to
that
state
no
i
think
ill
go
home
what
do
you
mean
home
you
wanted
to
spend
the
evening
with
usyou
come
rarely
as
it
is
and
this
girl
of
mine
the
count
said
goodnaturedly
pointing
to
natasha
is
only
cheerful
when
youre
here
yes
but
i
forgoti
really
must
go
homethings
to
do
pierre
said
hurriedly
well
goodbye
then
said
the
count
leaving
the
room
altogether
why
are
you
going
why
are
you
upset
why
natasha
asked
pierre
looking
challengingly
into
his
eyes
because
i
love
you
he
wanted
to
say
but
he
did
not
say
it
blushed
to
the
point
of
tears
and
lowered
his
eyes
because
its
better
that
i
visit
you
less
oftenbecauseno
i
simply
have
things
to
do
but
why
no
tell
me
natasha
began
resolutely
and
suddenly
fell
silent
they
both
looked
at
each
other
in
fright
and
confusion
he
tried
to
smile
but
could
not
his
smile
expressed
suffering
and
he
silently
kissed
her
hand
and
left
pierre
decided
to
himself
that
he
would
not
visit
the
rostovs
anymore
xxi
after
the
resolute
refusal
he
had
received
petya
went
to
his
room
and
locking
himself
in
wept
bitterly
everyone
pretended
to
notice
nothing
when
he
came
to
tea
silent
and
gloomy
with
tearful
eyes
the
next
day
the
sovereign
arrived
several
of
the
rostovs
domestics
asked
permission
to
go
and
look
at
the
tsar
that
morning
petya
spent
a
long
time
getting
dressed
combing
his
hair
and
arranging
his
collar
the
way
grownups
do
he
frowned
into
the
mirror
gesticulated
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
finally
without
telling
anyone
put
on
his
peaked
cap
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
door
trying
not
to
be
noticed
petya
had
decided
to
go
directly
to
the
place
where
the
sovereign
was
and
explain
directly
to
some
gentlemaninwaiting
petya
thought
that
a
sovereign
was
always
surrounded
by
gentlemeninwaiting
that
he
count
rostov
despite
his
youth
wished
to
serve
the
fatherland
that
youth
could
be
no
hindrance
to
devotion
and
that
he
was
preparedwhile
getting
ready
to
go
petya
had
prepared
many
fine
words
which
he
would
say
to
the
gentlemaninwaiting
petya
was
counting
on
the
success
of
his
undertaking
precisely
because
he
was
a
child
petya
even
thought
how
everyone
would
be
astonished
at
his
youth
and
yet
in
the
arrangement
of
his
collar
in
his
hairstyle
and
in
his
slow
sedate
walk
he
wanted
to
make
himself
look
like
an
old
man
but
the
further
he
went
the
more
distracted
he
was
by
the
everincreasing
numbers
of
people
near
the
kremlin
the
more
he
forgot
to
maintain
the
slowness
and
sedateness
proper
to
grownup
people
as
he
approached
the
kremlin
he
already
began
to
worry
about
being
jostled
and
with
a
menacing
look
he
resolutely
stuck
out
his
elbows
but
at
the
trinity
gate
in
spite
of
all
his
resoluteness
people
who
probably
did
not
know
with
what
a
patriotic
purpose
he
was
going
to
the
kremlin
so
pressed
him
to
the
wall
that
he
had
to
submit
and
stop
while
carriages
passed
under
the
archway
with
a
hollow
rumble
next
to
petya
stood
a
peasant
woman
a
footman
two
merchants
and
a
retired
soldier
after
standing
for
a
while
in
the
gateway
petya
unwilling
to
wait
until
all
the
carriages
went
by
wanted
to
start
moving
ahead
before
the
others
and
resolutely
began
to
work
with
his
elbows
but
the
peasant
woman
standing
in
his
way
to
whom
he
first
applied
his
elbows
angrily
shouted
at
him
what
are
you
shoving
for
little
master
see
everybodys
standing
whats
all
this
pushing
for
anybody
can
push
in
that
case
said
the
footman
and
also
beginning
to
work
with
his
elbows
he
squeezed
petya
into
the
stinking
corner
of
the
gateway
petya
wiped
his
sweatcovered
face
with
his
hands
and
straightened
the
sweatsoaked
collar
he
had
arranged
so
well
like
a
grownups
at
home
petya
felt
that
he
looked
unpresentable
and
was
afraid
that
if
he
appeared
before
the
gentlemeninwaiting
like
that
he
would
not
be
admitted
to
the
sovereign
but
owing
to
the
crowd
it
was
quite
impossible
to
set
himself
right
and
move
to
another
place
one
of
the
generals
driving
by
was
an
acquaintance
of
the
rostovs
petya
wanted
to
ask
for
his
help
but
considered
that
it
would
be
unmanly
when
all
the
carriages
had
gone
past
the
crowd
poured
through
and
brought
petya
out
on
the
square
which
was
all
filled
with
people
not
only
on
the
square
but
on
the
glacis
on
the
roofs
everywhere
there
were
people
as
soon
as
petya
found
himself
on
the
square
he
clearly
heard
the
sounds
of
the
bells
and
the
joyful
talk
of
people
that
filled
the
whole
kremlin
for
a
time
the
square
was
less
crowded
but
suddenly
all
heads
were
uncovered
everyone
rushed
forward
somewhere
petya
was
pressed
so
hard
that
he
could
not
breathe
and
everyone
shouted
hurrah
hurrrah
hurrah
petya
stood
on
tiptoe
shoved
pinched
but
could
see
nothing
except
the
people
around
him
on
all
faces
there
was
the
same
general
expression
of
tenderness
and
rapture
a
merchant
woman
standing
beside
petya
sobbed
and
tears
poured
from
her
eyes
father
angel
dearest
she
murmured
wiping
her
tears
with
her
fingers
hurrah
came
from
all
sides
for
a
moment
the
crowd
stood
in
one
place
but
then
again
it
rushed
forward
petya
forgetting
himself
clenched
his
teeth
rolled
his
eyes
out
wildly
and
rushed
forward
working
with
his
elbows
and
shouting
hurrah
as
if
he
was
ready
to
kill
himself
and
everyone
else
at
that
moment
but
exactly
the
same
wild
faces
came
at
him
from
the
sides
with
the
same
shouts
of
hurrah
so
this
is
what
the
sovereign
is
petya
thought
no
its
impossible
for
me
to
hand
him
a
petition
myself
its
too
bold
in
spite
of
which
he
made
his
way
forward
just
as
desperately
and
saw
flashing
between
the
backs
of
those
ahead
of
him
an
empty
space
and
a
passage
laid
with
red
cloth
but
just
then
the
crowd
heaved
backwards
the
policemen
ahead
shoved
back
those
who
got
too
close
to
the
procession
the
sovereign
passed
from
the
palace
to
the
cathedral
of
the
dormition
and
petya
unexpectedly
received
such
a
blow
in
the
ribs
from
the
side
and
was
so
squeezed
that
everything
suddenly
went
dim
in
his
eyes
and
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
came
to
some
clergyman
with
a
clump
of
graying
hair
tied
behind
in
a
shabby
blue
cassock
probably
a
beadle
was
holding
him
under
the
arm
with
one
hand
and
protecting
him
from
the
pressing
crowd
with
the
other
the
young
gentleman
has
been
crushed
the
beadle
was
saying
such
goings
onease
uphes
crushed
crushed
the
sovereign
went
into
the
cathedral
of
the
dormition
the
crowd
subsided
again
and
the
beadle
led
petya
pale
and
barely
breathing
to
the
tsarcannon
several
persons
felt
sorry
for
petya
and
suddenly
the
whole
crowd
turned
to
him
and
now
there
was
a
crush
around
him
those
who
stood
near
attended
to
him
unbuttoned
his
frock
coat
sat
him
up
on
the
cannon
and
reproached
somebodywhoever
had
crushed
him
you
could
crush
somebody
to
death
that
way
what
is
it
committing
murder
see
the
dear
heart
hes
gone
white
as
a
sheet
voices
said
petya
soon
recovered
the
color
returned
to
his
face
the
pain
disappeared
and
for
this
temporary
unpleasantness
he
acquired
a
place
on
the
cannon
from
which
he
hoped
to
see
the
sovereign
who
should
be
coming
back
that
way
petya
was
no
longer
thinking
of
petitioning
if
only
he
could
see
him
he
would
consider
himself
happy
during
the
service
in
the
cathedral
of
the
dormitionwhich
was
a
combined
prayer
service
on
the
occasion
of
the
sovereigns
arrival
and
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
for
the
concluding
of
peace
with
the
turksthe
crowd
spread
out
hawkers
appeared
offering
kvass
gingerbread
poppyseed
cakes
which
petya
especially
fancied
and
ordinary
conversations
were
heard
one
merchants
wife
displayed
her
torn
shawl
telling
how
much
she
had
paid
for
it
another
said
that
today
all
silk
fabrics
had
become
expensive
the
beadle
petyas
savior
talked
with
an
official
about
just
who
and
who
were
serving
that
day
with
the
bishop
the
beadle
several
times
repeated
the
word
concelebration
which
petya
did
not
understand
two
young
tradesmen
bantered
with
servant
girls
who
were
cracking
nuts
all
this
talk
especially
the
bantering
with
the
girls
which
for
a
boy
of
petyas
age
was
especially
alluring
all
this
talk
did
not
concern
petya
now
he
sat
on
his
lofty
cannon
as
excited
as
ever
at
the
thought
of
the
sovereign
and
of
his
love
for
him
the
feeling
of
pain
and
fear
when
he
was
being
crushed
blended
with
the
feeling
of
rapture
and
increased
in
him
still
more
the
awareness
of
the
importance
of
this
moment
suddenly
cannon
shots
were
heard
from
the
embankment
the
shooting
was
in
celebration
of
the
peace
with
the
turks
and
the
crowd
swiftly
rushed
to
the
embankment
to
watch
how
they
were
shooting
petya
also
wanted
to
run
there
but
the
beadle
having
taken
the
young
gentleman
under
his
protection
would
not
let
him
the
shooting
was
still
going
on
when
officers
generals
gentlemeninwaiting
came
running
out
of
the
cathedral
then
others
came
out
less
hurriedly
then
hats
were
taken
off
again
and
those
who
had
run
to
look
at
the
cannon
came
running
back
finally
four
more
men
in
uniforms
and
sashes
came
through
the
doors
of
the
cathedral
hurrah
hurrah
the
crowd
shouted
again
which
is
he
which
is
he
petya
asked
all
around
in
a
tearful
voice
but
no
one
answered
him
they
were
all
too
carried
away
and
petya
having
selected
one
of
these
four
persons
whom
he
could
not
make
out
clearly
because
of
the
tears
of
joy
that
welled
up
in
his
eyes
concentrated
all
his
rapture
on
him
though
he
was
not
the
sovereign
shouted
hurrah
in
a
frantic
voice
and
decided
that
tomorrow
whatever
it
might
cost
him
he
would
be
in
the
military
the
crowd
ran
after
the
sovereign
accompanied
him
to
the
palace
and
began
to
disperse
it
was
already
late
petya
had
eaten
nothing
he
was
streaming
with
sweat
but
he
would
not
go
home
and
together
with
the
diminished
but
still
quite
large
crowd
stood
before
the
palace
looking
through
the
palace
windows
while
the
sovereign
dined
expecting
something
further
and
equally
envious
both
of
the
dignitaries
who
drove
up
to
the
entrance
to
the
sovereigns
dinner
and
of
the
palace
footmen
who
served
at
the
table
and
flitted
past
the
windows
at
dinner
with
the
sovereign
valuev
said
glancing
out
the
window
the
people
still
hope
to
see
your
majesty
the
dinner
was
already
over
the
sovereign
stood
up
and
finishing
a
biscuit
went
out
to
the
balcony
the
people
with
petya
among
them
rushed
to
the
balcony
angel
father
hurrah
dearest
cried
the
people
and
petya
and
again
peasant
women
and
a
few
men
of
the
weaker
sort
including
petya
wept
with
happiness
a
rather
large
piece
of
the
biscuit
that
the
sovereign
was
holding
broke
off
fell
onto
the
railing
of
the
balcony
and
from
there
to
the
ground
a
cabby
in
a
jerkin
who
was
standing
closest
of
all
rushed
to
this
piece
of
biscuit
and
snatched
it
up
some
people
in
the
crowd
rushed
to
the
cabby
noticing
that
the
sovereign
asked
for
a
plate
of
biscuits
to
be
brought
and
began
tossing
biscuits
from
the
balcony
petyas
eyes
became
bloodshot
the
danger
of
being
crushed
aroused
him
still
more
he
rushed
for
the
biscuits
he
did
not
know
why
but
it
was
necessary
to
take
a
biscuit
from
the
tsars
hands
and
necessary
not
to
give
it
up
he
rushed
and
tripped
up
a
little
old
woman
who
was
trying
to
catch
a
biscuit
but
the
little
old
woman
did
not
consider
herself
defeated
though
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
she
tried
to
catch
a
biscuit
but
kept
missing
petya
knocked
her
arm
aside
with
his
knee
snatched
a
biscuit
and
as
if
afraid
to
be
late
again
shouted
hurrah
in
a
voice
now
grown
hoarse
the
sovereign
went
in
and
after
that
the
greater
the
people
began
to
disperse
see
i
said
to
keep
waitingand
i
was
right
people
said
joyfully
from
various
sides
happy
as
petya
was
he
still
felt
sad
to
go
home
and
know
that
all
the
pleasure
of
that
day
was
over
from
the
kremlin
petya
did
not
go
home
but
to
his
friend
obolensky
who
was
also
fifteen
and
who
also
wanted
to
join
a
regiment
returning
home
he
announced
resolutely
and
firmly
that
if
they
would
not
let
him
he
would
run
away
and
the
next
day
count
ilya
andreich
though
not
yet
quite
giving
in
went
to
find
out
how
he
could
arrange
to
set
petya
up
in
some
less
dangerous
place
xxii
on
the
fifteenth
in
the
morning
the
third
day
after
that
a
countless
number
of
carriages
stood
by
the
slobodsky
palace
the
great
halls
were
filled
in
the
first
were
noblemen
in
uniforms
in
the
second
merchants
with
medals
in
beards
and
dark
blue
kaftans
in
the
hall
of
the
assembly
of
the
nobility
there
was
noise
and
movement
the
most
important
dignitaries
sat
on
highbacked
chairs
around
a
large
table
under
a
portrait
of
the
sovereign
but
the
majority
walked
about
the
room
all
the
nobility
the
same
ones
pierre
saw
every
day
now
in
the
club
now
in
their
homes
were
in
uniforms
some
of
catherines
time
some
of
pauls
some
in
new
ones
of
alexanders
time
some
in
generic
noblemens
uniforms
and
this
general
character
of
the
uniform
lent
something
strange
and
fantastic
to
these
old
and
young
most
diverse
and
familiar
faces
especially
striking
were
the
old
men
weaksighted
toothless
bald
swollen
with
yellow
fat
or
shriveled
gaunt
for
the
most
sat
silently
in
their
places
and
if
they
walked
and
talked
they
attached
themselves
to
someone
younger
just
as
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
petya
had
seen
in
the
square
so
on
all
these
faces
there
was
a
striking
feature
of
contrast
a
general
expectation
of
something
solemn
and
the
ordinary
and
everydaya
game
of
boston
petrushka
the
cook
zina239da
dmitrievnas
health
and
so
on
pierre
squeezed
since
morning
into
an
uncomfortable
noblemans
uniform
which
had
become
too
tight
for
him
was
there
in
the
halls
he
was
excited
the
extraordinary
assembly
not
only
of
noblemen
but
of
merchants
as
wellof
estates
233tats
g233n233rauxcalled
up
in
him
a
whole
series
of
thoughts
long
abandoned
but
deeply
imprinted
in
his
soul
about
the
contrat
social
and
the
french
revolution
the
words
he
had
noticed
in
the
appeal
that
the
sovereign
would
come
to
the
capital
for
consultations
with
his
people
confirmed
him
in
this
view
and
supposing
that
something
important
in
that
sense
was
approaching
something
he
had
long
awaited
he
walked
about
observed
listened
to
what
was
said
but
did
not
find
anywhere
an
expression
of
those
thoughts
that
interested
him
the
sovereigns
manifesto
was
read
evoked
raptures
and
then
everyone
wandered
about
talking
besides
ordinary
interests
pierre
heard
talk
of
where
the
marshals
of
the
nobility
were
to
stand
when
the
sovereign
entered
when
to
give
the
ball
for
the
sovereign
whether
it
should
be
done
by
districts
or
by
the
whole
provinceand
so
on
but
as
soon
as
things
touched
on
the
war
and
what
the
nobility
had
assembled
for
the
talk
became
indecisive
and
indefinite
everyone
wished
more
to
listen
than
to
speak
a
middleaged
man
manly
handsome
in
the
uniform
of
a
retired
naval
officer
spoke
in
one
of
the
halls
and
a
crowd
formed
around
him
pierre
went
over
to
the
circle
around
the
speaker
and
began
to
listen
count
ilya
andreich
in
his
kaftan
of
a
governor
from
catherines
time
who
was
strolling
with
a
pleasant
smile
among
the
crowd
with
all
of
whom
he
was
acquainted
also
went
over
to
this
group
and
began
listening
with
his
kindly
smile
as
he
always
did
nodding
approvingly
to
indicate
his
agreement
with
the
speaker
the
retired
naval
officer
was
speaking
very
boldly
that
was
evident
from
the
expression
of
the
faces
of
his
listeners
and
from
the
fact
that
people
known
to
pierre
as
most
submissive
and
quiet
objected
or
walked
away
from
him
disapprovingly
pierre
pushed
his
way
to
the
middle
of
the
circle
listened
and
became
convinced
that
the
man
speaking
was
indeed
a
liberal
but
in
quite
a
different
sense
than
pierre
had
thought
the
naval
officer
spoke
in
that
especially
resounding
melodious
noblemans
baritone
pleasantly
swallowing
his
rs
and
dropping
consonants
that
voice
in
which
one
calls
out
youtheah
a
pipe
and
the
like
he
spoke
with
a
voice
accustomed
to
both
revelry
and
authority
so
what
if
smolensk
has
offered
the
sovn
a
militiah
does
smolensk
lay
down
the
law
for
us
if
the
honable
nobility
of
moscow
province
find
it
necessary
they
can
show
their
devotion
to
the
sovn
emprah
some
othah
way
weve
not
forgotten
the
militiah
of
the
year
seven
the
only
ones
who
profited
from
it
were
little
church
folk
and
thieving
robbahs
count
ilya
andreich
smiling
sweetly
nodded
his
head
approvingly
and
was
our
militiah
of
any
use
to
the
country
none
at
all
it
just
ruined
our
husbandry
conscriptions
betterbecause
when
they
come
back
theyre
not
soldiers
not
peasants
theyre
sheer
depravity
the
nobility
wont
spare
their
own
lives
well
go
ourselves
to
the
last
man
well
conscript
more
soldiers
and
the
sovn
that
was
how
he
said
sovereign
only
needs
to
sound
the
call
and
well
all
die
for
him
the
orator
added
with
inspiration
ilya
andreich
gulped
with
pleasure
and
nudged
pierre
but
pierre
also
wanted
to
speak
he
moved
forward
feeling
inspired
not
knowing
by
what
himself
and
not
knowing
himself
what
he
was
going
to
say
he
had
only
just
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
when
one
senator
completely
toothless
with
an
intelligent
and
angry
face
who
was
standing
near
the
orator
interrupted
pierre
with
an
obvious
habit
of
leading
the
debate
and
sustaining
questions
he
spoke
softly
but
audibly
i
suppose
my
dear
sir
said
the
senator
maundering
with
his
toothless
mouth
that
we
have
been
summoned
here
not
in
order
to
discuss
what
is
more
appropriate
for
the
country
at
the
present
momentconscription
or
a
militia
we
have
been
summoned
to
respond
to
the
appeal
the
sovereign
has
deigned
to
make
to
us
and
we
can
let
higher
authorities
judge
which
is
more
opportuneconscription
or
a
militia
pierre
suddenly
found
an
outlet
for
his
inspiration
he
rose
up
against
the
senator
who
had
introduced
this
correctness
and
narrowness
of
view
into
the
tasks
facing
the
nobility
pierre
stepped
forward
and
stopped
him
he
did
not
know
himself
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
he
began
with
animation
from
time
to
time
breaking
into
french
words
and
expressing
himself
bookishly
in
russian
excuse
me
your
excellency
he
began
pierre
knew
this
senator
well
but
considered
it
necessary
here
to
address
him
officially
though
i
do
not
agree
with
the
gentleman
pierre
hesitated
he
wanted
to
say
mon
tr232s
honorable
pr233opinant
with
the
gentlemanque
je
nai
pas
lhonneur
de
conna238tre
but
i
suppose
that
the
estate
of
the
nobility
besides
expressing
its
sympathy
and
delight
has
also
been
summoned
to
discuss
the
measures
by
which
we
may
help
the
fatherland
i
suppose
he
said
becoming
inspired
that
the
sovereign
himself
would
be
displeased
if
he
were
to
find
in
us
only
owners
of
peasants
whom
we
give
to
him
andchair
224
canon
which
we
make
of
ourselves
and
did
not
find
in
us
any
cococounsel
many
walked
away
from
the
circle
seeing
the
senators
contemptuous
smile
and
that
pierre
was
speaking
liberally
only
ilya
andreich
was
pleased
with
pierres
speech
as
he
had
been
pleased
with
the
speech
of
the
naval
officer
the
senator
and
generally
always
with
the
speech
he
had
heard
last
i
suppose
that
before
discussing
these
questions
pierre
went
on
we
should
ask
the
sovereign
most
respectfully
ask
his
majesty
to
communicate
to
us
how
many
troops
we
have
in
what
position
our
troops
and
the
army
find
themselves
and
then
but
pierre
had
not
managed
to
finish
these
words
when
he
was
suddenly
attacked
from
three
sides
the
strongest
attack
came
from
his
old
acquaintance
the
boston
player
stepan
stepanovich
apraksin
who
had
always
been
welldisposed
towards
him
stepan
stepanovich
was
wearing
a
uniform
and
either
because
of
the
uniform
or
for
some
other
reason
pierre
saw
a
completely
different
person
before
him
with
an
old
mans
anger
suddenly
showing
on
his
face
stepan
stepanovich
shouted
at
pierre
first
i
put
it
to
you
that
we
have
no
right
to
ask
that
of
the
sovereign
and
second
if
the
russian
nobility
did
have
that
right
the
sovereign
could
not
answer
us

another
voice
of
a
man
of
medium
height
about
forty
years
old
whom
pierre
in
the
old
days
used
to
see
at
the
gypsies
and
knew
for
a
dishonest
cardplayer
and
who
also
changed
by
his
uniform
moving
closer
to
pierre
interrupted
apraksin
and
this
is
not
the
time
for
debate
said
the
voice
of
this
nobleman
we
must
act
theres
war
in
russia
the
enemy
is
coming
to
destroy
russia
to
defile
the
graves
of
our
fathers
to
carry
off
our
wives
and
children
the
nobleman
beat
his
chest
well
all
stand
up
well
all
go
to
the
last
man
for
our
dearest
tsar
he
cried
rolling
his
bloodshot
eyes
several
approving
voices
were
heard
in
the
crowd
were
russian
and
we
wont
spare
our
blood
to
defend
the
faith
the
throne
and
the
fatherland
and
the
raving
has
to
stop
if
we
are
sons
of
the
fatherland
well
show
europe
how
russia
rises
to
defend
russia
cried
the
nobleman
pierre
wanted
to
object
but
could
not
say
a
word
he
felt
that
the
sound
of
his
words
regardless
of
the
thought
they
contained
would
be
heard
less
than
the
sound
of
the
animated
noblemans
words
ilya
andreich
approved
from
outside
the
circle
some
briskly
turned
their
shoulders
to
the
orator
at
the
end
of
each
phrase
and
said
right
right
thats
right
pierre
wanted
to
say
that
he
did
not
mind
donating
money
or
peasants
or
sacrificing
himself
but
that
it
was
necessary
to
know
the
state
of
affairs
in
order
to
help
in
any
way
but
he
could
not
speak
many
voices
shouted
and
talked
all
at
once
so
that
ilya
andreich
had
no
time
to
nod
to
them
all
and
the
group
grew
in
numbers
broke
up
came
together
again
and
moved
with
a
buzz
of
voices
to
the
large
hall
to
the
large
table
pierre
not
only
had
not
succeeded
in
speaking
he
had
been
rudely
interrupted
pushed
aside
turned
away
from
as
a
common
enemy
this
had
happened
not
because
they
were
displeased
with
the
meaning
of
what
he
saidthat
had
been
forgotten
after
the
great
number
of
speeches
that
followed
itbut
because
for
inspiration
a
crowd
needs
to
have
a
tangible
object
of
love
and
a
tangible
object
of
hatred
pierre
had
become
the
latter
many
orators
spoke
after
the
animated
nobleman
and
they
all
spoke
in
the
same
vein
many
spoke
beautifully
and
originally
the
editor
of
the
russian
messenger
glinka
who
was
recognized
the
writer
the
writer
came
from
the
crowd
said
that
hell
should
be
repulsed
by
hell
and
that
he
had
seen
a
child
smile
at
lightning
flashes
and
thunderclaps
but
that
we
were
not
going
to
be
that
child
yes
yes
at
thunderclaps
was
repeated
approvingly
from
the
back
rows
the
crowd
came
to
the
large
table
at
which
sat
the
seventyyearold
dignitaries
in
their
uniforms
and
sashes
grayhaired
and
bald
almost
all
of
whom
pierre
had
seen
in
their
homes
with
their
buffoons
and
in
the
clubs
over
boston
the
crowd
came
to
the
table
not
ceasing
to
buzz
one
after
another
and
sometimes
two
together
pressed
up
against
the
high
backs
of
the
chairs
by
the
pushing
crowd
behind
the
orators
spoke
those
standing
behind
noticed
the
things
that
the
orator
did
not
say
and
hastened
to
say
them
others
in
that
heat
and
closeness
racked
their
brains
in
search
of
some
sort
of
thought
and
hastily
spoke
it
the
old
dignitaries
whom
pierre
knew
sat
and
glanced
now
at
one
now
at
another
and
their
expression
for
the
most
only
that
they
found
it
very
hot
pierre
however
felt
excited
and
the
general
sense
of
a
wish
to
show
that
it
was
all
nothing
to
us
which
was
manifested
more
in
sounds
and
facial
expressions
than
in
the
meaning
of
their
speeches
communicated
itself
to
him
as
well
he
did
not
renounce
his
thoughts
but
he
felt
guilty
of
something
and
wanted
to
vindicate
himself
i
only
said
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
if
we
made
donations
when
we
know
whats
needed
he
said
trying
to
outshout
the
other
voices
the
nearest
little
old
man
glanced
around
at
him
but
was
at
once
distracted
by
shouting
that
started
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
yes
moscow
will
be
surrendered
she
will
be
our
redeemer
shouted
one
hes
the
enemy
of
mankind
shouted
another
allow
me
to
speakgentlemen
youre
crushing
me
xxiii
just
then
stepping
briskly
through
the
parting
crowd
of
noblemen
in
a
generals
uniform
with
a
sash
over
his
shoulder
with
his
protruding
chin
and
darting
eyes
count
rastopchin
came
in
the
sovereign
emperor
will
be
here
presently
said
rastopchin
ive
just
come
from
there
i
suppose
that
in
the
position
in
which
we
find
ourselves
there
is
not
much
to
discuss
the
sovereign
has
deigned
to
assemble
us
and
the
merchants
said
count
rastopchin
millions
will
pour
from
there
he
pointed
to
the
merchants
hall
and
our
task
is
to
raise
a
militia
and
not
spare
ourselvesthat
is
the
least
we
can
do
deliberations
began
among
the
dignitaries
sitting
at
the
table
the
deliberations
all
went
more
than
quietly
it
even
seemed
sad
when
after
all
the
previous
noise
the
old
voices
were
heard
singly
one
saying
i
agree
and
another
for
the
sake
of
variety
and
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
and
so
on
the
secretary
was
told
to
write
down
the
resolution
of
the
moscow
nobility
that
the
muscovites
like
the
people
of
smolensk
would
donate
ten
men
per
thousand
with
full
equipment
the
gentlemen
of
the
session
stood
up
as
if
relieved
scraping
their
chairs
and
walked
about
the
hall
to
stretch
their
legs
some
arm
in
arm
and
talking
the
sovereign
the
sovereign
suddenly
spread
through
the
hall
and
the
entire
crowd
rushed
to
the
door
down
a
wide
passage
between
walls
of
noblemen
the
sovereign
came
into
the
hall
a
respectful
and
frightened
curiosity
was
expressed
on
all
faces
pierre
was
standing
rather
far
away
and
could
not
hear
all
that
the
sovereign
said
from
what
he
did
hear
he
understood
only
that
the
sovereign
was
speaking
of
the
danger
the
country
was
in
and
of
the
hopes
he
placed
in
the
moscow
nobility
another
voice
responded
to
the
sovereign
telling
of
the
resolution
just
arrived
at
by
the
moscow
nobility
gentlemen
said
the
faltering
voice
of
the
sovereign
the
crowd
rustled
and
grew
still
again
and
pierre
clearly
heard
the
sovereigns
voice
so
pleasantly
human
and
touched
with
emotion
saying
i
have
never
doubted
the
zeal
of
the
russian
nobility
but
today
it
has
exceeded
my
expectations
i
thank
you
on
behalf
of
the
fatherland
gentlemen
let
us
acttime
is
most
precious
the
sovereign
fell
silent
the
crowd
began
to
press
around
him
and
rapturous
exclamations
were
heard
on
all
sides
yes
most
preciousspoken
like
a
tsar
the
sobbing
voice
of
ilya
andreich
said
from
behind
he
had
heard
nothing
but
had
understood
it
all
in
his
own
way
from
the
hall
of
the
nobility
the
sovereign
passed
into
the
hall
of
the
merchants
he
stayed
there
for
about
ten
minutes
pierre
among
others
saw
the
sovereign
come
out
of
the
merchants
hall
with
tears
of
tenderness
in
his
eyes
as
was
learned
later
the
sovereign
had
just
begun
his
speech
to
the
merchants
when
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
he
had
finished
it
in
a
trembling
voice
when
pierre
saw
the
sovereign
he
was
coming
out
accompanied
by
two
merchants
one
was
a
fat
tax
farmer
known
to
pierre
the
other
a
mayor
with
a
thin
narrowbearded
yellow
face
both
were
weeping
the
thin
ones
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
but
the
fat
tax
farmer
sobbed
like
a
child
and
kept
insisting
take
my
life
and
my
property
your
majesty
pierre
had
no
other
feelings
at
that
moment
except
the
desire
to
show
that
it
was
all
nothing
to
him
and
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
he
saw
his
speech
with
its
constitutional
tendency
as
a
reproach
to
himself
he
sought
an
occasion
to
smooth
it
over
learning
that
count
mamonov
had
donated
a
regiment
bezukhov
at
once
declared
to
count
rastopchin
that
he
was
giving
a
thousand
men
and
their
maintenance
old
rostov
could
not
tell
his
wife
what
had
happened
without
tears
and
at
once
agreed
to
petyas
demand
and
went
himself
to
sign
him
up
the
sovereign
left
the
next
day
all
the
assembled
noblemen
took
off
their
uniforms
planted
themselves
at
home
or
in
the
clubs
again
and
groaning
gave
their
stewards
orders
about
the
militia
astonished
at
what
they
had
done
i
napoleon
started
the
war
with
russia
because
he
could
not
help
going
to
dresden
could
not
help
getting
befuddled
with
honors
could
not
help
putting
on
a
polish
uniform
yielding
to
the
heartening
impression
of
a
june
morning
could
not
refrain
from
outbursts
of
anger
in
the
presence
of
kurakin
and
then
of
balashov
alexander
refused
all
negotiations
because
he
felt
himself
personally
offended
barclay
de
tolly
tried
to
lead
his
army
in
the
best
fashion
so
as
to
fulfill
his
duty
and
earn
the
glory
of
a
great
general
rostov
rode
to
the
attack
against
the
french
because
he
could
not
resist
the
wish
to
go
galloping
across
a
level
field
and
all
the
countless
persons
who
participated
in
this
war
acted
in
just
the
same
way
as
a
result
of
their
personal
qualities
habits
conditions
and
aims
they
feared
boasted
rejoiced
resented
reasoned
supposing
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
that
they
were
doing
it
for
themselves
and
yet
they
were
all
involuntary
instruments
of
history
and
performed
work
hidden
from
them
but
comprehensible
to
us
such
is
the
inevitable
fate
of
all
men
of
action
and
the
higher
they
stand
in
the
human
hierarchy
the
less
free
they
are
now
all
the
active
figures
of
the
year
1812
have
long
left
their
places
their
personal
interests
have
vanished
without
a
trace
and
only
the
historical
results
of
that
time
stand
before
us
but
assume
that
the
people
of
europe
led
by
napoleon
had
to
go
into
the
depths
of
russia
and
perish
there
and
all
the
selfcontradictory
senseless
cruel
activity
of
the
people
who
participated
in
this
war
becomes
comprehensible
to
us
providence
made
all
these
people
while
striving
to
achieve
their
personal
aims
contribute
to
the
fulfillment
of
one
enormous
result
of
which
not
one
man
neither
napoleon
nor
alexander
still
less
any
of
the
participants
in
the
war
had
the
least
expectation
it
is
now
clear
to
us
what
in
the
year
1812
was
the
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
french
army
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
cause
of
the
destruction
of
napoleons
french
forces
was
on
the
one
hand
their
advance
late
in
the
year
without
preparations
for
a
winter
march
into
the
depths
of
russia
and
on
the
other
hand
the
character
that
the
war
took
on
with
the
burning
of
russian
towns
and
the
hatred
of
the
foe
aroused
in
the
russian
people
but
then
not
only
did
no
one
foresee
what
now
seems
obvious
that
this
was
the
only
way
that
could
lead
to
the
destruction
of
an
army
of
eight
hundred
thousand
men
the
best
in
the
world
and
led
by
the
best
of
generals
in
conflict
with
a
twice
weaker
russian
army
inexperienced
and
led
by
inexperienced
generals
not
only
did
no
one
foresee
this
but
all
efforts
on
the
the
russians
were
constantly
aimed
at
hindering
the
one
thing
that
could
save
russia
and
on
the
the
french
despite
napoleons
experience
and
socalled
military
genius
all
efforts
were
aimed
at
extending
as
far
as
moscow
by
the
end
of
summer
that
is
at
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
to
destroy
them
in
historical
writings
about
the
year
1812
french
authors
like
very
much
to
speak
of
how
napoleon
sensed
the
danger
of
extending
his
line
how
he
sought
a
battle
how
his
marshals
advised
him
to
stop
at
smolensk
and
to
bring
forth
other
similar
arguments
to
prove
that
even
then
the
danger
of
the
campaign
was
supposedly
understood
and
russian
authors
like
still
more
to
speak
of
how
from
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
there
existed
a
scythian
war
plan
of
luring
napoleon
into
the
depths
of
russia
and
one
ascribes
this
plan
to
pfuel
another
to
some
frenchman
another
to
toll
another
to
the
emperor
alexander
himself
pointing
to
reports
projects
and
letters
that
indeed
contain
hints
at
such
a
way
of
action
but
all
these
hints
at
the
foreseeing
of
what
happened
both
on
the
the
french
and
on
the
the
russians
are
now
put
forward
only
because
events
justified
them
if
the
events
had
not
occurred
those
hints
would
have
been
forgotten
as
thousands
and
millions
of
contrary
hints
and
suppositions
that
were
current
then
but
turned
out
to
be
incorrect
are
now
forgotten
there
are
always
so
many
suppositions
about
the
outcome
of
every
event
which
takes
place
that
however
it
ends
people
will
always
be
found
who
say
i
said
back
then
that
it
would
be
like
this
quite
forgetting
that
among
the
numberless
suppositions
there
were
some
that
were
completely
contrary
the
suppositions
about
napoleons
awareness
of
the
danger
of
extending
his
line
and
on
the
russian
side
about
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
russia
obviously
belong
to
this
category
and
it
is
only
by
greatly
stretching
a
point
that
historians
can
ascribe
such
considerations
to
napoleon
and
his
marshals
and
such
plans
to
the
russian
commanders
all
the
facts
completely
contradict
such
suppositions
not
only
was
there
no
wish
on
the
russian
side
during
the
whole
time
of
the
war
to
lure
the
french
into
the
depths
of
russia
but
everything
was
done
to
stop
them
from
the
moment
of
their
entry
into
russia
and
not
only
was
napoleon
not
afraid
of
extending
his
line
but
he
rejoiced
as
at
a
triumph
at
his
every
step
forward
and
was
very
lazy
not
as
in
his
previous
campaigns
in
seeking
a
battle
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
campaign
our
armies
are
cut
in
two
and
the
one
goal
we
aim
at
consists
in
reuniting
them
though
for
retreating
and
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
the
country
uniting
the
armies
is
not
advantageous
the
emperor
is
with
the
army
to
inspire
it
to
defend
every
step
of
russian
soil
and
not
to
retreat
the
enormous
camp
on
the
drissa
is
set
up
according
to
pfuels
plan
with
no
intention
of
retreating
further
the
sovereign
reproaches
the
commanders
in
chief
for
every
step
in
retreat
not
only
the
burning
of
moscow
but
even
the
enemys
advance
as
far
as
smolensk
cannot
present
itself
to
the
emperors
imagination
and
when
the
armies
unite
the
sovereign
is
indignant
that
smolensk
is
taken
and
burned
and
no
general
battle
is
given
before
its
walls
so
thinks
the
sovereign
but
the
russian
commanders
and
all
russian
people
are
still
more
indignant
at
the
thought
that
our
forces
are
retreating
into
the
depths
of
the
country
napoleon
having
cut
our
armies
in
two
moves
into
the
depths
of
the
country
and
lets
slip
several
chances
for
battle
in
the
month
of
august
he
is
in
smolensk
and
his
only
thought
is
of
going
further
though
as
we
now
see
this
movement
forward
obviously
spells
destruction
for
him
the
facts
say
the
obvious
thing
that
napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
danger
of
moving
on
moscow
nor
did
alexander
and
the
russian
commanders
think
then
about
luring
napoleon
but
both
thought
the
opposite
the
drawing
of
napoleon
into
the
depths
of
the
country
occurred
not
according
to
someones
plan
no
one
even
believed
in
such
a
possibility
but
occurred
as
the
result
of
the
most
complex
interplay
of
intrigues
aims
and
desires
of
the
people
participating
in
the
war
who
did
not
perceive
what
was
to
happen
and
what
would
be
the
only
salvation
of
russia
it
all
occurs
by
chance
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
the
armies
are
cut
in
two
we
attempt
to
unite
them
with
the
obvious
goal
of
giving
battle
and
holding
up
the
enemys
advance
but
in
this
attempt
to
unite
avoiding
battles
with
the
stronger
enemy
and
involuntarily
retreating
at
a
sharp
angle
we
draw
the
enemy
as
far
as
smolensk
but
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
we
retreat
at
a
sharp
angle
because
the
french
are
moving
between
the
two
armiesthe
angle
becomes
sharper
still
and
we
pull
further
back
because
barclay
de
tolly
an
unpopular
german
is
hateful
to
bagration
who
is
to
be
under
his
leadership
and
bagration
commanding
the
second
army
tries
to
take
as
long
as
possible
to
unite
with
barclay
and
put
himself
under
his
command
bagration
does
not
unite
with
him
for
a
long
time
though
the
main
goal
of
the
entire
leadership
lies
in
this
union
because
it
seems
to
him
that
in
this
march
he
is
putting
his
army
in
danger
and
that
the
most
advantageous
thing
for
him
will
be
to
retreat
more
to
the
left
and
south
worrying
the
enemy
from
the
flank
and
the
rear
and
filling
out
his
army
in
the
ukraine
but
it
seems
he
has
thought
up
this
plan
because
he
does
not
want
to
submit
to
the
hateful
and
juniorranking
german
barclay
the
emperor
stays
with
the
army
in
order
to
inspire
it
but
his
presence
and
his
not
knowing
what
to
decide
on
and
the
enormous
number
of
advisers
and
plans
destroys
the
first
armys
energy
for
action
and
the
army
retreats
at
the
drissa
camp
the
army
is
supposed
to
stop
but
paulucci
who
aims
at
becoming
commander
in
chief
unexpectedly
affects
alexander
with
his
energy
and
pfuels
whole
plan
is
dropped
and
the
whole
business
is
entrusted
to
barclay
but
since
barclay
does
not
inspire
confidence
his
power
is
restricted
the
armies
are
divided
there
is
no
unity
of
leadership
barclay
is
unpopular
but
this
confusion
division
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
german
commander
in
chief
results
on
the
one
hand
in
indecision
and
the
avoidance
of
battle
from
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
refrain
if
the
armies
had
been
together
and
had
not
had
barclay
for
commander
in
chief
and
on
the
other
hand
in
a
greater
and
greater
indignation
against
the
germans
and
the
arousing
of
a
patriotic
spirit
the
sovereign
finally
leaves
the
army
and
the
sole
and
most
convenient
pretext
chosen
for
his
departure
is
the
notion
that
he
must
inspire
the
people
in
the
capitals
to
arouse
a
national
war
and
this
visit
of
the
sovereign
to
moscow
triples
the
forces
of
the
russian
army
the
sovereign
leaves
the
army
so
as
not
to
get
in
the
way
of
the
commander
in
chiefs
unity
of
power
and
hopes
that
more
resolute
measures
will
be
taken
but
the
situation
of
the
army
leadership
becomes
still
weaker
and
more
confused
bennigsen
the
grand
duke
and
a
swarm
of
adjutant
generals
remain
in
the
army
to
watch
over
the
actions
of
the
commander
in
chief
and
rouse
his
energy
and
barclay
feeling
himself
still
less
free
under
the
eyes
of
all
these
eyes
of
the
sovereign
becomes
still
more
wary
of
decisive
actions
and
avoids
battle
barclay
stands
for
wariness
the
grand
duke
hints
at
treason
and
demands
a
general
battle
lubomirski
branicki
wlocki
and
their
like
fan
this
noise
so
much
that
barclay
under
the
pretext
of
delivering
some
papers
to
the
sovereign
sends
the
polish
adjutants
to
petersburg
and
enters
into
open
struggle
with
bennigsen
and
the
grand
duke
finally
in
smolensk
much
as
bagration
did
not
wish
it
the
two
armies
unite
bagration
drives
up
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
occupied
by
barclay
barclay
puts
on
his
sash
comes
out
to
meet
him
and
reports
to
his
senior
in
rank
bagration
bagration
in
this
contest
of
magnanimity
despite
his
seniority
of
rank
subordinates
himself
to
barclay
but
while
subordinating
himself
agrees
with
him
still
less
bagration
at
the
sovereigns
order
reports
to
him
personally
he
writes
to
arakcheev
be
it
as
my
sovereign
wills
but
i
can
in
no
way
work
with
this
minister
barclay
for
gods
sake
send
me
somewhere
even
if
it
is
to
command
a
regiment
but
i
cannot
be
here
and
the
whole
headquarters
is
full
of
germans
so
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
russian
to
live
and
it
is
to
no
avail
i
thought
i
was
truly
serving
the
sovereign
and
the
fatherland
but
on
closer
inspection
it
turns
out
that
i
am
serving
barclay
i
confess
i
do
not
want
to
the
swarm
of
branickis
wintzingerodes
and
their
like
poisons
relations
between
the
commanders
still
more
and
the
result
is
still
less
unity
they
prepare
to
attack
the
french
before
smolensk
a
general
is
sent
to
reconnoiter
the
positions
the
general
who
hates
barclay
goes
to
his
friend
the
commander
of
a
corps
spends
the
whole
day
with
him
returns
to
barclay
and
condemns
point
by
point
the
future
battlefield
which
he
has
not
seen
while
the
arguments
and
intrigues
about
the
future
battlefield
go
on
while
we
search
for
the
french
mistaking
their
whereabouts
the
french
stumble
upon
neverovskys
division
and
come
right
up
to
the
walls
of
smolensk
it
is
necessary
to
accept
the
unexpected
battle
at
smolensk
in
order
to
save
our
lines
of
communication
battle
is
given
thousands
are
killed
on
both
sides
smolensk
is
abandoned
against
the
will
of
the
sovereign
and
all
the
people
but
smolensk
is
burned
by
its
own
inhabitants
deceived
by
their
governor
and
the
ruined
inhabitants
set
an
example
for
other
russians
going
to
moscow
thinking
only
of
their
losses
and
kindling
hatred
for
the
enemy
napoleon
goes
further
we
retreat
and
the
very
thing
is
achieved
that
was
to
defeat
napoleon
ii
on
the
day
after
his
sons
departure
prince
nikolai
andreevich
summoned
princess
marya
to
him
well
what
are
you
pleased
now
he
said
to
her
youve
made
me
quarrel
with
my
son
are
you
pleased
thats
all
you
needed
are
you
pleasedit
pains
me
pains
me
im
old
and
weak
and
you
wanted
it
well
rejoice
rejoice
and
after
that
princess
marya
did
not
see
her
father
for
a
week
he
was
sick
and
did
not
leave
his
study
to
her
surprise
princess
marya
noticed
that
during
the
time
of
his
illness
the
old
prince
did
not
admit
mlle
bourienne
to
his
rooms
either
tikhon
alone
took
care
of
him
after
a
week
the
old
prince
came
out
and
took
up
his
former
life
again
busying
himself
especially
actively
with
constructions
and
gardens
and
stopping
all
his
former
relations
with
mlle
bourienne
his
look
and
cold
tone
with
princess
marya
seemed
to
say
to
her
see
you
thought
up
things
against
me
you
lied
to
prince
andrei
about
my
relations
with
this
frenchwoman
and
made
me
quarrel
with
him
but
you
see
i
need
neither
you
nor
the
frenchwoman
one
half
of
the
day
princess
marya
spent
with
nikolushka
supervising
his
lessons
giving
him
lessons
in
russian
and
music
herself
and
talking
with
dessales
the
other
the
day
she
spent
in
her
rooms
with
books
her
old
nanny
and
gods
people
who
sometimes
came
to
her
by
the
back
door
about
the
war
princess
marya
thought
as
women
think
about
war
she
feared
for
her
brother
who
was
there
was
horrified
not
understanding
it
at
the
cruelty
of
people
which
made
them
kill
each
other
but
she
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
this
war
which
seemed
to
her
the
same
as
all
other
wars
she
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
this
war
even
though
dessales
her
constant
interlocutor
passionately
interested
in
the
course
of
the
war
tried
to
explain
his
reflections
to
her
and
even
though
gods
people
who
came
to
see
her
spoke
with
horror
each
in
his
own
way
of
popular
rumors
about
the
coming
of
the
antichrist
and
even
though
julie
now
princess
drubetskoy
who
had
again
entered
into
correspondence
with
her
wrote
her
patriotic
letters
from
moscow
i
write
to
you
in
russian
my
good
friend
because
i
have
hatred
for
all
frenchmen
as
well
as
their
language
which
i
cannot
hear
to
speakwe
in
moscow
are
all
ravished
through
enthusiasm
for
our
adored
emperor
my
poor
husband
suffers
travails
and
hunger
in
jewish
pothouses
but
the
news
which
i
have
inspires
me
still
more
you
must
have
heard
about
the
heroic
deed
of
raevsky
in
embracing
his
two
sons
and
saying
i
shall
perish
with
them
but
we
will
not
waver
and
indeed
though
the
enemy
was
twice
stronger
we
did
not
waver
we
pass
our
time
as
we
can
but
in
war
as
in
war
princess
alina
and
sophie
sit
whole
days
with
me
and
we
unfortunate
widows
of
living
husbands
make
beautiful
conversations
over
the
lint
only
you
my
friend
are
lacking
and
so
on
princess
marya
did
not
understand
the
whole
significance
of
the
war
mainly
because
the
old
prince
never
spoke
of
it
did
not
acknowledge
it
and
at
dinner
laughed
at
dessales
when
he
talked
of
this
war
the
princes
tone
was
so
calm
and
assured
that
princess
marya
unreasoningly
believed
him
for
the
whole
month
of
july
the
old
prince
was
extremely
active
and
even
animated
he
started
a
new
garden
and
a
new
building
constructed
for
the
servants
one
thing
that
troubled
princess
marya
was
that
he
slept
little
and
having
abandoned
his
habit
of
sleeping
in
the
study
changed
his
sleeping
place
every
day
one
day
he
would
order
his
camp
bed
made
up
in
the
gallery
then
he
would
remain
on
the
sofa
or
the
voltaire
armchair
in
the
drawing
room
and
doze
off
without
undressing
while
instead
of
mlle
bourienne
the
boy
petrusha
read
to
him
then
he
would
spend
the
night
in
the
dining
room
on
the
first
of
august
a
second
letter
came
from
prince
andrei
in
his
first
letter
which
had
come
soon
after
his
departure
prince
andrei
had
humbly
asked
his
fathers
forgiveness
for
what
he
had
allowed
himself
to
tell
him
and
asked
to
be
restored
to
his
favor
to
this
the
old
man
had
replied
with
an
affectionate
letter
and
after
that
letter
had
distanced
the
frenchwoman
from
himself
the
second
letter
from
prince
andrei
written
from
near
vitebsk
after
the
french
had
occupied
it
consisted
of
a
brief
description
of
the
whole
campaign
with
a
map
drawn
in
the
letter
and
of
reflections
on
the
further
course
of
the
campaign
in
this
letter
prince
andrei
pointed
out
to
his
father
the
inconvenience
of
his
position
near
the
theater
of
war
directly
in
the
line
of
movement
of
the
troops
and
advised
him
to
go
to
moscow
that
day
at
dinner
when
dessales
said
he
had
heard
that
the
french
had
already
entered
vitebsk
the
old
prince
remembered
about
prince
andreis
letter
i
received
a
letter
from
prince
andrei
today
he
said
to
princess
marya
have
you
read
it
no
mon
p232re
the
princess
replied
fearfully
she
could
not
have
read
a
letter
the
reception
of
which
she
had
not
even
heard
about
he
writes
about
this
war
the
prince
said
with
that
contemptuous
smile
that
had
become
habitual
to
him
whenever
he
spoke
about
the
ongoing
war
it
must
be
very
interesting
said
dessales
the
prince
is
in
a
position
to
know
ah
very
interesting
said
mlle
bourienne
go
and
fetch
it
for
me
the
old
prince
turned
to
mlle
bourienne
you
know
on
the
little
table
under
the
paperweight
mlle
bourienne
jumped
up
joyfully
ah
no
he
cried
frowning
you
go
mikhail
ivanych
mikhail
ivanych
got
up
and
went
to
the
study
but
as
soon
as
he
left
the
old
prince
looked
around
uneasily
threw
down
his
napkin
and
went
himself
they
cant
do
anything
they
get
it
all
muddled
while
he
was
gone
princess
marya
dessales
mlle
bourienne
and
even
nikolushka
silently
exchanged
glances
the
old
prince
came
back
with
hurried
steps
accompanied
by
mikhail
ivanych
with
the
letter
and
a
plan
which
he
put
down
next
to
him
not
letting
anyone
read
them
during
dinner
having
moved
to
the
drawing
room
he
gave
the
letter
to
princess
marya
and
spreading
out
in
front
of
him
the
plan
of
the
new
construction
at
which
he
directed
his
eyes
told
her
to
read
it
aloud
when
she
had
read
the
letter
princess
marya
gave
her
father
a
questioning
glance
he
was
looking
at
the
plan
obviously
immersed
in
his
thoughts
what
do
you
think
of
that
prince
dessales
allowed
himself
to
address
him
with
a
question
i
i
said
the
prince
as
if
unpleasantly
awakened
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
construction
plan
its
quite
possible
that
the
theater
of
war
will
get
so
close
to
us
ha
ha
ha
the
theater
of
war
said
the
prince
i
have
said
and
i
still
say
that
the
theater
of
war
is
poland
and
the
enemy
will
never
penetrate
beyond
the
niemen
dessales
looked
with
astonishment
at
the
prince
who
spoke
of
the
niemen
when
the
enemy
was
already
at
the
dnieper
but
princess
marya
who
had
forgotten
the
geographical
position
of
the
niemen
thought
that
what
her
father
had
said
was
true
the
snow
will
melt
and
theyll
drown
in
the
polish
swamps
only
they
could
fail
to
see
that
said
the
prince
evidently
thinking
of
the
campaign
of
1807
which
took
place
as
it
seemed
to
him
so
recently
bennigsen
should
have
entered
prussia
sooner
then
things
would
have
taken
a
different
turn
but
prince
dessales
said
timidly
the
letter
mentions
vitebsk
ah
yes
the
letter
the
prince
said
with
displeasure
yesyes
his
face
suddenly
took
on
a
dark
expression
he
paused
yes
he
writes
that
the
french
were
crushedby
what
river
was
it
dessales
lowered
his
eyes
the
prince
writes
nothing
about
that
he
said
softly
he
doesnt
well
i
didnt
think
it
up
myself
everyone
was
silent
for
a
long
time
yesyesso
mikhail
ivanych
he
said
suddenly
raising
his
head
and
pointing
to
the
construction
plan
tell
me
how
you
want
to
change
it
mikhail
ivanych
went
over
to
the
plan
and
the
prince
having
talked
with
him
about
the
plan
for
the
new
construction
glanced
angrily
at
princess
marya
and
dessales
and
went
to
his
room
princess
marya
saw
the
embarrassed
and
astonished
glance
dessales
directed
at
her
father
noticed
his
silence
and
was
struck
to
see
that
her
father
had
forgotten
his
sons
letter
on
the
table
in
the
drawing
room
but
she
was
afraid
not
only
to
speak
and
ask
dessales
about
the
cause
of
his
embarrassment
and
silence
but
afraid
even
to
think
about
it
in
the
evening
mikhail
ivanych
sent
by
the
prince
came
to
princess
marya
for
prince
andreis
letter
which
had
been
forgotten
in
the
drawing
room
princess
marya
handed
him
the
letter
though
it
was
unpleasant
for
her
she
allowed
herself
to
ask
mikhail
ivanych
what
her
father
was
doing
he
keeps
bustling
about
mikhail
ivanych
said
with
a
respectfully
mocking
smile
which
made
princess
marya
turn
pale
hes
very
anxious
about
the
new
building
he
read
for
a
while
and
now
said
mikhail
ivanych
lowering
his
voice
hes
at
his
desk
must
be
busy
with
his
will
lately
one
of
the
princes
favorite
occupations
had
been
busying
himself
with
the
papers
that
were
to
be
left
after
his
death
and
which
he
called
his
will
and
alpatych
is
being
sent
to
smolensk
asked
princess
marya
that
he
is
maam
hes
been
waiting
a
long
time
iii
when
mikhail
ivanych
came
back
to
the
study
with
the
letter
the
prince
wearing
spectacles
with
a
shade
over
his
eyes
and
over
the
candle
was
sitting
at
the
open
bureau
with
papers
in
his
outstretched
hand
reading
in
a
somewhat

as
he
called
them
to
be
delivered
to
the
sovereign
after
his
death
when
mikhail
ivanych
came
in
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
of
remembrance
of
the
time
when
he
had
been
writing
what
he
was
now
reading
he
took
the
letter
from
mikhail

hands
put
it
in
his
pocket
put
his
papers
away
and
called
the
already
longwaiting
alpatych
he
had
written
what
he
needed
from
smolensk
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
walking
across
the
room
past
alpatych
who
was
waiting
at
the
door
he
began
giving
orders

he
took
a
few
steps
around
the
room
and
glanced
at
his
memorandum
then
deliver
the
letter
about
the
deed
to
the
governor
in
person
then
door
bolts
were
needed
for
the
new
construction
of
exactly
the
design
the
prince
himself
had
devised
then
an
ironbound
box
had
to
be
ordered
to
keep
the
will
in
the
giving
of
instructions
to
alpatych
went
on
for
more
than
two
hours
the
prince
would
not
let
him
go
he
sat
down
fell
to
thinking
and
closing
his
eyes
dozed
off
alpatych
stirred
well
off
you
go
off
you
go
if
i
need
anything
ill
send
for
you
alpatych
left
the
prince
went
over
to
the
bureau
again
looked
into
it
touched
his
papers
with
his
hand
locked
it
again
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
to
write
the
letter
to
the
governor
it
was
already
late
when
he
stood
up
having
sealed
the
letter
he
wanted
to
sleep
but
he
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
fall
asleep
and
that
the
worst
thoughts
came
to
him
in
bed
he
called
tikhon
and
walked
about
the
rooms
with
him
so
as
to
tell
him
where
to
make
up
his
bed
for
that
night
he
walked
about
sizing
up
every
little
corner
everywhere
seemed
bad
to
him
but
worst
of
all
was
his
customary
couch
in
the
study
this
couch
was
frightful
to
him
probably
because
of
the
painful
thoughts
that
came
to
him
as
he
lay
on
it
nowhere
was
good
but
in
any
case
the
best
of
all
was
the
little
corner
in
the
sitting
room
behind
the
piano
he
had
never
yet
slept
there
tikhon
and
another
servant
brought
the
bed
and
began
to
make
it
up
not
like
that
not
like
that
cried
the
prince
and
he
himself
moved
it
a
few
inches
further
from
the
corner
then
a
little
closer
again
well
ive
finally
done
everything
now
i
can
rest
thought
the
prince
and
he
allowed
tikhon
to
undress
him
wincing
vexedly
at
the
efforts
that
had
to
be
made
in
order
to
take
off
his
kaftan
and
trousers
the
prince
undressed
lowered
himself
heavily
onto
the
bed
and
seemed
to
lapse
into
thought
looking
contemptuously
at
his
yellow
shriveled
legs
he
did
not
lapse
into
thought
but
hesitated
before
the
labor
that
faced
him
of
raising
those
legs
and
shifting
himself
onto
the
bed
oh
how
hard
it
is
oh
if
only
these
labors
would
be
over
quickly
quickly
and
you
would
release
me
he
thought
compressing
his
lips
he
made
this
effort
for
the
twentieth
time
and
lay
down
but
just
as
he
lay
down
the
whole
bed
suddenly
began
moving
rhythmically
back
and
forth
under
him
as
if
breathing
heavily
and
jostling
this
happened
to
him
almost
every
night
he
opened
his
justclosing
eyes
no
peace
curse
you
he
growled
angrily
at
someone
yes

taken
from
his
pocket
and
a
little
table
with
lemonade
and
a
spiral
wax
candle
moved
closer
to
the
bed
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
began
to
read
only
now
in
the
quiet
of
night
by
the
faint
light
from
under
the
green
shade
reading
through
the
letter
did
he
momentarily
grasp
its
meaning
for
the
first
time

stood

he
a

without

on

goes
into

decorated
tent
and
a
burning
feeling
of
envy
of
the
favorite
as
strong
now
as
it
was
then
stirs
him
and
he
remembers
all
the
words
that
were
said
then
at
his
first
meeting
with
potemkin
and
before
him
stands
a
short

her
smiles
her
words
when
she
received
him
with

for

and
he
remembers
the
same
face
on
a
catafalque
and
his
clash
with
zubov
who
then
stood
by
her
coffin
over
his
right
to
go
up
and
kiss
her
hand
ah
quickly

demanded

marya
told
her
that
as
the
prince
was
not
quite
well
and
was
taking
no
measures
for
his
own
safety
and
it
was
clear
from
prince
andreis
letter
that
to
stay
at
bald
hills
was
unsafe
he
respectfully
advised
her
to
write
and
send
with
alpatych
her
own
letter
to
the
head
of
the
province
in
smolensk
asking
him

the

were

with

did
not

fields
around

some
with
already
yellow
rye
some
with
bushy
stillgreen
oats
some
still
black
where
the
crossplowing
was
just
beginning
alpatych
drove
along
admiring
the
rare
yield
of
this
years
spring
crops
looking
attentively
at
the
strips
of
rye
in
which
the
reaping
was
beginning
here
and
there
and
having
a
stewards
thoughts
about
sowing
and
harvesting
and
about
not
forgetting
any
of
the
princes
orders
having
fed
his
horses
twice
on
the
way
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
august
alpatych
arrived
in
town
on
his
way
alpatych
met
and
passed
baggage
trains
and
troops
driving
up
to
smolensk
he
heard
distant
shooting
but
these
sounds
did
not
strike
him
what
struck
him
most
strongly
was
when
nearing
smolensk
he
saw
a
beautiful
field
of
oats
which
some
soldiers
were
mowing
evidently
for
fodder
and
on
which
they
had
pitched
their
camp
this
circumstance
struck
alpatych
but
he
soon
forgot
it
thinking
about
his
own
business
all
the
interests
of
alpatychs
life
for
the
past
thirty
years
had
been
confined
to
the
princes
will
alone
and
he
never
went
outside
that
circle
anything
that
did
not
concern
the
fulfilling
of
the
princes
orders
not
only
did
not
interest
alpatych
but
did
not
exist
for
him
alpatych
arriving
in
smolensk
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
august
stopped
across
the
dnieper
in
the
suburb
of
gachena
at
the
inn
kept
by
the
innkeeper
ferapontov
where
he
had
been
accustomed
to
stay
for
the
past
thirty
years
twelve
years
before
ferapontov
with
a
bit
of
a
hand
from
alpatych
had
bought
a
woods
from
the
prince
went
into
commerce
and
now
owned
a
house
an
inn
and
a
flour
shop
in
the
provincial
capital
ferapontov
was
a
fat
blackhaired
redfaced
fortyyearold

with
thick

and
a

ferapontov
in

and
a
chintz

he
went
up
to
him
welcome
yakov
alpatych

said
the

a
sure
thing
and
the
peasants

roubles
for
a
cartthats
heathenish
yakov
alpatych
listened
inattentively
he
asked
for
a
samovar
and
some
hay
for
the
horses
and
having
had
his
tea
went
to
bed
all
night
troops
moved
down
the
street
past
the
inn
the
next
day
alpatych
put
on
the
tunic
that
he
wore
only
in
town
and
went
about
his
business
the
morning
was
sunny
and
by
eight
oclock
it
was
already
hot
a
precious
day
for
harvesting
alpatych
thought
outside

been
heard
since

eight
oclock
cannon
fire
had
joined
the
musket
shots
there
were
many
people
in
the
streets
hurrying
somewhere
and
many
soldiers
but
the
cabbies
drove
around
as

shopkeepers
stood
by
their
shops
and
services
went
on
in
the
churches
alpatych
went
to
the
shops
to
the
government
offices
to
the
post
office
and
to
the
governor
in
the
government
offices
in
the

at
the
post

everyone
was
talking
about
the
troops
about
the
enemy
who
was
already
attacking
the
town
they
were
all
asking
each
other
what
to
do
and
they
were
all
trying
to
reassure
each
other
at
the
governors
house
alpatych
found
a
large
number
of
people
cossacks
and
a
traveling
carriage
belonging
to
the
governor
on
the
porch
yakov
alpatych
met
two
gentlemen
one
of
whom
he
knew
the
gentleman

knew
a
former
district
police

said

saw
alpatych

his
excellency
to

the
governor
replied
alpatych
proudly
holding
up
his
head
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
bosom
as
he
always
did
when
he
mentioned
the
princehe
was
pleased
to

heard

he
said
again
and
stepped
off
the
porch
alpatych
shook
his
head
and
went
up
the
steps
in
the
waiting
room
there
were
merchants
women
officials
silently
exchanging
glances
with
each
other
the
door
to
the
office
opened
they
all
stood
up
and
moved
forward
an
official
ran
out
said
something
to
a
merchant
told
a
fat
official
with
a
cross
on
his
neck
to
follow
him
and
again
disappeared
behind
the
door
obviously
avoiding
all
the
glances
and
questions
addressed
to
him
alpatych
moved
to
the
front
and
at
the
officials
next
emergence
placing
his
hand
inside
his
buttoned
tunic
addressed
the
official
handing
him
two
letters
to
baron
asch
from
general
in
chief
prince
bolkonsky
he
intoned
so
solemnly
and
significantly
that
the
official
turned
to
him
and
took
his
letters
a
few
minutes
later
the
governor
received
alpatych
and
hurriedly
said
to
him
inform
the
prince
and
princess
that
nothing
was
known
to
me
i
have
been
acting
on
orders
from
abovehere

the

did
not
finish
a
dusty
and
sweaty
officer
came
running
in
and
began
saying
something
in
french
a
look
of
terror
appeared
on
the
governors
face
go
he
said
nodding
to
alpatych
and
he
started
asking
the
officer
something
greedy
frightened
helpless
eyes
turned
to
alpatych
when
he
came
out
of
the
governors
office
involuntarily
listening
now
to
the
near
and
everincreasing
gunfire
alpatych
hurried
to
the
inn
the
paper
that
the
governor
gave
to
alpatych
was
the
following
i
assure
you
that
the
town
of
smolensk
is
not

threatened
with
the
least
danger

it
is
unlikely

until
the
last

from
the
innkeepers
room
came
the
sound
of
a
child
crying
a
womans
rending
sobs
and
the
angry
hoarse
shouting
of
ferapontov
the
cook
like
a
frightened
hen
fluttered
up
in
the
front
hall
as
soon
as
alpatych

how
he
dragged
her
alpatych
seemed
to
nod
his
head
approvingly
at
these
words
and
not
wishing
to
know
any
more
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
opposite
the
innkeepers
where
he
had
left
his
purchases
you
villain
murderer
a
thin
pale
woman
cried
out
at
that
moment
and
a
baby
in
her
arms
the
kerchief
torn
from
her
head
she
burst
through
the
door
and
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
yard
ferapontov
came
out
after
her
and
seeing
alpatych
straightened
his
waistcoat
smoothed
his
hair
yawned
and
followed
alpatych
into
the
room
so

mean
to
leave
already
he
asked
without
answering
the
question
or
turning
to
look
at
the
innkeeper
alpatych
sorting
his
purchases
asked
how
much
he
owed
for
his
stay
ill
reckon

governors

ferapontov

he
added
while
the
horses
were
being
hitched
up
alpatych
and
ferapontov
drank
their
tea
and
talked
about
the
price
of
wheat
about
the
crops
and
the
good
weather
for
harvesting
its
quieting
down
though
said
ferapontov
having
drunk
three
cups
of
tea
and

in

day
alpatych
gathered
up
his
purchases
gave
them
to
the
entering
coachman
and
paid
the
innkeeper
from
the
gates
came
the
sound
of
wheels
hoofs
and
bells
from
the
little
kibitka
rolling
out
it
was
already
long
past
noon
half
the
street
was
in
shadow
the
other
half
brightly
lit
by
the
sun
alpatych
glanced
out
the
window
and
went
to
the
door
suddenly
there
came
the
strange
sound
of
a
distant
whistling
and
a
thud
and
after
that
the
merging
roar
of
cannon
fire
which
made
the
windows
shake
alpatych
went
outside
two
men
were
running
down
the
street
towards
the
bridge
from
different
sides
came
the
whistle
and
thud
of
cannonballs
and
the
explosions
of
shells
falling
on
the
town
but
the
inhabitants
scarcely
heard
or
paid
attention
to
these
noises
in
comparison
with
the
sound
of
gunfire
outside
town
this
was
the
bombardment
of
the
town
which
napoleon
had
ordered
opened
from
a
hundred
and
thirty
cannon
starting
at
four
oclock
at
first
people
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
this
bombardment
the
sounds
of
the
falling
shells
and
cannonballs
aroused
only
curiosity
at
first
ferapontovs
wife
who
till
then
had
not
stopped
wailing
in
the
shed
fell
silent
and
came
out
to
the
gates
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
looking
silently
at
people
and
listening
to
the
sounds
the
cook
and
the
shop
clerk
came
out
to
the
gates
everyone
tried
with
merry
curiosity
to
catch
sight
of
the
projectiles
racing
over
their
heads
several
men
came
around
the
corner
talking
animatedly
some
force
said
one
it
just
smashed
the
roof
and
ceiling
to
splinters
rooted
up
the
earth
like
a
pig
said
another
thats
a
grand
thing
that
cheers
you
up
he
said
laughing
lucky
you
jumped
out
of
the
way
or
it
would
have
flattened
you
people
began
to
address
these
men
they
stopped
and
told
how
a
cannonball
had
struck
a
house
right
next
to
them
meanwhile
more
projectiles
now
cannonballs
with
their
quick
grim
whistle
now
shells
with
their
pleasant
whine
went
on
flying
over
peoples
heads
but
not
a
single
one
fell
nearby
they
all
carried
too
far
alpatych
was
getting
into
the
little
kibitka
the
innkeeper
was
standing
at
the
gate
as
if
theres
anything
to
see
he
shouted
to
the
cook
who
her
sleeves
rolled
up
in
her
red
skirt
swinging
her
bare
elbows
went
to
the
corner
to
hear
what
was
being
said
what
a
wonder
she
kept
saying
but
hearing
the
innkeepers
voice
she
came
back
straightening
her
tuckedup
skirt
again
very
close
this
time
something
whistled
like
a
bird
flying
down
from
above
fire
flashed
in
the
middle
of
the
street
something
went
off
and
the
street
was
covered
with
smoke
villain
what
did
you
do
that
for
cried
the
innkeeper
running
to
the
cook
at
the
same
moment
women
wailed
pitifully
on
all
sides
a
frightened
child
wept
and
people
with
pale
faces
silently
crowded
around
the
cook
in
this
crowd
the
cooks
moaning
and
pleading
were
heard
most
of
all
ahh
my
dear
hearts
my
dear
kind
hearts
dont
let
me
die
my
dear
kind
hearts
five
minutes
later
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
street
the
cook
her
hip
smashed
by
a
shell
splinter
had
been
carried
to
the
kitchen
alpatych
his
coachman
ferapontovs
wife
and
children
the
yard
porter
were
sitting
in
the
cellar
listening
the
noise
of
the
guns
the
whistle
of
projectiles
and
the
pitiful
moaning
of
the
cook
rising
above
all
the
other
sounds
did
not
stop
for
a
moment
the
innkeepers
wife
now
rocked
and
comforted
the
baby
now
asked
each
person
who
came
to
the
cellar
what
had
become
of
her
husband
who
had
stayed
outside
the
shop
clerk
who
came
to
the
cellar
told
her
that
the
innkeeper
had
gone
with
other
people
to
the
cathedral
where
the
miracleworking
icon
of
smolensk
had
been
taken
up
towards
dusk
the
cannonade
began
to
subside
alpatych
came
out
of
the
cellar
and
stopped
in
the
doorway
the
previously
clear
evening
sky
was
all
covered
with
smoke
and
through
this
smoke
the
light
of
the
young
crescent
moon
high
in
the
sky
shone
strangely
after
the
terrible
roar
of
the
guns
ceased
silence
seemed
to
hang
over
the
town
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
footsteps
groans
distant
shouts
and
the
crackle
of
fires
spread
all
over
town
the
cooks
moans
now
subsided
on
two
sides
the
black
smoke
of
fires
rose
and
spread
soldiers
walked
and
ran
down
the
streets
not
in
ranks
but
like
ants
from
a
demolished
anthill
in
various
uniforms
and
in
various
directions
several
of
them
ran
into
ferapontovs
yard
before
alpatychs
eyes
alpatych
went
to
the
gate
some
regiment
crowding
and
hurrying
blocked
the
street
on
its
way
out
of
town
the
town
has
surrenderedleave
leave
an
officer
said
noticing
his
figure
and
at
once
turned
to
the
soldiers
shouting
ill
teach
you
to
go
running
into
yards
apatych
went
back
to
the
cottage
and
calling
the
coachman
told
him
to
set
off
after
alpatych
and
the
coachman
ferapontovs
entire
household
came
out
seeing
the
smoke
and
even
the
flames
of
the
fires
that
had
now
become
visible
in
the
falling
twilight
the
women
so
far
silent
suddenly
began
to
howl
looking
at
the
fires
as
if
seconding
them
the
same
lamenting
came
from
the
ends
of
the
street
in
the
shed
alpatych
and
the
coachman
with
trembling
hands
straightened
the
tangled
reins
and
harness
of
the
horses
as
alpatych
was
driving
through
the
gate
he
saw
some
ten
soldiers
in
ferapontovs
open
shop
talking
loudly
and
filling
sacks
and
bags
with
wheat
flour
and
sunflower
seeds
just
then
ferapontov
came
into
the
shop
from
the
street
seeing
the
soldiers
he
was
about
to
shout
something
but
suddenly
stopped
and
clutching
his
hair
burst
into
sobbing
laughter
take
it
all
lads
dont
leave
it
for
those
devils
he
shouted
seizing
the
sacks
himself
and
throwing
them
outside
some
of
the
soldiers
got
frightened
and
ran
away
some
went
on
pouring
seeing
alpatych
ferapontov
turned
to
him
done
for
russia
he
cried
alpatych
shes
done
for
ill
set
the
fire
myself
shes
done
for
ferapontov
ran
out
to
the
yard
a
constant
stream
of
soldiers
went
down
the
street
blocking
it
entirely
so
that
alpatych
could
not
drive
out
and
had
to
wait
ferapontovs
wife
and
children
were
also
sitting
on
a
cart
waiting
until
they
could
leave
it
was
already
night
there
were
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
young
moon
shone
covered
from
time
to
time
by
the
smoke
on
the
descent
to
the
dnieper
the
wagons
of
alpatych
and
the
innkeepers
wife
moving
slowly
amidst
the
lines
of
soldiers
and
other
vehicles
had
to
stop
not
far
from
the
intersection
at
which
the
wagons
stopped
in
a
lane
a
house
and
some
shops
were
burning
the
fire
was
already
going
out
the
flames
died
down
and
were
lost
in
black
smoke
then
suddenly
flared
up
brightly
lighting
up
with
a
strange
distinctness
the
faces
of
the
crowding
people
standing
at
the
intersection
before
the
fire
the
black
figures
of
people
flitted
talking
and
shouting
could
be
heard
through
the
ceaseless
crackling
of
the
flames
alpatych
getting
out
of
the
wagon
saw
that
the
way
would
not
soon
be
free
and
turned
into
the
lane
to
look
at
the
fire
soldiers
constantly
darted
up
and
down
past
the
fire
and
alpatych
saw
two
soldiers
and
with
them
some
man
in
a
frieze
overcoat
drag
burning
beams
out
of
the
fire
and
across
the
street
to
a
neighboring
yard
while
others
carried
armfuls
of
straw
alpatych
went
up
to
a
large
crowd
of
people
standing
in
front
of
a
tall
barn
that
was
burning
at
full
blaze
the
walls
were
all
on
fire
the
back
wall
fell

plank

caving
in

in

the
crowd
was
apparently
waiting
for
the
roof
to

waited
for
that
alpatych
someones
familiar

berg
apologized
for
something
something
cracked
in
the
fire
the
fire
subsided
for
a
moment
black
clouds
of
smoke
poured
from
under
the
roof
something
cracked
still
more
fearfully
in
the
flames
and
something
enormous
collapsed
hoohoohoo
roared
the
crowd
seconding
the
collapsed
ceiling
of
the
barn
from
which
came
a
smell
of
pancakes
produced
by
the
burning
grain
the
flames
flared
up
and
illuminated
the
animatedly
joyful
and
wornout
faces
of
the
people
who
stood
around
the
fire
the
man
in
the
frieze
overcoat
raising

voices

then
said
prince
andrei
turning
to
alpatych
convey
everything
as
ive
told
you
and
without
saying
a
word
to
berg
who
stood
silent
beside
him
he
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
lane
v
from
smolensk
the
troops
continued
to
retreat
the
enemy
followed
after
them
on
the
tenth
of
august
the
regiment
under
prince
andreis
command
was
going
down
the
high
road
past
the
avenue
that
led
to
bald
hills
the
heat
and
drought
had
lasted
for
more
than
three
weeks
every
day
fleecy
clouds
crossed
the
sky
occasionally
covering
the
sun
but
towards
evening
it
cleared
up
again
and
the
sun
set
in
a
reddish
brown
murk
only
the
heavy
dews
at
night
refreshed
the
earth
the
standing
wheat
was
scorched
and
spilled
its
grains
the
swamps
dried
up
the
cattle
lowed
from
hunger
finding
no
food
in
the
sunparched
meadows
it
was
cool
only
at
night
and
in
the
woods
while
the
dew
lasted
but
on
the
road
on
the
high
road
along
which
the
troops
were
marching
there
was
not
that
coolness
even
at
night
and
in
the
woods
there
was
no
dew
to
be
seen
on
the
sandy
dust
of
the
road
churned
up
more
than
half
a
foot
deep
as
soon
as
dawn
broke
movement
began
baggage
trains
and
artillery
went
noiselessly
sunk
to
the
hubs
and
infantry
sunk
to
the
ankles
in
the
soft
suffocating
hot
dust
that
did
not
cool
down
overnight
this
dust
was
kneaded
by
feet
and
wheels
the
rest
rose
and
hung
in
a
cloud
over
the
troops
filling
the
eyes
hair
ears
nostrils
and
above
all
the
lungs
of
the
men
and
animals
moving
along
this
road
the
higher
the
sun
rose
the
higher
rose
the
cloud
of
dust
and
through
this
fine
hot
dust
one
could
look
with
the
naked
eye
at
the
sun
not
covered
by
clouds
the
sun
looked
like
a
large
crimson
ball
there
was
no
wind
and
the
men
suffocated
in
this
unstirring
atmosphere
they
walked
on
tying
handkerchiefs
over
their
noses
and
mouths
when
they
came
to
a
village
they
all
rushed
to
the
wells
they
fought
over
the
water
and
drank
it
down
to
the
mud
prince
andrei
was
in
command
of
a
regiment
and
the
organization
of
the
regiment
the
wellbeing
of
his
men
the
necessity
of
receiving
and
giving
orders
diverted
him
the
burning
and
abandoning
of
smolensk
marked
an
epoch
for
prince
andrei
the
new
feeling
of
anger
against
the
foe
made
him
forget
his
own
grief
he
was
devoted
entirely
to
the
affairs
of
his
regiment
he
was
solicitous
of
his
men
and
officers
and
affectionate
with
them
in
his
regiment
he
was
known
as
our
prince
they
were
proud
of
him
and
loved
him
but
he
was
kind
and
mild
only
with
the
men
of
his
regiment
with
timokhin
and
the
rest
totally
new
people
and
in
strange
surroundings
who
could
not
know
and
understand
his
past
but
as
soon
as
he
ran
into
someone
from
his
former
life
some
staff
officer
he
at
once
bristled
up
again
he
became
spiteful
mocking
and
contemptuous
he
was
repulsed
by
everything
that
bound
him
to
the
memory
of
the
past
and
therefore
he
tried
in
relation
to
his
former
world
only
not
to
be
unfair
and
to
fulfill
his
duty
true
everything
presented
itself
in
a
dark
gloomy
light
to
prince
andreiespecially
after
the
abandoning
of
smolensk
which
to
his
mind
could
and
should
have
been
defended
on
the
sixth
of
august
and
after
his
ailing
father
had
to
flee
to
moscow
and
leave
to
be
pillaged
his
beloved
bald
hills
which
he
had
built
and
peopled
but
despite
that
thanks
to
his
regiment
prince
andrei
could
think
about
a
subject
completely
independent
of
general
problemsabout
his
regiment
on
the
tenth
of
august
the
column
of
which
his
regiment
formed
level
with
bald
hills
two
days
earlier
prince
andrei
had
received
news
that
his
father
son
and
sister
had
left
for
moscow
though
prince
andrei
had
nothing
to
do
there
he
with
his
own
peculiar
wish
to
exacerbate
his
grief
decided
that
he
had
to
stop
and
see
bald
hills
he
ordered
a
horse
saddled
for
him
and
while
on
the
march
rode
to
his
fathers
estate
where
he
was
born
and
spent
his
childhood
going
past
the
pond
where
there
were
always
dozens
of
village
women
talking
together
wielding
battledores
and
rinsing
their
laundry
prince
andrei
noticed
that
there
was
no
one
at
the
pond
and
a
little
raft
torn
free
half
sunk
in
the
water
was
floating
in
the
middle
of
it
prince
andrei
rode
up
to
the
watch
box
there
was
no
one
by
the
stone
gates
of
the
entrance
and
the
door
was
open
the
footpaths
of
the
garden
were
already
overgrown
and
calves
and
horses
wandered
over
the
english
park
prince
andrei
rode
up
to
the
conservatory
there
was
broken
glass
some
of
the
trees
in
tubs
were
overturned
and
some
were
dry
he
called
out
for
taras
the
gardener
no
one
replied
having
ridden
around
the
conservatory
to
the
outdoor
beds
he
saw
that
the
carved
wooden
fence
was
all
broken
and
plums
had
been
pulled
off
with
their
branches
an
old
peasant
prince
andrei
used
to
see
him
by
the
gates
in
his
childhood
was
sitting
on
a
little
green
bench
plaiting
a
bast
shoe
he
was
deaf
and
did
not
hear
prince
andrei
ride
up
he
was
sitting
on
the
bench
on
which
the
old
prince
had
liked
to
sit
and
beside
him
strips
of
bast
were
hanging
on
the
branches
of
a
broken
and
withered
magnolia
prince
andrei
rode
up
to
the
house
several
lindens
in
the
old
garden
had
been
cut
down
a
piebald
mare
with
a
foal
was
walking
right
in
front
of
the
house
between
the
rosebushes
the
shutters
were
closed
one
window
on
the
ground
floor
was
open
a
serf
boy
seeing
prince
andrei
ran
into
the
house
alpatych
having
sent
the
family
away
had
remained
alone
at
bald
hills
he
was
at
home
reading
the
lives
of
the
saints
learning
of
prince
andreis
arrival
he
came
out
of
the
house
with
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
buttoning
himself
up
hastily
went
to
the
prince
and
without
saying
anything
wept
kissing
prince
andrei
on
the
knee
then
he
turned
away
vexed
at
his
own
weakness
and
began
to
report
on
the
state
of
things
everything
valuable
and
costly
had
been
transported
to
bogucharovo
the
grain
up
to
eight
hundred
bushels
had
also
been
taken
there
the
hay
and
this
years
spring
crops
remarkable
according
to
alpatych
had
been
mowed
while
still
green
and
takenby
the
troops
the
peasants
were
devastated
some
had
also
left
for
bogucharovo
a
small
number
had
remained
prince
andrei
not
hearing
him
out
asked
when
his
father
and
sister
had
left
meaning
when
they
had
left
for
moscow
alpatych
assuming
he
had
been
asked
about
their
departure
for
bogucharovo
replied
that
they
had
left
on
the
seventh
and
again
expanded
on
details
of
the
estate
management
asking
for
orders
shall
i
let
the
troops
have
oats
on
receipt
we
still
have
nearly
five
thousand
bushels
left
asked
alpatych
what
answer
can
i
give
him
thought
prince
andrei
looking
at
the
old
mans
bald
head
shining
in
the
sun
and
reading
in
the
expression
of
his
face
that
he
understood
how
inappropriate
his
questions
were
but
that
he
had
asked
them
just
to
stifle
his
own
grief
yes
let
them
he
said
if
youve
been
pleased
to
notice
disorders
in
the
garden
said
alpatych
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
them
three
regiments
passed
through
and
spent
the
night
dragoons
in
particular
i
wrote
down
the
rank
and
name
of
the
commander
so
as
to
present
a
petition
well
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
will
you
stay
if
the
enemy
takes
it
prince
andrei
asked
him
alpatych
turning
his
face
towards
prince
andrei
looked
at
him
and
suddenly
in
a
solemn
gesture
he
raised
his
arm
aloft
he
is
my
protector
let
his
will
be
done
he
said
a
crowd
of
peasants
and
servants
walked
through
the
meadow
with
uncovered
heads
approaching
prince
andrei
well
goodbye
said
prince
andrei
leaning
down
to
alpatych
go
away
yourself
take
whatever
you
can
with
you
and
tell
the
people
to
leave
for
ryazan
or
the
estate
outside
moscow
alpatych
pressed
himself
to
his
leg
and
burst
into
sobs
prince
andrei
carefully
removed
him
and
spurring
his
horse
galloped
down
the
avenue
by
the
outside
beds
the
old
man
still
sat
as
indifferently
as
a
fly
on
the
face
of
a
dead
loved
one
tapping
the
bast
shoe
on
its
last
and
two
girls
their
skirts
filled
with
plums
picked
from
the
conservatory
trees
ran
out
from
there
and
met
prince
andrei
seeing
the
young
master
the
older
girl
with
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
seized
her
younger
friend
by
the
hand
and
hid
with
her
behind
a
birch
tree
having
no
time
to
pick
up
the
spilled
green
plums
prince
andrei
turned
away
from
them
in
frightened
haste
afraid
of
letting
them
notice
that
he
had
seen
them
he
felt
sorry
for
this
pretty
frightened
girl
he
was
afraid
to
look
at
her
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
an
irresistible
desire
to
do
so
a
new
comforting
and
reassuring
feeling
came
over
him
when
looking
at
these
girls
he
realized
the
existence
of
other
human
interests
totally
foreign
to
him
and
as
legitimate
as
those
that
concerned
him
these
girls
obviously
had
a
passionate
wish
for
one
thingto
take
and
finish
eating
those
green
plums
without
being
caughtand
together
with
them
prince
andrei
wished
success
to
their
undertaking
he
could
not
help
glancing
at
them
one
more
time
supposing
themselves
out
of
danger
they
left
their
cover
and
piping
something
in
their
high
little
voices
holding
up
their
skirts
ran
merrily
and
quickly
with
their
bare
suntanned
little
feet
over
the
grass
of
the
meadow
prince
andrei
had
been
somewhat
refreshed
leaving
the
dusty
area
of
the
high
road
along
which
the
troops
were
moving
but
not
far
from
bald
hills
he
came
back
to
the
road
and
caught
up
with
his
regiment
at
a
stopping
place
by
a
dam
on
a
small
pond
it
was
past
one
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
a
red
ball
in
the
dust
scorched
and
burned
his
back
unbearably
through
his
black
tunic
dust
the
same
as
ever
hung
motionless
over
the
halted
troops
buzzing
with
talk
there
was
no
wind
as
he
rode
across
the
dam
prince
andrei
smelled
the
slime
and
freshness
of
the
pond
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
waterhowever
dirty
it
was
he
glanced
around
at
the
pond
from
which
came
shouts
and
loud
laughter
the
small
muddy
green
pond
had
evidently
risen
some
eight
inches
overflowing
the
dam
because
it
was
filled
with
the
naked
human
bodies
of
soldiers
flopping
about
in
it
white
with
brickred
hands
faces
and
necks
all
that
naked
white
human
flesh
with
whoops
and
guffaws
was
flopping
about
in
the
dirty
puddle
like
carp
in
a
bucket
this
flopping
about
suggested
merriment
and
that
made
it
particularly
sad
one
fairhaired
young
soldierprince
andrei
knew
himfrom
the
third
company
with
a
leather
band
on
his
ankle
was
crossing
himself
as
he
backed
up
to
make
his
run
and
dive
into
the
water
another
a
blackhaired
always
disheveled
noncommissioned
officer
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
his
muscular
torso
twitching
grunted
joyfully
raising
his
black
hairy
arms
and
pouring
water
over
his
head
there
were
sounds
of
slapping
shrieking
and
hooting
on
the
banks
on
the
dam
in
the
pond
everywhere
there
was
white
healthy
muscular
flesh
the
officer
timokhin
with
a
little
red
nose
was
wiping
himself
on
the
dam
and
seeing
the
prince
became
embarrassed
yet
ventured
to
address
him
its
nice
your
excellency
if
youd
be
so
pleased
he
said
its
dirty
said
prince
andrei
wincing
well
clear
it
for
you
right
away
and
timokhin
still
undressed
ran
to
clear
it
the
prince
wants
to
which
our
prince
voices
said
and
everybody
started
hurrying
so
that
prince
andrei
barely
managed
to
calm
them
down
he
decided
it
would
be
better
to
have
a
shower
in
the
shed
flesh
the
body
chair
224
canon
he
thought
looking
at
his
naked
body
and
he
shuddered
not
so
much
from
the
cold
as
from
revulsion
and
horror
incomprehensible
to
himself
at
the
sight
of
this
enormous
number
of
bodies
splashing
about
in
the
dirty
pond
on
the
seventh
of
august
prince
bagration
from
his
quarters
in
mikhailovka
on
the
smolensk
road
wrote
the
following
letter
to
arakcheev
but
he
knew
that
his
letter
would
be
read
by
the
sovereign
and
therefore
considered
every
word
as
far
as
he
was
capable
of
doing
so
dear
count
alexei
andreevich
i
believe
the
minister
has
already
reported
that
smolensk
has
been
left
to
the
enemy
it
is
painful
sad
and
the
whole
army
is
in
despair
that
the
most
important
place
has
been
abandoned
to
no
purpose
i
for
my
part
begged
him
most
insistently
in
person
and
finally
in
writing
but
nothing
moved
him
to
agree
i
swear
to
you
on
my
honor
that
napoleon
was
in
such
a
sack
as
never
before
and
he
could
have
lost
half
his
army
but
not
taken
smolensk
our
troops
fought
and
are
fighting
as
never
before
i
held
out
with
fifteen
thousand
men
for
more
than
thirtyfive
hours
and
beat
them
but
he
did
not
want
to
stay
even
fourteen
hours
it
is
shameful
and
a
blot
on
our
army
and
he
himself
it
seems
to
me
should
not
even
be
alive
in
the
world
if
he
reports
that
the
losses
were
greatit
is
not
true
maybe
around
four
thousand
not
more
and
not
even
that
even
if
it
was
ten
what
can
be
done
it
is
war
but
the
enemy
lost
endless
numbers
what
would
it
have
cost
to
stay
two
more
days
at
least
they
would
have
withdrawn
on
their
own
for
they
had
no
water
for
their
men
and
horses
he
gave
me
his
word
that
he
would
not
retreat
but
suddenly
sent
a
disposition
that
he
would
leave
during
the
night
it
is
impossible
to
make
war
that
way
and
we
may
soon
bring
the
enemy
to
moscow
the
rumor
is
going
around
that
you
are
thinking
about
peace
god
forbid
that
we
make
peace
after
all
the
sacrifices
and
after
such
muddleheaded
retreatsto
make
peace
you
will
set
the
whole
of
russia
against
you
and
every
one
of
us
will
think
it
a
shame
to
wear
a
uniform
if
things
have
gone
this
way
we
must
fight
as
long
as
russia
can
and
as
long
as
there
are
men
left
standing
one
person
must
be
in
command
not
two
your
minister
may
be
good
as
ministers
go
but
as
a
general
he
is
not
merely
bad
but
trash
and
to
him
the
fate
of
our
whole
fatherland
was
entrustedi
am
truly
going
out
of
my
mind
with
vexation
forgive
me
that
i
write
so
boldly
clearly
one
who
advises
the
concluding
of
peace
and
puts
a
minister
in
command
of
an
army
does
not
love
the
sovereign
and
wishes
the
destruction
of
us
all
and
so
i
am
writing
you
the
truth
call
out
the
militia
for
the
minister
in
a
most
masterly
way
is
bringing
a
guest
with
him
to
the
capital
the
great
suspicion
of
the
whole
army
falls
on
mister
imperial
adjutant
wolzogen
they
say
he
is
more
napoleons
than
ours
and
he
is
the
ministers
adviser
in
everything
i
am
not
merely
polite
with
him
but
i
obey
him
like
a
corporal
though
i
am
his
senior
this
is
painful
but
loving
my
benefactor
and
sovereign
i
obey
only
it
is
too
bad
that
the
sovereign
entrusts
our
fine
army
to
the
likes
of
him
imagine
that
on
our
retirade
we
lost
over
fifteen
thousand
men
from
fatigue
and
in
hospitals
if
we
had
been
on
the
offensive
that
would
not
have
happened
tell
me
for
gods
sake
what
will
our
russiaour
mothersay
seeing
that
we
are
so
frightened
and
that
we
are
giving
up
such
a
good
and
zealous
fatherland
to
such
rabble
and
instilling
hatred
and
disgrace
in
every
subject
why
are
we
cowardly
and
who
are
we
afraid
of
it
is
not
my
fault
that
the
minister
is
irresolute
cowardly
muddleheaded
temporizing
and
has
every
bad
quality
the
whole
army
is
completely
in
tears
and
scolds
him
to
death
vi
among
the
innumerable
subdivisions
that
can
be
made
in
the
phenomena
of
life
one
can
subdivide
them
all
into
those
in
which
content
predominates
and
those
in
which
form
predominates
among
the
latter
as
opposed
to
the
life
of
a
village
a
zemstvo
a
province
even
of
moscow
can
be
counted
the
life
of
petersburg
especially
its
salon
life
that
life
is
unchanging
since
1805
we
had
made
peace
and
quarreled
with
bonaparte
we
had
made
constitutions
and
unmade
them
yet
the
salon
of
anna
pavlovna
and
the
salon
of
h233l232ne
were
exactly
the
same
as
they
had
beenthe
one
seven
years
earlier
the
other
five
years
earlier
in
just
the
same
way
people
at
anna
pavlovnas
talked
with
perplexity
about
bonapartes
successes
and
saw
both
in
his
successes
and
in
the
indulgence
shown
him
by
european
sovereigns
a
malicious
conspiracy
aimed
solely
at
causing
unpleasantness
and
anxiety
in
the
court
circle
of
which
anna
pavlovna
was
the
representative
in
the
same
way
at
h233l232nes
whom
rumyantsev
himself
favored
with
his
visits
and
considered
a
remarkably
intelligent
woman
as
in
1808
so
in
1812
they
talked
with
rapture
about
the
great
nation
and
the
great
man
and
looked
with
regret
upon
the
rupture
with
france
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
who
gathered
in
h233l232nes
salon
should
end
in
peace
recently
after
the
sovereigns
arrival
from
the
army
some
sort
of
flurry
had
gone
on
in
these
opposing
salon
circles
and
there
had
been
some
sort
of
demonstrations
against
each
other
but
the
tendencies
of
the
circles
remained
the
same
in
anna
pavlovnas
circle
frenchmen
were
accepted
only
from
among
the
inveterate
legitimists
and
here
the
patriotic
thought
was
upheld
that
one
should
not
go
to
the
french
theater
and
that
maintaining
a
company
of
actors
cost
as
much
as
maintaining
an
entire
army
corps
military
events
were
eagerly
followed
and
the
most
advantageous
rumors
were
spread
about
our
army
the
profrench
circle
of
h233l232ne
and
rumyantsev
refuted
the
rumors
about
the
cruelty
of
the
enemy
and
the
war
and
discussed
all
of
napoleons
attempts
at
reconciliation
this
circle
reproached
those
who
advised
overly
hasty
arrangements
to
do
with
preparing
the
court
and
the
girls
institutes
under
the
dowager
empresss
patronage
for
departure
to
kazan
in
general
the
whole
matter
of
the
war
was
presented
in
h233l232nes
salon
as
empty
demonstrations
which
would
quite
soon
end
in
peace
and
there
reigned
the
opinion
of
bilibin
now
in
petersburg
and
a
familiar
at
h233l232nes
every
intelligent
person
had
to
be
received
in
her
salon
that
the
matter
would
be
resolved
not
by
gunpowder
but
by
those
who
invented
it
this
circle
ironically
and
quite
intelligently
though
also
quite
cautiously
laughed
at
the
moscow
raptures
news
of
which
had
come
to
petersburg
with
the
sovereign
in
anna
pavlovnas
circle
those
raptures
on
the
contrary
were
admired
and
spoken
of
as
plutarch
speaks
of
the
ancients
prince
vassily
who
occupied
all
the
same
important
posts
was
the
connecting
link
between
the
two
circles
he
visited
ma
bonne
amie
anna
pavlovna
and
he
visited
dans
le
salon
diplomatique
de
ma
fille
and
often
in
his
ceaseless
moves
from
one
camp
to
the
other
became
confused
and
said
at
anna
pavlovnas
what
ought
to
have
been
said
at
h233l232nes
and
vice
versa
soon
after
the
sovereigns
arrival
prince
vassily
got
to
talking
at
anna
pavlovnas
about
matters
of
the
war
harshly
denouncing
barclay
de
tolly
and
finding
himself
undecided
about
who
should
be
named
commander
in
chief
one
of
the
guests
known
under
the
name
of
un
homme
de
beaucoup
de
m233rite
having
told
how
he
had
seen
kutuzov
who
had
just
been
chosen
as
commander
of
the
petersburg
militia
sitting
in
the
treasury
office
over
the
enlistment
of
soldiers
allowed
himself
to
cautiously
voice
the
suggestion
that
kutuzov
might
be
the
man
who
would
satisfy
all
the
requirements
anna
pavlovna
smiled
sadly
and
observed
that
kutuzov
had
never
caused
the
sovereign
anything
but
trouble
i
said
over
and
over
at
the
assembly
of
the
nobility
prince
vassily
interrupted
but
they
didnt
listen
to
me
i
said
that
his
selection
as
commander
of
the
militia
wouldnt
please
the
sovereign
they
didnt
listen
to
me
its
all
some
sort
of
mania
for
fronding
he
went
on
and
before
whom
and
its
all
because
we
want
to
ape
those
stupid
moscow
raptures
said
prince
vassily
becoming
confused
for
a
moment
and
forgetting
that
at
h233l232nes
one
had
to
make
fun
of
the
moscow
raptures
but
at
anna
pavlovnas
to
admire
them
but
he
corrected
himself
at
once
well
is
it
suitable
for
count
kutuzov
the
oldest
general
in
russia
to
sit
in
an
office
et
il
en
restera
pour
sa
peine
is
it
possible
to
appoint
as
commander
in
chief
a
man
who
cannot
mount
a
horse
who
falls
asleep
at
a
council
a
man
of
the
lowest
morals
a
nice
reputation
he
made
for
himself
in
bucharest
im
not
even
speaking
of
his
qualities
as
a
general
but
is
it
possible
at
such
a
moment
to
appoint
a
man
who
is
decrepit
and
blind
plain
blind
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
blind
general
he
cant
see
a
thing
like
playing
blindmans
buffhe
sees
precisely
nothing
no
one
argued
against
that
on
the
twentyfourth
of
july
that
was
perfectly
correct
but
on
the
twentyninth
of
july
princely
dignity
was
bestowed
upon
kutuzov
princely
dignity
might
also
mean
that
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
himand
therefore
prince
vassilys
opinion
continued
to
be
correct
though
he
was
no
longer
in
a
hurry
to
voice
it
but
on
the
eighth
of
august
a
committee
was
assembled
made
up
of
general
field
marshal
saltykov
arakcheev
vyazmitinov
lopukhin
and
kochubey
to
discuss
matters
of
war
the
committee
decided
that
the
failures
came
from
multiplicity
of
command
and
though
the
persons
who
made
up
the
committee
knew
that
the
sovereign
was
illdisposed
towards
kutuzov
the
committee
after
a
brief
consultation
suggested
the
appointment
of
kutuzov
as
commander
in
chief
and
that
same
day
kutuzov
was
appointed
commander
in
chief
with
full
power
over
the
armies
and
the
entire
region
occupied
by
the
troops
on
the
ninth
of
august
prince
vassily
again

on
the
occasion
of
his
wish
to
be
appointed
a
trustee
of
the
empress
maria
feodorovnas
institute
for

prince
vassily
came
into
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
happy
victor
of
a
man
who
has
achieved
the
aim
of
his
desires

all

he
said
casting

and
stern

at
everyone
in
the
drawing

lhomme

despite
his
wish
to
obtain
a
post
could
not
help
reminding
prince

of
his
former
opinion
this
was
impolite
both
towards
prince
vassily
in
anna

drawing
room
and
towards
anna
pavlovna
who
had
received
the
news
with
as
much
joy
but
he
could
not
help
himself
mais
on
dit

he
said
reminding
prince
vassily
of
his
own
words

prince
vassily
said
in
his
brisk
bass
voice
with
a
little
cough
the
voice
and
the
little
cough
with
which
he
resolved
all
difficulties
allez
il
y

he
repeated
and
what
makes
me
glad
he
continued
is
that
the
sovereign
has
given
him
full
power
over
all
the
armies
over
the
entire
regiona
power
that
no
commander
in

has
ever
had
hes
another

he
concluded
with
a
victorious
smile

still
a

in

wishing
to
flatter

by
defending

on
this
judgment
said
they
say
the

gave

this
power
reluctantly

said

oh
no
no
prince
vassily
stepped
in
vehemently
now
he
could
not
yield
kutuzov
to
anybody
in
prince
vassilys
opinion
kutuzov
was
not
only
good
in
himself
but
everyone
adored
him
no
that
cant
be
because
the
sovereign
was
able
to
value
him
so
much
before
he
said
god

only
said
anna

that
prince
kutuzov
may
exercise
real
power
without
letting
anyone
put

his

prince
vassily
understood
at
once
who
this
anyone
was
he
said
in
a
whisper
i
know
for
certain
that
kutuzov
stated
as
an
absolute
condition
that
the
grand
duke
should
not
be
with
the
army
vous

and
prince
vassily
repeated
the
words
kutuzov
was
supposed
to
have
said
to
the
sovereign
i
can
neither
punish
him
if
he
does
wrong
nor
reward
him
if
he
does
well
oh

who
did
not
yet
have
courtly
tact
that
his
excellency
laid
down
as
an
absolute
condition
that
the
sovereign
himself
not
come
to
the
army
as
soon
as
he
said
it
prince
vassily
and
anna
pavlovna
turned
away
from
him
in
an
instant
and
looked
at
each
other
sadly
with
a
sigh
at
his
na239vet233
vii
while
this
was
going
on
in
petersburg
the
french
had
already
passed
smolensk
and
were
moving
closer
and
closer
to
moscow
napoleons
historian
thiers
like
his
other
historians
says
trying
to
justify
his
hero
that
napoleon
was
lured
to
the
walls
of
moscow
involuntarily
he
is
right
as
all
historians
are
right
who
seek
explanations
of
historical
events
in
the
will
of
one
man
he
is
right
just
as
the
russian
historians
are
right
who
maintain
that
napoleon
was
lured
to
moscow
by
the
skill
of
the
russian
commanders
here
besides
the
law
of
retrospection
which
presents
all
the
past
as
a
preparation
for
the
accomplished
fact
there
is
also
a
reciprocity
that
confuses
the
whole
matter
a
good
player
who
loses
at
chess
is
genuinely
convinced
that
he
has
lost
because
of
a
mistake
and
he
looks
for
this
mistake
in
the
beginning
of
his
game
but
forgets
that
there
were
also
mistakes
at
every
step
in
the
course
of
the
game
that
none
of
his
moves
was
perfect
the
mistake
he
pays
attention
to
is
conspicuous
only
because
his
opponent
took
advantage
of
it
how
much
more
complex
is
the
game
of
war
which
takes
place
in
certain
conditions
of
time
and
where
no
single
will
is
guiding
lifeless
mechanisms
but
everything
is
the
result
of
numberless
collisions
of
various
wills
after
smolensk
napoleon
sought
a
battle
beyond
dorogobuzh
at
the
vyazma
then
at
tsarevozaimishche
but
it
turned
out
that
owing
to
numberless
collisions
of
circumstances
the
russians
could
not
accept
battle
before
borodino
seventyfive
miles
from
moscow
from
the
vyazma
napoleon
gave
orders
to
move
directly
upon
moscow

no

the

on
his

accompanied
by

he
galloped
to

up

with

says
thiers
recounting
this
episode
in
fact
lavrushka
had
received
a
whipping
the
day
before
for
getting
drunk
and
leaving
his
master
without
dinner
and
had
been
sent
to
a
village
to
get
some
chickens
and
there
carried
away
by
pillaging
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
french
lavrushka
was
one
of
those
coarse
insolent
lackeys
who
had
been
around
who
considered
it
their
duty
to
do
everything
with
meanness
and
cunning
who
were
ready
to
perform
any
service
for
their
master
and
who
cunningly
guess
their
masters
bad
thoughts
especially
the
vain
and
paltry
ones
finding
himself
in
the
company
of
napoleon
whose
person
he
recognized
very
well
and
easily
lavrushka
was
by
no
means
thrown
off
and
only
tried
wholeheartedly
to
be
of
service
to
his
new
masters
he
knew
very
well
that
this
was
napoleon
himself
and
the
presence
of
napoleon
could
not
throw
him
off
any
more
than
the
presence
of
rostov
or
of
a
sergeant
major
with
a
whip
because
there
was
nothing
he
could
be
deprived
of
either
by
a
sergeant
major
or
by
napoleon
he
blurted
out
everything
that
was
the
talk
among
the
orderlies
much
of
it
was
true
but
when
napoleon
asked
what
the
russians
thought
about
defeating
or
not
defeating
napoleon
lavrushka
narrowed
his
eyes
and
fell
to
thinking
he
saw
a
subtle
cunning
here
as
people
like
lavrushka
always
see
cunning
in
everything
so
he
frowned
and
paused
its
like
this
if
theres
a
battle
he
said
thoughtfully
and
at
the
soonest
then
thats
just
that
well
but
if
it
happens
three
days
after
that
same
date
then
it
means
that
same
battles
going
to
put
a
drag
on
things
this
is
how
it
was
translated
for
napoleon

lelorgne

conveyed
with
a
smile
napoleon
did
not
smile
though
he
was
clearly
in
the
most
cheerful
state
of
mind
and
asked
these
words
to
be
repeated
for
him
lavrushka
noticed
it
and
to
cheer
him
up
more
said
pretending
not
to
know
who
he
was
we
know
youve
got
bonaparte
hes
beaten
everybody
in

worldwell
but
with
us
things
are
different
he
said
not
knowing
himself
how
and
why
this
boastful
patriotism
had
slipped
into
his
words
towards
the
end
the
translator
conveyed
these
words
to
napoleon
without
the
end
and
bonaparte
smiled
le
jeune
cosaque
fit

son
puissant
interlocuteur
says
thiers
having
ridden
several
paces
in
silence
napoleon
turned
to
berthier
and
said
he
would
like
to
test
what
effect
would
be
produced
sur
cet
enfant
du
don
by
the
news
that
this
man
with
whom
the
enfant
du
don
was
speaking
was
the
emperor
himself
the
same
emperor
who
had
written
his
immortally
victorious
name
on
the
pyramids
the
news
was
conveyed
lavrushka
realizing
that
this
had
been
done
in
order
to
take
him
aback
and
that
napoleon
thought
he
would
become
frightened
so
as
to
cater
to
his
new
masters
instantly
pretended
to
be
amazed
dumbfounded
goggled
his
eyes
and
made
the
same
face
he
was
accustomed
to
make
when
taken
off
to
be
whipped

ordered
the
militia
assembled
in
the
villages
armed
them
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
commander
in
chief
in
which
he
informed
him
of
the
intention
he
had
taken
to
remain
in
bald
hills
to
the
last
and
to
defend
it
leaving
it
up
to
the
commander
whether
he
would
or
would
not
take
measures
to
defend
bald
hills
where
one
of
the
oldest
russian
generals
might
be
killed
or
taken
prisoner
and
he
announced
to
the
household
that
he
was
staying
in
bald
hills
but
while
staying
in
bald
hills
himself
the
prince
gave
orders
for
the
princess
and
dessales
to
be
sent
with
the
little
prince
to
bogucharovo
and
from
there
to
moscow
princess
marya
frightened
at
her
fathers
feverish
sleepless
activity
which
replaced
his
former
inertia
would
not
risk
leaving
him
alone
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
allowed
herself
to
disobey
him
she
refused
to
leave
and
the
terrible
thunder
of
the
princes
wrath
fell
upon
her
he
reminded
her
of
everything
in
which
he
had
been
unfair
to
her
trying
to
accuse
her
he
told
her
that
she
had
worn
him
out
that
she
had
caused
him
to
quarrel
with
his
son
that
she
had
had
nasty
suspicions
of
him
that
she
had
made
it
the
goal
of
her
life
to
poison
his
life
and
he
drove
her
out
of
his
study
telling
her
that
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
she
left
or
not
he
said
that
he
did
not
want
to
know
of
her
existence
but
gave
her
fair
warning
beforehand
that
she
dare
not
show
her
face
to
him
the
fact
that
contrary
to
her
apprehensions
he
did
not
have
her
taken
away
by
force
but
only
ordered
her
not
to
show
her
face
to
him
gladdened
princess
marya
she
knew
it
proved
that
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
was
glad
that
she
was
staying
at
home
and
not
leaving
the
day
after
nikolushkas
departure
the
old
prince
put
on
his
full
uniform
in
the
morning
and
prepared
to
go
to
the
commander
in
chief
the
carriage
was
already
at
the
porch
princess
marya
saw
him
leave
the
house
in
his
uniform
and
all
his
decorations
and
go
to
the
garden
to
hold
a
review
of
the
armed
peasants
and
domestics
princess
marya
was
sitting
by
the
window
listening
to
his
voice
coming
from
the
garden
suddenly
several
people
with
frightened
faces
came
running
up
the
avenue
princess
marya
ran
out
to
the
porch
down
the
garden
path
and
into
the
avenue
a
large
crowd
of
militiamen
and
domestics
was
moving
towards
her
and
in
the
middle
of
this
crowd
several
men
were
dragging
under
the
arms
a
little
old
man
in
a
uniform
and
decorations
princess
marya
ran
to
him
and
in
the
play
of
light
falling
in
small
circles
through
the
shade
of
the
linden
avenue
she
could
not
account
to
herself
for
the
change
that
had
come
over
his
face
the
one
thing
she
saw
was
that
the
former
stern
and
resolute
expression
of
his
face
had
been
replaced
by
an
expression
of
timidity
and
submission
seeing
his
daughter
he
moved
his
strengthless
lips
and
made
a
wheezing
sound
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
he
wanted
they
picked
him
up
carried
him
to
his
study
and
laid
him
on
that
very
couch
which
he
had
feared
so
much
lately
the
doctor
brought
that
same
evening
let
his
blood
and
announced
that
the
prince
had
had
a
stroke
on
the
right
side
to
remain
in
bald
hills
was
becoming
more
and
more
dangerous
and
the
day
after
the
stroke
the
prince
was
taken
to
bogucharovo
the
doctor
went
with
them
when
they
arrived
in
bogucharovo
dessales
and
the
little
prince
had
already
left
for
moscow
in
the
same
condition
neither
better
nor
worse
stricken
with
paralysis
the
old
prince
lay
for
three
weeks
in
bogucharovo
in
the
new
house
built
by
prince
andrei
the
old
prince
was
unconscious
he
lay
like
a
disfigured
corpse
he
ceaselessly
muttered
something
his
eyebrows
and
lips
twitching
and
it
was
impossible
to
know
whether
or
not
he
understood
what
was
going
on
around
him
one
thing
could
be
known
for
certainthat
he
was
suffering
and
still
felt
a
need
to
express
something
but
what
it
was
no
one
could
understand
was
it
some
whim
of
a
sick
and
halfdemented
man
did
it
have
to
do
with
the
general
course
of
things
or
did
it
have
to
do
with
family
circumstances
the
doctor
said
that
the
anxiousness
he
showed
meant
nothing
that
it
had
physical
causes
but
princess
marya
thought
and
the
fact
that
her
presence
always
increased
his
anxiousness
confirmed
her
supposition
that
he
wanted
to
tell
her
something
he
was
obviously
suffering
both
physically
and
morally
there
was
no
hope
of
recovery
to
transport
him
was
impossible
what
would
happen
if
he
died
on
the
road
wouldnt
the
end
the
final
end
be
better
princess
marya
sometimes
thought
she
watched
over
him
day
and
night
almost
without
sleeping
and
dreadful
to
say
she
often
watched
over
him
not
hoping
to
find
signs
of
improvement
but
wishing
to
find
signs
of
the
approaching
end
strange
as
it
was
for
the
princess
to
be
aware
of
this
feeling
within
her
it
was
there
and
still
more
terrible
for
princess
marya
was
the
fact
that
since
the
time
of
her
fathers
illness
if
not
even
earlier
when
expecting
something
she
had
stayed
with
him
all
her
personal
desires
and
hopes
forgotten
and
dormant
in
her
had
reawakened
things
that
had
not
entered
her
head
for
yearsthoughts
of
a
free
life
without
the
eternal
fear
of
her
father
even
thoughts
of
the
possibility
of
love
and
family
happinessceaselessly
flitted
through
her
imagination
like
temptations
of
the
devil
try
as
she
might
to
push
them
away
from
her
questions
constantly
entered
her
head
of
how
she
would
arrange
her
life
now
after
that
these
were
temptations
of
the
devil
and
princess
marya
knew
it
she
knew
that
the
only
weapon
against
them
was
prayer
and
she
attempted
to
pray
she
stood
in
a
prayerful
position
looked
at
the
icons
recited
the
words
of
a
prayer
but
was
unable
to
pray
she
felt
that
now
another
world
had
taken
hold
of
herof
the
difficult
and
free
activity
of
everyday
life
completely
the
opposite
of
the
moral
world
in
which
she
had
previously
been
confined
and
in
which
the
best
consolation
had
been
prayer
she
could
not
pray
and
could
not
weep
and
everyday
cares
took
hold
of
her
it
was
becoming
dangerous
to
remain
in
bogucharovo
there
was
talk
on
all
sides
about
the
approaching
french
and
in
one
village
ten
miles
from
bogucharovo
an
estate
had
been
looted
by
french
marauders
the
doctor
insisted
that
the
prince
be
taken
further
away
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
sent
an
official
to
princess
marya
to
persuade
her
to
leave
as
soon
as
possible
a
police
chief
came
to
bogucharovo
and
insisted
on
the
same
thing
saying
that
the
french
were
twentyfive
miles
away
that
french
leaflets
were
going
about
the
villages
and
that
if
the
princess
and
her
father
did
not
leave
before
the
fifteenth
he
could
not
answer
for
anything
the
princess
decided
to
leave
on
the
fifteenth
the
cares
of
the
preparations
of
giving
orders
for
which
everyone
turned
to
her
occupied
her
the
whole
day
before
the
night
of
the
fourteenth
she
spent
as
usual
without
undressing
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
in
which
the
prince
lay
several
times
on
waking
up
she
heard
his
groaning
muttering
the
creaking
of
the
bed
and
the
footsteps
of
tikhon
and
the
doctor
as
they
turned
him
over
several
times
she
listened
at
the
door
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
muttered
more
loudly
than
usual
that
night
and
tossed
more
frequently
she
could
not
sleep
and
went
to
the
door
several
times
listening
wishing
to
go
in
and
not
daring
to
though
he
could
not
speak
princess
marya
saw
and
knew
how
unpleasant
he
found
any
sign
of
fear
for
him
she
noticed
with
what
displeasure
he
turned
away
from
the
intent
gaze
she
sometimes
involuntarily
directed
at
him
she
knew
that
her
coming
at
night
at
an
unusual
time
would
irritate
him
but
never
had
she
felt
so
sorry
for
him
so
frightened
of
losing
him
she
recalled
all
her
life
with
him
and
found
in
his
every
word
his
every
act
an
expression
of
his
love
for
her
from
time
to
time
amidst
these
memories
the
devils
temptations
would
break
in
upon
her
imagination
the
thoughts
of
what
would
happen
after
his
death
and
how
her
new
free
life
would
be
arranged
but
she
drove
those
thoughts
away
with
loathing
by
morning
he
quieted
down
and
she
fell
asleep
she
woke
up
late
that
sincerity
which
comes
with
waking
showed
her
clearly
what
it
was
in
her
fathers
illness
that
concerned
her
most
she
woke
up
listened
to
what
was
happening
behind
the
door
and
hearing
his
groaning
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
that
everything
was
still
the
same
but
what
else
could
there
be
what
did
i
want
i
want
his
death
she
cried
out
with
loathing
for
herself
she
dressed
washed
said
her
prayers
and
went
out
to
the
porch
at
the
porch
stood
carriages
without
horses
and
things
were
being
packed
into
them
the
morning
was
warm
and
gray
princess
marya
stopped
on
the
porch
never
ceasing
to
be
horrified
at
her
inner
loathsomeness
and
trying
to
put
her
thoughts
in
order
before
going
in
to
see
him
the
doctor
came
downstairs
and
went
out
to
her
hes
a
little
better
today
he
said
ive
been
looking
for
you
some
of
what
he
says
can
be
understood
his
head
is
clearer
come
along
hes
calling
for
you
princess
maryas
heart
beat
so
hard
at
this
news
that
she
turned
pale
and
leaned
against
the
doorway
so
as
not
to
fall
to
see
him
to
talk
to
him
to
have
him
look
at
her
now
when
her
whole
soul
was
filled
with
those
dreadful
criminal
temptations
was
painfully
joyful
and
terrible
come
along
said
the
doctor
princess
marya
entered
her
fathers
room
and
went
up
to
his
bed
he
lay
propped
up
on
his
back
his
small
bony
hands
covered
with
purple
knotty
veins
lying
on
the
covers
his
left
eye
looking
straight
ahead
his
right
squinting
to
one
side
his
eyebrows
and
lips
motionless
he
was
all
so
thin
small
and
pitiful
his
face
seemed
to
have
shriveled
or
melted
away
the
features
had
grown
smaller
princess
marya
went
up
and
kissed
his
hand
his
left
hand
pressed
hers
so
hard
that
it
was
clear
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
her
he
pulled
at
her
hand
and
his
eyebrows
and
lips
twitched
angrily
she
looked
at
him
in
fear
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
from
her
when
she
changed
her
position
so
that
his
left
eye
could
see
her
face
he
calmed
down
and
did
not
take
his
gaze
from
her
for
several
seconds
then
his
lips
and
tongue
moved
sounds
came
out
and
he
began
to
speak
looking
at
her
timidly
and
imploringly
clearly
afraid
that
she
would
not
understand
him
princess
marya
straining
all
her
powers
of
attention
looked
at
him
the
comic
effort
with
which
he
moved
his
tongue
made
princess
marya
lower
her
eyes
and
force
herself
to
suppress
the
sobs
that
rose
in
her
throat
he
said
something
repeating
his
words
several
times
princess
marya
could
not
understand
them
but
she
tried
to
guess
what
he
was
saying
and
repeated
questioningly
the
words
he
had
said
to
her
masaeheh
he
repeated
several
times
she
could
not
understand
these
words
the
doctor
thought
he
could
and
repeating
his
words
asked
marya
afraid
the
prince
shook
his
head
negatively
and
again
repeated
the
same
thing
my
soul
my
soul
aches
princess
marya
guessed
and
said
he
grunted
affirmatively
took
her
hand
and
began
pressing
it
to
various
places
on
his
chest
as
if
trying
to
find
the
right
place
for
it
all
thoughts
of
youthoughts
he
then
pronounced
much
more
clearly
and
understandably
than
before
now
that
he
was
sure
they
understood
him
princess
marya
pressed
her
head
to
his
hand
trying
to
hide
her
sobs
and
tears
he
moved
his
hand
over
her
hair
i
was
calling
you
all
night
he
brought
out
if
only

she
said
through
her
tears
i
was
afraid
to
come
in
he
pressed
her
hand
you
werent

said
princess
marya
shaking
her
head
negatively
involuntarily
submitting
to
her
father
she
now
spoke
the
way
he
did
trying
to
speak
more
in
signs
and
as
if
also
moving
her
tongue
with
difficulty
dear
heartor
dear
friend
princess
marya
could
not
make
it
out
but
certainly
by
the
expression
of
his
gaze
it
was
a
tender
caressing
word
such
as
he
had
never
spoken
before
why
didnt
you
come
and
i
was
wishing
wishing
for
his
death
thought
princess
marya
he
fell
silent
thank
youdaughter
dear
friendfor
everything
everythingforgive
methank
youforgive
methank
you
and
tears
flowed
from
his
eyes
call
andryusha
he
said
suddenly
and
something
childishly
timid
and
mistrustful
showed
in
his
face
as
he
made
this
request
it
was
as
if
he
knew
himself
that
his
request
made
no
sense
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
princess
marya
i
received
a
letter
from
him
she
replied
he
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
and
timidity
where
is
he
hes
in
the
army
mon
p232re
in
smolensk
he
fell
silent
for
a
long
time
closing
his
eyes
then
he
nodded
his
head
affirmatively
as
if
in
response
to
his
doubts
and
to
confirm
that
he
now
understood
and
remembered
everything
and
opened
his
eyes
yes
he
said
distinctly
and
softly
russias
lost
theyve
lost
her
and
again
he
sobbed
and
the
tears
flowed
from
his
eyes
princess
marya
could
no
longer
help
herself
and
also
wept
looking
at
his
face
he
closed
his
eyes
again
his
sobbing
stopped
he
gestured
towards
his
eyes
tikhon
understood
and
wiped
his
tears
then
he
opened
his
eyes
and
said
something
that
no
one
could
understand
for
a
long
time
and
that
tikhon
alone
finally
understood
and
explained
princess
marya
sought
the
meaning
of
his
words
in
the
mood
in
which
he
had
spoken
a
moment
before
first
she
thought
he
was
speaking
of
russia
then
of
prince
andrei
then
of
her
of
his
grandson
of
his
death
and
that
kept
her
from
guessing
his
words
put
on
your
white
dress
i
like
it
he
had
said
having
understood
these
words
princess
marya
burst
into
still
louder
sobs
and
the
doctor
taking
her
by
the
arm
led
her
from
the
room
to
the
terrace
persuading
her
to
calm
down
and
busy
herself
with
the
preparations
for
departure
after
princess
marya
left
the
prince
he
again
began
talking
about
his
son
about
the
war
the
sovereign
twitched
his
eyebrows
angrily
began
raising
his
hoarse
voice
and
had
a
second
and
final
stroke
princess
marya
stopped
on
the
terrace
the
day
had
cleared
it
was
sunny
and
hot
she
could
not
understand
anything
or
think
about
anything
or
feel
anything
except
her
passionate
love
for
her
father
a
love
which
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
not
known
till
that
moment
she
ran
out
to
the
garden
and
sobbing
ran
down
to
the
pond
along
a
path
lined
with
young
lindens
planted
by
prince
andrei
yesiii
i
wished
for
his

wont

there
princess
marya
murmured
aloud
pacing
the
garden
with
quick
steps
her
arms
pressed
to
her
breast
from
which
sobs
burst
convulsively
making
a
circle
around
the
garden
which
led
her
back
to
the
house
she
saw
mlle
bourienne
coming
towards
her
she
had
stayed
on
at
bogucharovo
and
did
not
want
to
leave
and
an
unknown
man
with
her
it
was
the
marshal
of
the
district
nobility
who
had
come
in
person
to
the
princess
in
order
to
present
to
her
all
the
necessity
of
a
speedy
departure
princess
marya
listened
and
did
not
understand
him
she
led
him
to
the
house
offered
him
lunch
and
sat
down
with
him
then
apologizing
to
the
marshal
she
went
to
the
old
princes
door
the
doctor
came
out
to
her
with
an
alarmed
face
and
said
she
could
not
come
in
go
away
princess
go
away

away
princess
marya
went
back
to
the
garden
and
sat
down
in
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
by
the
pond
where
no
one
could
see
her
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
stayed
there
a
womans
footsteps
running
down
the
path
brought
her
to
her
senses
she
stood
up
and
saw
that
dunyasha
her
maid
who
had
evidently
come
running
to
fetch
her
had
suddenly
stopped
as
if
frightened
at
seeing
her
mistress

princessthe
prince
dunyasha
said
in
a
faltering
voice
at
once

the
princess
said
hurriedly
not
giving
dunyasha
time
to
finish
what
she
had
to
say
and
trying
not
to
see
dunyasha
she
ran
towards
the
house
princess
gods
will

being
done
you
must
be
prepared
for
anything
said
the
marshal
meeting
her
at
the
front
door
let
me
be
its
not
true
she
shouted
at
him
angrily
the
doctor
wanted
to
stop
her
she
pushed
him
away
and
ran
up
to
the
door
why
do
these
people
with
frightened
faces
stop
me
i
dont
need
anybody
what
are
they
doing
here
she
opened
the
door
and
was
terrified
by
the
bright
daylight
in
this
previously
semidark
room
there
were
women
in
the
room
and
the
nanny
they
all
stepped
back
from
the
bed
making
way
for
her
he
lay
on
the
bed
in
the
same
way
but
the
stern
look
of
his
calm
face
stopped
princess
marya
on
the
threshold
no
he
hasnt
died
it
cant
be
princess
marya
said
to
herself
went
up
to
him
and
overcoming
the
horror
that
seized
her
pressed
her
lips
to
his
cheek
but
she
drew
back
from
him
at
once
instantly
the
whole
force
of
the
tenderness
for
him
which
she
felt
in
herself
vanished
and
was
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
horror
at
what
lay
before
her
no
hes
no
more
hes
no
more
and
in
the
place
where
he
was
there
is
something
alien
and
hostile
some
dreadful
terrifying
and
repulsive
mystery
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
princess
marya
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
doctor
who
supported
her
in
the
presence
of
tikhon
and
the
doctor
the
women
washed
what
had
been
he
bound
his
head
with
a
handkerchief
so
that
the
open
mouth
would
not
stiffen
and
with
another
handkerchief
bound
together
the
legs
which
were
beginning
to
spread
then
they
dressed
the
small
shriveled
body
in
the
uniform
with
decorations
and
laid
it
out
on
the
table
god
knows
who
took
care
of
it
or
when
but
everything
got
done
as
if
by
itself
towards
nighttime
candles
were
burning
around
the
coffin
on
the
coffin
lay
a
pall
the
floor
was
strewn
with
juniper
boughs
under
the
dead
mans
withered
head
a
printed
prayer
had
been
placed
and
in
the
corner
sat
a
beadle
reading
the
psalter
as
horses
shy
crowd
and
snort
over
a
dead
horse
so
people
crowded
around
the
coffin
in
the
drawing
roomstrangers
and
familiars
the
marshal
and
the
headman
and
peasant
womenand
all
with
a
fixed
and
frightened
gaze
crossed
themselves
and
bowed
and
kissed
the
cold
and
stiffened
hand
of
the
old
prince
ix
bogucharovo
before
prince
andrei
settled
there
had
always
been
an
absentee
estate
and
the
bogucharovo
peasants
had
quite
a
different
character
from
those
of
bald
hills
they
differed
from
them
in
speech
dress
and
disposition
they
were
called
steppe
folk
the
old
prince
had
praised
them
for
their
endurance
at
work
when
they
came
to
help
out
with
the
harvest
at
bald
hills
or
to
dig
ponds
and
ditches
but
had
disliked
them
for
their
wildness
prince
andreis
last
stay
in
bogucharovo
with
his
innovationsclinics
schools
and
the
reducing
of
the
quitrenthad
not
softened
their
disposition
but
on
the
contrary
had
increased
in
them
the
traits
of
character
which
the
old
prince
called
wildness
among
them
there
was
always
some
vague
talk
going
around
now
about
enlisting
them
all
as
cossacks
now
about
a
new
faith
to
which
they
were
to
be
converted
now
about
some
charters
from
the
tsars
now
about
an
oath
to
pavel
petrovich
in
1797
of
which
it
was
said
that
they
had
already
been
granted
their
freedom
then
but
that
the
landowners
had
taken
it
away
now
about
pyotr
feodorovich
who
was
to
begin
to
reign
in
seven
years
and
under
whom
everything
would
be
free
and
so
simple
that
there
would
be
nothing
at
all
the
rumors
of
war
and
bonaparte
and
his
invasion
combined
for
them
with
equally
vague
notions
of
the
antichrist
the
end
of
the
world
and
pure
freedom
the
neighborhood
of
bogucharovo
was
all
large
villages
belonging
to
the
crown
or
to
absentee
landowners
very
few
landowners
actually
lived
there
there
were
also
very
few
domestic
and
literate
serfs
and
in
the
lives
of
the
peasants
in
this
area
there
appeared
more
noticeably
and
strongly
than
in
others
those
mysterious
currents
of
popular
russian
life
the
causes
and
meaning
of
which
are
inexplicable
for
contemporaries
one
of
those
phenomena
which
had
manifested
itself
among
the
peasants
of
that
locality
twenty
years
before
was
a
movement
to
migrate
to
some
warm
rivers
hundreds
of
peasants
bogucharovo
peasants
among
them
suddenly
began
selling
their
cattle
and
leaving
with
their
families
for
somewhere
in
the
southeast
as
birds
fly
somewhere
beyond
the
seas
these
people
with
their
wives
and
children
made
for
somewhere
there
in
the
southeast
where
none
of
them
had
ever
been
they
made
up
caravans
bought
themselves
out
one
by
one
ran
away
and
drove
and
walked
there
to
the
warm
rivers
many
were
punished
exiled
to
siberia
many
died
on
the
road
of
cold
and
hunger
many
came
back
of
themselves
and
the
movement
died
down
just
as
it
had
begun
without
any
obvious
reason
but
the
undercurrents
never
ceased
to
flow
among
these
people
and
were
gathering
some
sort
of
new
forces
in
order
to
manifest
themselves
just
as
strangely
and
unexpectedly
and
at
the
same
time
as
simply
naturally
and
strongly
now
in
the
year
1812
it
was
noticeable
for
a
man
living
close
to
the
people
that
these
undercurrents
were
intensely
at
work
and
were
close
to
manifesting
themselves
alpatych
having
come
to
bogucharovo
a
short
time
before
the
old
princes
passing
noticed
that
there
was
agitation
among
the
people
and
that
contrary
to
what
was
happening
in
the
region
of
bald
hills
where
over
a
fortymile
radius
all
the
peasants
were
going
away
leaving
their
villages
to
be
devastated
by
the
cossacks
in
the
steppe
region
of
bogucharovo
the
peasants
it
was
heard
had
communications
with
the
french
received
some
sort
of
leaflets
that
circulated
among
them
and
were
staying
put
he
knew
through
the
domestic
servants
who
were
devoted
to
him
that
the
muzhik
karp
who
had
great
influence
on
the
community
had
made
a
trip
in
a
governmentowned
cart
the
other
day
and
come
back
with
the
news
that
the
cossacks
devastated
villages
abandoned
by
their
inhabitants
but
that
the
french
did
not
touch
them
he
knew
that
another
muzhik
the
evening
before
had
even
brought
from
the
village
of
visloukhovowhere
the
french
were
campeda
leaflet
from
a
french
general
which
announced
to
the
inhabitants
that
no
harm
would
be
done
them
and
that
whatever
was
taken
from
them
would
be
paid
for
if
they
stayed
as
proof
of
it
the
muzhik
brought
from
visloukhovo
a
hundred
roubles
in
banknotes
not
knowing
they
were
counterfeit
which
he
had
been
paid
in
advance
for
hay
finally
most
important
of
all
alpatych
learned
that
on
the
same
day
that
he
ordered
the
headman
to
prepare
carts
for
transporting
the
princesss
baggage
from
bogucharovo
there
had
been
a
meeting
of
the
village
in
the
morning
at
which
it
had
been
decided
to
wait
and
not
go
anywhere
and
meanwhile
time
was
running
out
the
marshal
insisted
on
the
fifteenth
of
august
the
day
of
the
princes
death
that
princess
marya
should
leave
that
same
day
as
it
was
becoming
dangerous
he
said
that
after
the
sixteenth
he
could
not
answer
for
anything
on
the
day
of
the
princes
death
he
left
in
the
evening
but
promised
to
come
for
the
funeral
the
next
day
but
the
next
day
he
could
not
come
because
according
to
news
he
had
received
the
french
had
advanced
unexpectedly
and
he
had
barely
managed
to
remove
his
family
and
all
his
valuables
from
his
estate
for
thirty
years
bogucharovo
had
been
managed
by
the
headman
dron
whom
the
old
prince
had
called
dronushka
dron
was
one
of
those
physically
and
morally
sturdy
muzhiks
who
once
they
come
of
age
and
grow
a
beard
live
on
that
way
unchanging
until
they
are
sixty
or
seventy
without
a
single
gray
hair
or
missing
tooth
as
straight
and
strong
at
the
age
of
sixty
as
at
thirty
dron
soon
after
the
migration
to
the
warm
rivers
in
which
he
had
taken
the
others
had
been
made
headman
and
mayor
of
bogucharovo
and
since
then
had
remained
in
those
duties
irreproachably
for
twentythree
years
the
muzhiks
feared
him
more
than
the
master
the
gentlemen
both
the
old
prince
and
the
young
and
the
steward
respected
him
and
jokingly
called
him
minister
in
all
the
time
of
his
service
dron
had
never
once
been
drunk
or
sick
never
either
after
sleepless
nights
or
after
any
sort
of
labor
had
he
shown
the
slightest
fatigue
and
though
illiterate
never
had
he
forgotten
a
single
accounting
of
money
and
sacks
of
flour
for
the
enormous
shipments
he
sold
nor
a
single
stack
of
grain
on
any
acre
of
the
bogucharovo
fields
it
was
this
dron
whom
alpatych
having
come
from
the
devastated
bald
hills
summoned
to
him
on
the
day
of
the
princes
funeral
and
ordered
to
prepare
twelve
horses
for
the
princesss
carriages
and
eighteen
carts
for
a
train
that
was
to
be
made
up
at
bogucharovo
though
the
peasants
there
were
on
quitrent
the
fulfillment
of
this
order
could
not
present
any
difficulties
in
alpatychs
opinion
because
there
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
households
at
bogucharovo
and
the
peasants
were
welltodo
but
the
headman
dron
having
heard
the
order
silently
lowered
his
eyes
alpatych
named
for
him
some
muzhiks
whom
he
knew
and
from
whom
he
ordered
the
carts
to
be
taken
dron
replied
that
those
muzhiks
had
their
horses
hired
out
alpatych
named
some
other
muzhiks
and
they
too
had
no
horses
according
to
dron
some
were
pulling
government
carts
others
were
too
weak
still
others
had
dropped
dead
from
lack
of
fodder
in
drons
opinion
it
was
impossible
to
collect
any
horses
not
only
for
the
carting
but
even
for
the
carriages
alpatych
looked
at
dron
attentively
and
frowned
just
as
dron
was
an
exemplary
headman
and
muzhik
so
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
alpatych
had
managed
the
princes
estates
for
twenty
years
and
was
an
exemplary
steward
he
was
capable
in
the
highest
degree
of
understanding
intuitively
the
needs
and
instincts
of
the
people
he
was
dealing
with
and
that
was
why
he
was
an
excellent
steward
having
glanced
at
dron
he
understood
at
once
that
drons
replies
were
not
the
expression
of
drons
thoughts
but
the
expression
of
that
general
mood
of
the
bogucharovo
community
in
which
the
headman
was
already
caught
up
but
along
with
that
he
knew
that
dron
grown
rich
and
therefore
hated
by
the
community
was
bound
to
waver
between
the
two
campsthe
masters
and
the
peasants
he
noticed
this
wavering
in
his
eyes
and
therefore
alpatych
frowned
and
moved
closer
to
dron
listen
dronushka
he
said
no
empty
talk
with
me
his
excellency
prince
andrei
nikolaich
himself
has
ordered
me
to
have
all
these
people
sent
away
and
not
left
to
the
enemy
and
theres
a
tsars
order
for
it
and
whoever
stays
is
a
traitor
to
the
tsar
do
you
hear
i
hear
dron
replied
without
raising
his
eyes
alpatych
was
not
satisfied
with
this
response
eh
dron
itll
go
badly
for
you
alpatych
said
shaking
his
head
the
powers
yours
dron
said
ruefully
drop
it
dron
said
alpatych
taking
his
hand
from
behind
his
lapel
and
pointing
with
a
solemn
gesture
at
the
floor
under
drons
feet
i
not
only
see
through
you
i
see
through
everything
seven
feet
under
you
he
said
staring
at
the
floor
under
drons
feet
dron
became
troubled
glanced
fleetingly
at
alpatych
and
again
lowered
his
eyes
drop
this
nonsense
and
tell
the
people
to
get
ready
to
leave
home
for
moscow
and
to
prepare
carts
tomorrow
morning
for
the
princesss
baggage
and
dont
go
to
any
meeting
do
you
hear
dron
suddenly
fell
at
his
feet
yakov
alpatych
release
me
take
the
keys
from
me
release
me
for
christs
sake
drop
it
alpatych
said
sternly
i
see
through
seven
feet
under
you
he
repeated
knowing
that
his
skill
in
beekeeping
his
knowledge
of
when
to
sow
oats
and
the
fact
that
for
twenty
years
he
had
been
able
to
please
the
old
prince
had
long
since
earned
him
the
reputation
of
a
sorcerer
and
that
the
ability
to
see
seven
feet
under
a
man
was
ascribed
to
sorcerers
dron
stood
up
and
was
about
to
say
something
but
alpatych
interrupted
him
whats
this
youve
got
into
your
heads
ehwhat
are
you
thinking
eh
what
can
i
do
with
the
people
said
dron
theyre
all
riled
up
i
did
tell
them
so
you
told
them
said
alpatych
drinking
he
asked
curtly
all
riled
up
yakov
alpatych
brought
a
second
barrel
listen
then
ill
go
for
the
police
chief
and
you
tell
that
to
the
people
and
that
they
should
drop
all
this
and
furnish
the
carts
yes
sir
replied
dron
yakov
alpatych
did
not
insist
further
he
had
been
managing
peasants
for
a
long
time
and
knew
that
the
main
means
of
getting
people
to
obey
consisted
in
not
showing
them
any
suspicion
that
they
might
not
obey
having
obtained
the
obedient
yes
sir
from
dron
yakov
alpatych
was
satisfied
with
that
though
he
not
only
suspected
but
was
almost
certain
that
the
carts
would
not
be
furnished
without
the
help
of
the
militia
and
indeed
no
carts
had
been
rounded
up
by
evening
in
the
village
there
was
again
a
meeting
by
the
pothouse
and
at
the
meeting
it
was
decided
to
drive
the
horses
into
the
forest
and
not
supply
any
carts
saying
nothing
about
it
to
the
princess
alpatych
ordered
his
own
baggage
that
he
had
brought
from
bald
hills
unloaded
and
those
horses
prepared
to
be
harnessed
to
the
princesss
carriages
and
he
himself
drove
to
the
authorities
x
after
her
fathers
funeral
princess
marya
locked
herself
up
in
her
room
and
refused
to
see
anyone
a
maid
came
to
the
door
to
tell
her
that
alpatych
had
come
to
ask
for
orders
about
the
departure
this
was
before
alpatychs
conversation
with
dron
princess
marya
got
up
from
the
couch
she
was
lying
on
and
through
the
closed
door
said
that
she
would
never
go
anywhere
and
asked
to
be
left
in
peace
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
princess
marya
was
lying
gave
on
the
west
she
lay
on
the
couch
facing
the
wall
and
fingering
the
buttons
on
the
leather
cushion
saw
nothing
but
that
cushion
and
her
vague
thoughts
were
concentrated
on
one
thing
she
was
thinking
of
the
irrevocability
of
death
and
of
her
own
inner
loathsomeness
which
she
had
not
known
about
till
then
and
which
had
shown
itself
during
her
fathers
illness
she
wanted
but
did
not
dare
to
pray
did
not
dare
to
address
herself
to
god
in
the
state
of
soul
she
was
in
she
lay
in
that
position
for
a
long
time
the
sun
went
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
its
slanting
evening
rays
shone
through
the
open
window
into
the
room
and
onto
the
morocco
cushion
princess
marya
was
looking
at
the
flow
of
her
thoughts
suddenly
stopped
she
unconsciously
sat
up
smoothed
her
hair
rose
and
went
to
the
window
involuntarily
breathing
in
the
coolness
of
the
clear
but
breezy
evening
yes
its
easy
for
you
to
admire
the
evening
now
hes
gone
and
nobody
will
hinder
you
she
said
to
herself
and
sinking
onto
a
chair
let
her
head
drop
to
the
windowsill
someone
called
her
name
in
a
tender
and
soft
voice
from
the
garden
side
and
kissed
her
on
the
head
she
glanced
up
it
was
mlle
bourienne
in
a
black
dress
and
weepers
she
quietly
approached
princess
marya
kissed
her
with
a
sigh
and
at
once
began
to
cry
princess
marya
glanced
around
at
her
she
remembered
all
her
former
clashes
with
her
her
jealousy
of
her
she
remembered
too
how
he
had
recently
changed
towards
mlle
bourienne
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
and
therefore
how
unfair
were
the
reproaches
she
had
made
to
her
in
her
heart
and
is
it
for
me
who
wished
for
his
death
to
judge
anyone
she
thought
princess
marya
vividly
pictured
the
position
of
mlle
bourienne
who
had
been
distanced
from
her
company
recently
and
who
at
the
same
time
depended
on
her
and
lived
in
a
house
not
her
own
and
she
felt
sorry
for
her
she
gave
her
a
meekly
questioning
look
and
held
out
her
hand
to
her
mlle
bourienne
at
once
began
to
cry
kiss
her
hand
and
speak
of
the
grief
that
had
befallen
the
princess
making
herself
a
sharer
in
that
grief
she
said
that
her
sole
consolation
in
her
grief
was
that
the
princess
allowed
her
to
share
it
with
her
she
said
that
all
the
old
misunderstandings
should
be
turned
to
naught
before
their
great
grief
that
she
felt
herself
pure
before
everyone
and
that
he
could
see
her
love
and
gratitude
from
there
the
princess
listened
to
her
without
understanding
her
words
but
glancing
at
her
from
time
to
time
and
listening
to
the
sounds
of
her
voice
your
position
is
doubly
terrible
dear
princess
said
mlle
bourienne
after
a
brief
pause
i
realize
that
you
could
not
and
cannot
think
about
yourself
but
my
love
for
you
obliges
me
to
do
sodid
alpatych
come
to
see
you
did
he
talk
with
you
about
leaving
she
asked
princess
marya
did
not
reply
she
did
not
understand
who
had
to
leave
and
for
where
is
it
possible
to
undertake
anything
to
think
about
anything
now
does
it
make
any
difference
she
did
not
reply
do
you
know
ch232re
marie
said
mlle
bourienne
do
you
know
that
we
are
in
danger
that
we
are
surrounded
by
the
french
to
leave
now
is
dangerous
if
we
go
were
almost
certain
to
be
taken
prisoner
and
god
knows
princess
marya
gazed
at
her
friend
without
understanding
what
she
was
talking
about
ah
if
anyone
knew
how
little
difference
it
makes
to
me
now
she
said
naturally
i
would
not
wish
to
leave
him
for
anythingalpatych
said
something
to
me
about
leavingtalk
with
him
theres
nothing
nothing
i
can
or
want
to
do
i
did
talk
with
him
he
hopes
we
will
manage
to
leave
tomorrow
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
now
to
stay
here
said
mlle
bourienne
because
youll
agree
ch232re
marie
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
soldiers
or
rebellious
muzhiks
on
the
road
would
be
terrible
mlle
bourienne
took
from
her
reticule
and
handed
to
the
princess
an
announcement
by
the
french
general
rameau
on
unusual
nonrussian
paper
that
the
inhabitants
should
not
abandon
their
homes
that
they
would
be
duly
protected
by
the
french
i
think
its
better
to
turn
to
this
general
said
mlle
bourienne
and
im
sure
youll
be
treated
with
due
respect
princess
marya
read
the
leaflet
and
her
face
twitched
with
dry
sobs
whom
did
you
get
this
from
she
asked
they
probably
found
out
that
i
have
a
french
name
mlle
bourienne
said
blushing
princess
marya
the
leaflet
in
her
hand
got
up
from
the
window
and
with
a
pale
face
went
to
prince
andreis
former
study
dunyasha
send
me
alpatych
dronushka
somebody
said
princess
marya
and
tell
amalia
karlovna
not
to
come
in
here
she
added
hearing
the
voice
of
mlle
bourienne
to
leave
quickly
quickly
leave
princess
marya
repeated
horrified
at
the
thought
that
she
might
remain
in
the
power
of
the
french
that
prince
andrei
should
learn
that
she
was
in
the
power
of
the
french
that
she
the
daughter
of
nikolai
andreich
bolkonsky
should
beg
mister
general
rameau
to
protect
her
and
be
her
benefactor
this
thought
horrified
her
made
her
shudder
blush
and
experience
fits
of
anger
and
pride
such
as
she
had
never
felt
before
all
that
was
painful
and
above
all
insulting
in
her
position
vividly
presented
itself
to
her
they
the
french
will
settle
in
this
house
mister
general
rameau
will
occupy
prince
andreis
study
will
amuse
himself
going
through
and
reading
his
letters
and
papers
mlle
bourienne
lui
fera
les
honneurs
de
bogucharovo
ill
be
given
a
small
room
as
a
favor
the
soldiers
will
devastate
my
fathers
fresh
grave
to
take
his
crosses
and
decorations
theyll
tell
me
about
their
victories
over
the
russians
theyll
feign
sympathy
with
my
grief
thought
princess
marya
not
according
to
her
own
mind
but
feeling
it
her
duty
to
think
for
herself
the
thoughts
of
her
father
and
brother
for
herself
personally
it
made
no
difference
where
she
stayed
or
what
happened
to
her
but
she
felt
herself
at
the
same
time
the
representative
of
her
late
father
and
of
prince
andrei
she
involuntarily
thought
their
thoughts
and
felt
their
feelings
whatever
they
would
have
said
whatever
they
would
have
done
now
she
felt
it
necessary
to
do
the
same
she
went
into
prince
andreis
study
and
trying
to
be
penetrated
by
his
thoughts
reflected
on
her
position
the
demands
of
life
which
she
had
considered
annihilated
by
her
fathers
death
suddenly
emerged
before
princess
marya
with
a
new
as
yet
unknown
force
and
gripped
her
agitated
flushed
she
paced
the
room
demanding
to
see
alpatych
then
mikhail
ivanovich
then
tikhon
then
dron
dunyasha
the
nanny
and
all
the
maids
could
tell
her
nothing
about
the
extent
to
which
what
mlle
bourienne
had
told
her
was
correct
alpatych
was
not
at
home
he
had
gone
to
the
authorities
the
architect
mikhail
ivanovich
when
summoned
appeared
before
princess
marya
with
sleepy
eyes
and
could
tell
her
nothing
with
the
same
smile
of
agreement
with
which
it
had
been
his
habit
over
fifteen
years
to
respond
without
expressing
his
own
opinion
to
the
old
princes
remarks
he
now
responded
to
princess
marya
so
that
nothing
definite
could
be
drawn
from
his
responses
the
old
valet
tikhon
when
summoned
came
with
a
sagging
and
sunken
face
which
bore
the
stamp
of
incurable
grief
answered
yes
maam
to
all
princess
maryas
questions
and
could
barely
hold
back
his
sobs
looking
at
her
finally
the
headman
dron
came
to
the
room
and
bowing
low
to
the
princess
stopped
on
the
threshold
princess
marya
walked
across
the
room
and
stopped
facing
him
dronushka
said
princess
marya
seeing
in
him
an
unquestionable
friend
the
same
dronushka
who
from
his
annual
trip
to
the
fair
in
vyazma
brought
back
each
time
a
gingerbread
he
bought
specially
and
handed
it
to
her
with
a
smile
dronushka
now
after
our
misfortune
she
began
and
fell
silent
unable
to
speak
further
we
all
walk
under
god
he
said
with
a
sigh
they
were
both
silent
dronushka
alpatych
has
gone
off
somewhere
i
have
no
one
to
turn
to
is
it
true
what
they
say
to
me
that
its
impossible
for
me
to
leave
why
shouldnt
you
leave
your
excellency
its
possible
to
leave
said
dron
they
tell
me
theres
danger
from
the
enemy
dear
heart
i
can
do
nothing
i
understand
nothing
i
have
nobody
with
me
i
want
to
leave
for
certain
during
the
night
or
early
tomorrow
morning
dron
was
silent
he
glanced
at
princess
marya
from
under
his
eyebrows
theres
no
horses
he
said
i
told
yakov
alpatych
so
why
arent
there
asked
the
princess
its
all
from
gods
punishment
said
dron
whatever
horses
there
were
got
taken
for
the
army
and
some
dropped
dead
its
been
such
a
year
not
just
for
feeding
horses
but
to
keep
from
starving
to
death
ourselves
as
it
is
they
sometimes
go
three
days
without
food
theres
nothing
theyre
completely
devastated
princess
marya
listened
attentively
to
what
he
said
to
her
the
muzhiks
are
devastated
they
have
no
bread
she
asked
starving
to
death
said
dron
its
not
just
carts
but
why
didnt
you
tell
me
dronushka
can
anything
be
done
ill
do
all
i
can
it
was
strange
for
princess
marya
to
think
that
now
at
a
moment
when
such
grief
filled
her
soul
there
could
be
rich
and
poor
people
and
that
the
rich
would
not
help
the
poor
she
had
vaguely
known
and
heard
that
there
was
the
masters
grain
and
that
it
could
be
given
to
the
muzhiks
she
also
knew
that
neither
her
brother
nor
her
father
would
have
refused
muzhiks
in
need
she
was
only
afraid
of
somehow
making
a
mistake
in
words
concerning
this
distributing
of
grain
to
the
muzhiks
which
she
wanted
to
order
she
was
glad
that
the
pretext
presented
itself
to
her
of
a
concern
which
made
it
not
shameful
for
her
to
forget
her
own
grief
she
started
asking
dronushka
for
details
about
the
needs
of
the
muzhiks
and
about
what
belonged
to
the
masters
of
bogucharovo
but
we
do
have
the
masters
grain
my
brothers
she
asked
the
masters
grain
is
all
there
dron
said
proudly
our
prince
told
us
not
to
sell
it
give
it
to
the
muzhiks
give
them
as
much
as
they
need
i
allow
it
in
my
brothers
name
said
princess
marya
dron
said
nothing
and
sighed
deeply
distribute
that
grain
among
them
if
it
will
be
enough
for
them
distribute
all
of
it
i
order
it
in
my
brothers
name
and
tell
them
whats
ours
is
also
theirs
we
dont
grudge
them
anything
tell
them
that
dron
looked
intently
at
the
princess
as
she
spoke
release
me

gods
sake

the
keys
taken
from
me
he
said
ive
served
for
twentythree
years

did

wrong
release
me
for
gods
sake
princess
marya
did
not
understand
what
he
wanted
from
her
and
what
he
was
asking
to
be
released
from
she
replied
that
she
had
never
doubted
his
devotion
and
that
she
was
ready
to
do
everything
for
him
and
for
the
muzhiks
xi
an
hour
later
dunyasha
came
to
the
princess
with
the
news
that
dron
had
come
and
that
all
the
muzhiks
on
the
princesss
order
had
assembled
by
the
barn
wishing
to
talk
with
their
mistress
but
i
never
called
them
said
princess
marya
i
only
told
dron
to
distribute
grain
to
them
only
for
gods
sake
dear
princess

dunyasha
but
yakov
alpatych

and

of
trick
the
princess
said
in
surprise

gods
sake
i
do
know

ask
the
nanny

princess
marya
call
dronushka
dron
came
and
confirmed
dunyashas
words
the
muzhiks
had
come
on
the
princesss
orders
but
i
never
called
them
said
the
princess
you

have
made
a
mistake
in
what
you
told
them
i
only
said
that
you
should
give
them
grain
dron
sighed
and
did
not
reply
if
you
order
it
theyll
go
away
he
said
no
no
ill
go
to
them
said
princess
marya
despite
the
protests
of
dunyasha
and
the
nanny
princess
marya
went
out
to
the
porch
dron
dunyasha
the
nanny
and
mikhail
ivanych
followed
her
they
probably
think
im
offering
them
grain
so
that
theyll
stay
here
and
that
ill
leave
myself
abandoning
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
french
thought
princess
marya
ill
promise
them
monthly
rations
and
quarters
on
the
estate
near
moscow
im
sure
andr233
would
do
still
more
in
my
place
she
thought
approaching
in
the
twilight
the
crowd
standing
on
the
green
by
the
barn
the
crowd
clustering
together
stirred
and
hats
were
quickly
taken
off
princess
marya
her
eyes
lowered
her
legs
getting
tangled
in
her
dress
went
up
close
to
them
so
many
different
old
and
young
eyes
were
directed
at
her
and
there
were
so
many
different
faces
that
princess
marya
did
not
see
any
one
face
and
feeling
it
necessary
to
talk
to
all
of
them
at
once
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
but
again
the
awareness
of
being
the
representative
of
her
father
and
brother
gave
her
strength
and
she
boldly
began
her
speech
i
am
very
glad
that
you
have
come
princess
marya
began
without
raising
her
eyes
and
feeling
how
fast
and
hard
her
heart
was
pounding
dronushka
told
me
that
you
have
been
devastated
by
the
war
that
is
our
common
grief
and
i
will
spare
nothing
to
help
you
i
am
leaving
myself
because
its
dangerous
here
now
and
the
enemy
is
closebecausei
am
giving
you
everything
my
friends
and
i
beg
you
to
take
everything
all
our
grain
so
that
you
wont
be
in
need
and
if
you
were
told
that
i
am
giving
you
grain
so
that
you
will
stay
here
that
is
not
true
on
the
contrary
i
beg
you
to
leave
with
all
your
possessions
for
our
estate
near
moscow
and
there
i
take
it
upon
myself
and
promise
you
that
you
will
not
be
in
need
you
will
be
given
houses
and
grain
the
princess
stopped
nothing
but
sighs
came
from
the
crowd
i
am
not
doing
it
of
myself
the
princess
went
on
i
am
doing
it
in
the
name
of
my
late
father
who
was
a
good
master
to
you
and
of
my
brother
and
his
son
she
stopped
again
no
one
broke
her
silence
ours
is
a
common
grief
and
we
shall
share
everything
all
that
is
mine
is
yours
she
said
looking
at
the
faces
that
stood
before
her
all
eyes
were
looking
at
her
with
the
same
expression
the
meaning
of
which
she
could
not
understand
whether
it
was
curiosity
devotion
gratitude
or
fear
and
mistrust
the
expression
on
all
the
faces
was
the
same
much
obliged
for
your
goodness
only
its
not
for
us
to
go
taking
the
masters
grain
said
a
voice
at
the
back
but
why
not
said
the
princess
no
one
answered
and
princess
marya
looking
over
the
crowd
noticed
that
now
all
the
eyes
she
met
were
lowered
at
once
why
dont
you
want
to
she
asked
again
no
one
answered
princess
marya
began
to
be
oppressed
by
this
silence
she
tried
to
catch
someones
eyes
why
dont
you
speak
the
princess
addressed
an
old
man
who
stood
in
front
of
her
leaning
on
a
stick
tell
me
if
you
think
something
else
is
needed
ill
do
everything
she
said
catching
his
eyes
but
he
as
if
angered
by
that
lowered
his
head
altogether
and
said
whats
there
to
agree
to
we
dont
need
your
grain
what
us
abandon
everything
we
dont
agree
we
dont
agreewere
sorry
for
you
but
were
not
in
agreement
you
go
by
yourself
came
from
different
sides
of
the
crowd
and
again
one
and
the
same
expression
appeared
on
all
the
faces
in
this
crowd
and
now
it
was
certainly
not
an
expression
of
curiosity
and
gratitude
but
of
angry
resolve
but
surely
you
havent
understood
princess
marya
said
with
a
sad
smile
why
dont
you
want
to
leave
i
promise
to
house
you
to
feed
you
and
here
the
enemy
will
devastate
you
but
her
voice
was
drowned
out
by
the
voices
of
the
crowd
were
not
in
agreement
let
them
devastate
us
we
dont
take
your
grain
were
not
in
agreement
princess
marya
again
tried
to
catch
someones
eyes
in
the
crowd
but
not
a
single
gaze
was
directed
at
her
they
obviously
avoided
her
eyes
she
felt
strange
and
awkward
see
what
clever
teaching
follow
her
into
bondage
wreck
your
houses
and
go
into
servitude
what
else
ill
give
you
my
grain
she
says
voices
said
in
the
crowd
princess
marya
lowering
her
head
left
the
circle
and
went
to
the
house
after
repeating
the
order
to
dron
to
have
the
horses
ready
for
departure
she
went
to
her
room
and
remained
alone
with
her
thoughts
xii
that
night
princess
marya
sat
for
a
long
time
by
the
open
window
in
her
room
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
muzhiks
talk
which
reached
her
from
the
village
but
she
was
not
thinking
about
them
she
felt
that
however
much
she
thought
about
them
she
could
not
understand
them
she
kept
thinking
about
one
thingher
grief
which
after
the
interruption
caused
by
the
cares
of
the
present
had
already
become
her
past
now
she
could
remember
she
could
weep
and
she
could
pray
as
the
sun
set
the
wind
died
down
the
night
was
still
and
fresh
towards
midnight
the
voices
began
to
subside
a
cock
crowed
the
full
moon
began
to
appear
from
behind
the
lindens
a
fresh
white
dewy
mist
rose
and
silence
now
reigned
over
the
village
and
the
house
one
after
another
she
imagined
pictures
of
the
recent
pasther
fathers
illness
and
his
last
moments
and
with
sad
joy
she
now
dwelt
on
those
images
driving
away
from
her
with
horror
only
the
one
last
picture
of
his
death
which
she
felt
unable
to
contemplate
even
in
her
imagination
at
this
still
and
mysterious
hour
of
the
night
and
these
pictures
appeared
before
her
with
such
clarity
and
detail
that
they
seemed
to
her
now
a
reality
now
the
past
now
the
future
then
she
vividly
pictured
the
moment
when
he
had
had
the
stroke
and
had
been
dragged
under
the
arms
from
the
garden
in
bald
hills
and
had
muttered
something
with
his
strengthless
tongue
twitched
his
gray
eyebrows
and
looked
at
her
anxiously
and
timidly
he
wanted
to
tell
me
even
then
what
he
told
me
on
the
day
of
his
death
she
thought
he
had
always
thought
what
he
told
me
and
here
princess
marya
remembered
in
all
its
details
that
night
at
bald
hills
on
the
eve
of
his
stroke
when
having
a
foreboding
of
disaster
she
had
stayed
with
him
against
his
will
she
had
not
slept
and
at
night
had
tiptoed
downstairs
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
flower
room
where
her
father
was
spending
that
night
had
listened
to
his
voice
in
a
suffering
weary
voice
he
was
saying
something
to
tikhon
he
evidently
wanted
to
talk
why
didnt
he
call
me
why
didnt
he
allow
me
to
be
there
instead
of
tikhon
princess
marya
wondered
then
and
now
now
hell
never
tell
anyone
all
that
was
in
his
soul
neither
for
him
nor
for
me
will
the
moment
ever
come
back
when
he
could
say
everything
he
wanted
to
say
and
i
not
tikhon
could
listen
and
understand
him
why
didnt
i
go
into
the
room
then
she
wondered
maybe
he
would
have
told
me
then
what
he
said
on
the
day
of
his
death
he
did
ask
twice
about
me
then
during
his
talk
with
tikhon
he
wanted
to
see
me
and
i
stood
there
outside
the
door
it
was
sad
it
was
hard
for
him
to
talk
with
tikhon
who
didnt
understand
him
i
remember
he
mentioned
liza
to
him
as
though
she
were
alivehe
had
forgotten
she
had
died
and
tikhon
reminded
him
that
she
was
no
more
and
he
cried
fool
it
was
hard
for
him
i
heard
from
outside
the
door
how
he
lay
down
groaning
on
his
bed
and
cried
loudly
my
god
why
didnt
i
go
in
then
what
would
he
have
done
to
me
what
would
i
have
lost
and
perhaps
then
he
would
have
been
comforted
and
would
have
told
me
his
word
and
princess
marya
said
aloud
the
endearing
words
he
had
said
to
her
on
the
day
of
his
death
deear
heeart
princess
marya
repeated
the
words
and
sobbed
with
tears
that
eased
her
soul
she
now
saw
his
face
before
her
not
the
face
she
had
known
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
which
she
had
always
seen
from
a
distance
but
the
facetimid
and
weakwhich
on
the
last
day
as
she
bent
close
to
his
mouth
to
hear
what
he
said
she
had
seen
for
the
first
time
close
up
with
all
its
wrinkles
and
details
dear
heart
she
repeated
what
was
he
thinking
when
he
said
those
words
what
is
he
thinking
now
the
question
suddenly
came
to
her
and
in
response
to
it
she
saw
him
before
her
with
the
expression
he
had
had
in
the
coffin
on
his
face
bound
with
a
white
handkerchief
and
the
horror
that
had
seized
her
then
when
she
had
touched
him
and
become
convinced
not
only
that
this
was
not
he
but
that
it
was
something
mysterious
and
repugnant
seized
her
now
she
wanted
to
think
about
other
things
wanted
to
pray
and
could
do
nothing
she
stared
wideeyed
at
the
moonlight
and
shadows
expected
every
second
to
see
his
dead
face
and
felt
that
the
silence
that
hung
over
the
house
and
within
it
held
her
fast
dunyasha
she
whispered
dunyasha
she
cried
in
a
wild
voice
and
tearing
free
of
the
silence
she
ran
to
the
maids
room
towards
the
nanny
and
maids
who
came
running
to
her
xiii
on
the
seventeenth
of
august
rostov
and
ilyin
accompanied
by
lavrushka
who
had
just
returned
from
captivity
and
a
hussar
orderly
leaving
their
camp
in
yankovo
ten
miles
from
bogucharovo
went
for
a
rideto
try
out
a
horse
ilyin
had
just
bought
and
to
see
if
there
was
any
hay
in
the
villages
for
the
past
three
days
bogucharovo
had
been
between
two
enemy
armies
so
that
the
russian
rear
guard
could
get
there
as
easily
as
the
french
vanguard
and
therefore
rostov
as
a
thoughtful
squadron
commander
wanted
to
avail
himself
of
whatever
provisions
had
been
left
in
bogucharovo
before
the
french
got
there
rostov
and
ilyin
were
in
the
most
cheerful
mood
on
the
way
to
bogucharovo
a
princely
estate
with
a
manor
house
where
they
hoped
to
find
a
large
staff
and
some
pretty
girls
they
either
questioned
lavrushka
about
napoleon
and
laughed
at
his
stories
or
raced
each
other
trying
out
ilyins
horse
rostov
had
no
idea
that
the
village
he
was
going
to
was
the
estate
of
that
bolkonsky
who
used
to
be
his
sisters
fianc233
rostov
and
ilyin
sent
their
horses
into
a
last
race
down
the
slope
before
bogucharovo
and
rostov
getting
ahead
of
ilyin
was
the
first
to
gallop
into
the
street
of
the
village
you
came
out
ahead
said
the
flushed
ilyin
yes
always
ahead
both
in
the
meadow
and
here
rostov
replied
stroking
his
lathered
don
horse
with
his
hand
and
id
have
outraced
you
on
this
frenchman
your
excellency
lavrushka
said
from
behind
calling
his
scrubby
cart
horse
a
frenchman
but
i
didnt
want
to
shame
you
they
rode
at
a
walk
towards
a
barn
by
which
a
large
crowd
of
muzhiks
was
standing
some
of
the
muzhiks
took
off
their
hats
some
without
taking
off
their
hats
looked
at
the
approaching
officers
two
tall
old
muzhiks
with
wrinkled
faces
and
sparse
beards
came
out
of
the
pothouse
and
smiling
swaying
and
singing
some
nonsensical
song
went
up
to
the
officers
fine
lads
said
rostov
laughing
got
any
hay
and
so
alike
said
ilyin
a
veeery
meeerry
taaalk
the
muzhiks
sang
away
with
blissful
smiles
one
muzhik
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
and
approached
rostov
whose
might
you
be
he
asked
frenchmen
ilyin
replied
laughing
heres
napoleon
himself
he
said
pointing
to
lavrushka
so
youd
be
russians
the
muzhik
asked
again
have
you
got
many
forces
here
asked
another
rather
short
muzhik
going
up
to
them
many
many
replied
rostov
but
why
are
you
gathered
here
he
added
is
there
a
feast
the
old
men
got
together
on
village
business
the
muzhik
replied
stepping
away
from
him
just
then
two
women
and
a
man
in
a
white
hat
appeared
on
the
road
from
the
manor
house
walking
towards
the
officers
the
one
in
pinks
mine
no
haggling
said
ilyin
noticing
dunyasha
resolutely
heading
towards
him
ours
lavrushka
said
to
ilyin
with
a
wink
what
do
you
want
my
beauty
said
ilyin
smiling
the
princess
asked
me
to
find
out
your
names
and
regiment
this
is
count
rostov
the
squadron
commander
and
i
am
your
obedient
servant
a
taaalky
taaalk
the
drunken
muzhik
sang
away
smiling
blissfully
and
looking
at
ilyin
talking
with
the
maid
following
dunyasha
alpatych
went
up
to
rostov
taking
off
his
hat
while
still
some
distance
away
i
make
so
bold
as
to
trouble
you
your
honor
he
said
respectfully
but
with
relative
scorn
for
the
youth
of
this
officer
and
putting
his
hand
behind
his
lapel
my
mistress
the
daughter
of
general
in
chief
prince
nikolai
andreevich
bolkonsky
who
passed
away
on
the
fifteenth
instant
being
in
difficulty
on
the
occasion
of
the
ignorance
of
these
persons
he
pointed
to
the
muzhiks
asks
you
kindlywould
you
be
so
good
alpatych
said
with
a
sad
smile
as
to
ride
off
a
little
for
it
is
not
so
convenient
in
front
of
alpatych
pointed
to
the
two
muzhiks
who
flitted
about
behind
him
like
gadflies
around
a
horse
ehalpatycheh
yakov
alpatycha
grand
thing
forgive
us
for
christs
sake
a
grand
thing
eh
the
muzhiks
said
smiling
joyfully
at
him
rostov
looked
at
the
drunken
old
men
and
smiled
or
perhaps
your
excellency
finds
this
amusing
yakov
alpatych
said
sedately
pointing
to
the
old
men
with
the
hand
not
put
behind
his
lapel
no
its
not
very
amusing
said
rostov
and
he
rode
aside
whats
the
matter
he
asked
i
make
so
bold
as
to
report
to
your
excellency
that
the
coarse
local
people
do
not
want
to
allow
our
mistress
to
quit
the
estate
and
threaten
to
unharness
the
horses
so
that
though
everything
has
been
packed
since
morning
her
excellency
cannot
leave
it
cant
be
cried
rostov
i
have
the
honor
of
reporting
the
real
truth
to
you
alpatych
confirmed
rostov
got
off
his
horse
and
turning
it
over
to
the
orderly
went
to
the
house
with
alpatych
questioning
him
about
the
details
of
the
matter
indeed
the
princesss
offer
of
grain
to
the
muzhiks
the
evening
before
and
her
talk
with
dron
and
to
the
gathering
had
so
spoiled
things
that
dron
had
definitively
handed
over
the
keys
joined
the
muzhiks
and
refused
to
come
when
summoned
by
alpatych
and
in
the
morning
when
the
princess
ordered
them
to
harness
up
for
leaving
the
muzhiks
came
to
the
barn
in
a
large
crowd
and
sent
to
tell
the
princess
that
they
would
not
let
her
out
of
the
village
that
there
was
an
order
not
to
leave
and
that
they
would
unhitch
the
horses
alpatych
went
to
them
trying
to
bring
them
to
reason
but
they
answered
him
karp
did
most
of
the
talking
dron
did
not
appear
in
the
crowd
that
it
was
impossible
to
let
the
princess
go
that
there
was
an
order
about
it
but
let
the
princess
stay
and
they
would
serve
her
as
before
and
obey
her
in
everything
just
when
rostov
and
ilyin
came
galloping
down
the
road
princess
marya
despite
the
attempts
of
alpatych
the
nanny
and
the
maids
to
dissuade
her
had
ordered
the
harnessing
and
wanted
to
leave
but
seeing
the
two
cavalrymen
gallop
by
they
took
them
for
frenchmen
the
coachmen
fled
and
the
women
in
the
house
began
to
weep
dearest
my
dearest
god
has
sent
you
deeply
moved
voices
were
saying
as
rostov
passed
through
the
front
hall
princess
marya
at
a
loss
and
strengthless
was
sitting
in
the
reception
room
when
rostov
was
brought
to
her
she
did
not
understand
who
he
was
or
why
he
was
there
or
what
would
happen
to
her
seeing
his
russian
face
and
recognizing
him
by
the
way
he
walked
in
and
by
his
first
words
as
a
person
of
her
own
circle
she
looked
at
him
with
her
deep
and
luminous
gaze
and
began
to
speak
in
a
faltering
voice
trembling
with
agitation
rostov
immediately
imagined
something
romantic
in
this
encounter
a
defenseless
griefstricken
girl
alone
left
to
the
mercy
of
coarse
mutinous
muzhiks
and
what
a
strange
fate
has
pushed
me
to
come
here
thought
rostov
listening
to
her
and
looking
at
her
and
what
meekness
what
nobility
in
her
features
and
expression
he
thought
listening
to
her
timid
account
when
she
mentioned
that
it
had
all
happened
the
day
after
her
fathers
funeral
her
voice
trembled
she
turned
away
and
then
as
if
fearing
that
rostov
might
take
her
words
for
a
wish
to
move
him
to
pity
her
gave
him
a
questioningly
frightened
glance
tears
welled
up
in
rostovs
eyes
princess
marya
noticed
it
and
looked
at
rostov
gratefully
with
that
luminous
gaze
which
made
one
forget
the
plainness
of
her
face
i
cannot
express
to
you
princess
how
happy
i
am
that
i
have
come
here
accidentally
and
will
be
in
a
position
to
show
you
my
readiness
rostov
said
getting
up
go
please
and
i
will
answer
to
you
on
my
honor
that
not
a
single
person
will
dare
cause
you
any
trouble
if
only
you
will
allow
me
to
escort
you
and
bowing
respectfully
as
one
bows
to
a
lady
of
royal
blood
he
went
to
the
door
with
the
respectfulness
of
his
tone
rostov
seemed
to
be
showing
that
though
he
would
consider
himself
fortunate
to
make
her
acquaintance
he
did
not
want
to
use
the
occasion
of
her
misfortune
to
become
closer
to
her
princess
marya
understood
and
appreciated
that
tone
i
am
very
very
grateful
to
you
the
princess
said
to
him
in
french
but
i
hope
it
was
all
a
misunderstanding
and
that
no
one
is
to
blame
for
it
the
princess
suddenly
began
to
cry
excuse
me
she
said
rostov
frowned
gave
her
one
more
low
bow
and
left
the
room
xiv
well
what
is
she
pretty
no
brother
my
pink
ones
lovely
and
her
name
is
dunyasha
but
glancing
at
rostovs
face
ilyin
fell
silent
he
saw
that
his
hero
and
commander
was
in
quite
a
different
frame
of
mind
rostov
gave
ilyin
an
angry
look
and
without
replying
headed
at
a
quick
pace
for
the
village
ill
show
them
ill
give
it
to
them
the
brigands
he
was
saying
to
himself
alpatych
gliding
along
all
but
running
followed
behind
rostov
barely
keeping
up
with
him
what
decision
have
you
been
pleased
to
take
he
asked
catching
up
with
him
rostov
stopped
and
clenching
his
fists
suddenly
turned
on
alpatych
threateningly
decision
what
decision
you
old
cod
he
yelled
at
him
where
were
you
looking
eh
the
muzhiks
are
rebellious
and
you
cant
handle
them
youre
a
traitor
yourself
i
know
you
all
ill
have
your
hides
and
as
if
fearing
to
expend
his
store
of
anger
uselessly
he
left
alpatych
and
quickly
went
on
alpatych
suppressing
his
offended
feeling
glided
hurriedly
after
rostov
and
went
on
telling
him
his
reflections
he
said
that
the
peasants
were
obdurate
that
at
the
present
moment
it
was
not
sensible
to
antagonorize
them
with
no
military
detachment
around
that
it
would
be
better
to
send
for
a
detachment
first
ill
give
them
an
army
detachmentill
antagonize
them
nikolai
muttered
senselessly
choking
with
unreasonable
animal
anger
and
the
need
to
vent
that
anger
without
considering
what
he
was
going
to
do
unconsciously
at
a
quick
resolute
pace
he
moved
towards
the
crowd
and
the
closer
he
came
to
it
the
more
alpatych
felt
that
his
unreasonable
action
might
produce
good
results
the
muzhiks
in
the
crowd
had
the
same
feeling
looking
at
his
quick
and
firm
stride
and
resolute
frowning
face
after
the
hussars
rode
into
the
village
and
rostov
went
to
the
princess
confusion
and
discord
arose
in
the
crowd
some
of
the
muzhiks
began
to
say
that
the
men
who
had
come
were
russian
and
might
take
offense
that
the
young
lady
was
not
allowed
to
leave
dron
was
of
the
same
opinion
but
as
soon
as
he
expressed
it
karp
and
some
other
muzhiks
fell
upon
the
former
headman
how
many
years
have
you
been
feeding
off
the
community
karp
yelled
at
him
its
all
the

shouted
another
it
was
your
sons
turn
but
no

sorry
for

a
little
old

dron
so

a
nice
paunch
the
two
tall
muzhiks
were
having
their
say
as
soon
as
rostov
accompanied
by
ilyin
lavrushka
and
alpatych
came
up
to
the
crowd
karp
putting
his
fingers
behind
his
belt
smiling
slightly
stepped
forward
dron
on
the
contrary
went
to
the
back
rows
and
the
crowd
closed
in
more
tightly
hey

headman

shouted
rostov
coming
up
to
the
crowd
with
quick
strides
our
headman
what
do
you
want
him
for
asked
karp
but
before
he
finished
speaking
his
hat
went
flying
and
his
head
rocked
sideways
from
a
strong
blow
hats
off
traitors
cried
the
fullblooded
voice
of
rostov
wheres
the
headman
he
shouted
furiously

began
coming
off
of
heads

karp
and
several
voices
from

at
the
same
time
its
like

old
men
decidedtheres
lots
of
you

voice

he
shouted
though
there
was
no
one
to

him
except
lavrushka
and
alpatych
lavrushka
however
ran
up
to
karp
and
seized
his
arms
from
behind

hill
he
shouted
alpatych
turned
to
the
muzhiks
calling
two
by
name
to
come
and
bind
karp
the
muzhiks
obediently
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
and
began
taking
off
their
belts
wheres
the
headman
cried
rostov
dron
with
a
frowning
and
pale
face
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
youre
the
headman
bind
him
lavrushka
cried
rostov
as
if
this
order
too
could
meet
with
no
hindrance
and
in
fact
two
more
muzhiks
began
to
bind
dron
who
as
if
to
help
them
took
off
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
them
and
you
all
listen
to
me
rostov
turned
to
the
muzhiks
march
off
to
your
homes
right
now
and
dont
let
me
hear
a
peep
from
you
why
we
didnt
do
any
harm
it
was
just
out
of
stupidity
just
a
lot
of
nonsensei
kept
saying
it
was
wrong
voices
were
heard
reproaching

other
its
just
as
i
told
to
you
said
alpatych
entering
into
his
rights
it
wasnt
nice
boys
our
own
stupidity
yakov
alpatych
voices
responded
and
the
crowd
immediately
began
to
break
up
and
scatter
through
the
village
the
two
bound
muzhiks
were
taken
to
the
yard
of
the
manor
house
the
two
drunken
muzhiks
followed
eh
just
look
at
you
one
of
them
said
addressing
karp
as
if
you
can
talk
like
that
with
the
masters
what
were
you
thinking
of
a
fool
the
other
confirmed
a
real
fool
two
hours
later
the
carts
stood
in
the
yard
of
the
bogucharovo
house
the
muzhiks
were
animatedly
carrying
out
the
masters
belongings
and
loading
them
on
the
carts
and
dron
freed
at
the
princesss
request
from
the
storeroom
in
which
he
had
been
locked
stood
in
the
yard
ordering
the
muzhiks
about
be
careful
how
you
set
it
down
said
one
of
the
muzhiks
a
tall
man
with
a
round
smiling
face
taking
a
chest
from
a
maids
hands
it
also
costs
money
if
you
throw
it
down
like
that
or
put
a
rope
on
it
itll
get
scuffed
i
dont
like
that
everything

be
honest
by
the
rules
like
this
under
a
bast
mat
and
covered
with
some
straw
there
thats
grand

a
real
load
boys
hefty
books
yes
they
wrote
and
didnt
dote
said
the
tall
roundfaced
muzhik
with
a
meaningful
wink
pointing
to
the
fat
dictionaries
that
lay
on
top
rostov
unwilling
to
thrust
his
acquaintance
upon
the
princess
did
not
approach
her
but
stayed
in
the
village
awaiting
her
departure
having
waited
until
princess
maryas
carriages
left
the
house
rostov
mounted
his
horse
and
accompanied
her
riding
as
far
as
the
road
occupied
by
our
troops
eight
miles
from
bogucharovo
in
yankovo
at
the
inn
he
respectfully
took
leave
of
her
for
the
first
time
allowing
himself
to
kiss
her
hand
shame
on
you
he
said
blushing
in
reply
to
princess
maryas
expression
of
gratitude
for
her
salvation
as
she
called
what
he
had
done
any
policeman
would
have
done
the
same
if
we
only
had
to
make
war
on
muzhiks
we
wouldnt
have
let
the
enemy
get
so
far
he
said
embarrassed
at
something
and
trying
to
change
the
subject
i
am
only
happy
to
have
had
the
chance
to
make
your
acquaintance
goodbye
princess
i
wish
you
happiness
and
consolation
and
wish
to
meet
you
under
happier
circumstances
if
you
dont
want
to
make
me
blush
please
dont
thank
me
but
the
princess
if
she
no
longer
thanked
him
with
words
thanked
him
with
the
whole
expression
of
her
face
radiant
with
gratitude
and
tenderness
she
could
not
believe
that
she
had
nothing
to
thank
him
for
on
the
contrary
for
her
it
was
unquestionable
that
if
he
had
not
been
there
she
would
certainly
have
perished
both
from
the
rebels
and
from
the
french
that
he
in
order
to
save
her
had
subjected
himself
to
the
most
obvious
and
terrible
dangers
and
it
was
still
more
unquestionable
that
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
and
noble
soul
who
had
been
able
to
understand
her
position
and
her
grief
his
kind
and
honest
eyes
with
tears
welling
up
in
them
at
that
time
when
she
herself
weeping
had
spoken
to
him
of
her
loss
would
not
leave
her
imagination
when
she
said
goodbye
to
him
and
was
left
alone
princess
marya
suddenly
felt
tears
in
her
eyes
and
here
not
for
the
first
time
a
strange
question
presented
itself
to
her
did
she
love
him
further
on
the
way
to
moscow
despite
the
fact
that
the
princesss
position
was
not
joyful
dunyasha
who
was
riding
in
the
carriage
with
her
noticed
more
than
once
that
the
princess
leaning
out
the
window
of
the
carriage
was
smiling
joyfully
and
sadly
at
something
well
what
if
i
really
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
thought
princess
marya
ashamed
as
she
was
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
first
with
a
man
who
perhaps
would
never
love
her
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
no
one
would
ever
know
of
it
and
that
she
would
not
be
to
blame
if
to
the
end
of
her
life
without
speaking
of
it
to
anyone
she
should
love
the
one
she
loved
for
the
first
and
last
time
sometimes
she
remembered
his
glances
his
sympathy
his
words
and
happiness
did
not
seem
impossible
to
her
and
it
was
then
that
dunyasha
noticed
her
smiling
looking
out
the
window
of
the
carriage
and
it
had
to
be
that
he
came
to
bogucharovo
and
at
that
very
moment
thought
princess
marya
and
his
sister
had
to
refuse
prince
andrei
and
in
all
of
that
princess
marya
saw
the
will
of
providence
the
impression
princess
marya
made
on
rostov
was
very
pleasant
whenever
he
remembered
her
he
became
cheerful
and
when
his
comrades
having
learned
of
his
adventure
in
bogucharovo
teased
him
with
having
gone
for
hay
and
picked
up
one
of
the
wealthiest
brides
in
russia
rostov
became
angry
he
became
angry
precisely
because
against
his
will
the
thought
of
marrying
the
meek
princess
marya
whom
he
found
pleasant
and
who
had
an
enormous
fortune
had
occurred
to
him
more
than
once
for
himself
personally
nikolai
could
not
have
wished
for
a
better
wife
than
princess
marya
his
marriage
to
her
would
make
for
the
happiness
of
the
countess
his
mother
and
would
straighten
out
the
affairs
of
his
father
and
it
would
evennikolai
felt
thismake
for
the
happiness
of
princess
marya
but
sonya
and
the
word
he
had
given
that
was
what
made
rostov
angry
when
they
teased
him
about
princess
bolkonsky
xv
having
taken
command
of
the
armies
kutuzov
remembered
prince
andrei
and
sent
him
an
order
to
report
to
headquarters
prince
andrei
arrived
in
tsarevozaimishche
on
the
same
day
and
at
the
same
time
of
day
that
kutuzov
held
the
first
review
of
the
troops
prince
andrei
stopped
in
the
village
at
the
house
of
the
priest
in
front
of
which
the
commander
in
chiefs
carriage
stood
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
gate
to
wait
for
his
serenity
as
everyone
now
called
kutuzov
from
the
field
beyond
the
village
one
could
hear
the
sounds
of
regimental
music
then
the
roaring
of
an
enormous
number
of
voices
shouting
hurrah
to
the
new
commander
in
chief
there
by
the
gate
ten
paces
from
prince
andrei
taking
advantage
of
the
princes
absence
and
the
splendid
weather
stood
two
orderlies
a
courier
and
a
butler
a
small
darkhaired
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
all
overgrown
with
mustaches
and
sidewhiskers
rode
up
to
the
gate
and
glancing
at
prince
andrei
asked
if
his
serenity
was
staying
there
and
when
he
would
be
back
prince
andrei
said
that
he
did
not
belong
to
his
serenitys
staff
and
was
also
a
new
arrival
the
hussar
lieutenant
colonel
turned
to
a
smartlydressed
orderly
and
the
commander
in
chiefs
orderly
said
to
him
with
that
special
contempt
with
which
a
commander
in
chiefs
orderlies
speak
to
officers
what
his
serenity
should
be
here
shortly
what
do
you
want
the
hussar
lieutenant
colonel
smiled
into
his
mustaches
at
the
orderlys
tone
got
off
his
horse
handed
it
over
to
the
courier
and
went
up
to
bolkonsky
with
a
slight
bow
bolkonsky
moved
over
on
the
bench
the
hussar
lieutenant
colonel
sat
down
beside
him
also
waiting
for
the
commander
in
chief
said
the
hussar
lieutenant
colonel
they
say
hes
accessible
to
everybody
thank
god
with
those
sausagemakers
it
was
big
trouble
not
for
nothing
did
ermolov
ask
to
be
made
a
german
now
maybe
russians
will
be
able
to
speak
too
otherwise
devil
knows
what
theyve
been
up
to
retreating
retreating
all
the
time
did
you
do
the
campaign
he
asked
i
had
the
pleasure
replied
prince
andrei
not
only
of
taking
the
retreat
but
also
of
losing
in
that
retreat
everything
that
was
dear
to
me
not
to
speak
of
my
estates
and
the
house
i
was
born
inmy
father
who
died
of
grief
im
from
the
province
of
smolensk
ahyoure
prince
bolkonsky
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
lieutenant
colonel
denisov
better
known
as
vaska
said
denisov
shaking
prince
andreis
hand
and
peering
into
his
face
with
especially
kind
attention
yes
i
heard
he
said
with
sympathy
and
after
a
brief
pause
went
on
thats
scythian
war
its
all
very
well
only
not
for
those
who
catch
it
in
the
ribs
so
youre
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
he
nodded
his
head
very
glad
prince
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
he
added
again
with
a
sad
smile
shaking
his
hand
prince
andrei
knew
denisov
from
natashas
stories
about
her
first
suitor
that
memory
now
carried
him
back
sweetly
and
painfully
to
those
aching
feelings
which
he
had
not
thought
of
for
a
long
time
now
but
which
were
still
there
in
his
soul
recently
he
had
received
so
many
other
and
such
serious
impressionsthe
abandoning
of
smolensk
his
visit
to
bald
hills
the
recent
news
of
his
fathers
deathand
had
experienced
so
many
feelings
that
these
memories
had
not
come
to
him
for
a
long
time
and
when
they
came
were
far
from
affecting
him
with
their
former
strength
and
for
denisov
that
series
of
memories
evoked
by
the
name
bolkonsky
was
a
distant
poetic
past
when
after
supper
and
natashas
singing
not
knowing
how
himself
he
had
proposed
to
a
fifteenyearold
girl
he
smiled
at
the
memory
of
that
time
and
of
his
love
for
natasha
and
went
on
at
once
to
what
now
concerned
him
passionately
and
exclusively
it
was
a
campaign
plan
he
had
thought
up
while
serving
at
outposts
during
the
retreat
he
had
presented
this
plan
to
barclay
de
tolly
and
now
intended
to
present
it
to
kutuzov
the
plan
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
french
line
of
operations
was
very
extended
and
that
instead
of
or
along
with
acting
from
the
front
blocking
the
road
for
the
french
they
ought
to
act
against
their
communications
he
began
to
explain
this
plan
to
prince
andrei
they
cant
maintain
that
whole
line
its
impossible
ill
answer
for
breaking
through
them
give
me
five
hundred
men
and
ill
break
through
them
thats
certain
the
only
system
is
the
partisan
one
denisov
stood
up
and
gesticulating
set
forth
his
plan
for
bolkonsky
in
the
middle
of
the
account
the
shouts
of
the
army
more
incoherent
more
prolonged
and
merging
with
the
music
and
songs
came
from
the
place
of
the
review
in
the
village
hoofbeats
and
shouts
could
be
heard
himself
is
coming
cried
a
cossack
who
was
standing
by
the
gate
hes
coming
bolkonsky
and
denisov
moved
towards
the
gate
by
which
a
bunch
of
soldiers
an
honor
guard
was
standing
and
saw
kutuzov
moving
down
the
street
mounted
on
a
small
bay
horse
an
enormous
suite
of
generals
rode
after
him
barclay
rode
almost
beside
him
a
crowd
of
officers
ran
after
them
and
around
them
and
shouted
hurrah
the
adjutants
rode
into
the
yard
ahead
of
him
kutuzov
impatiently
urging
on
his
horse
which
glided
at
an
amble
under
his
weight
and
constantly
nodding
his
head
kept
putting
his
hand
to
the
white
cap
of
the
horse
guards
he
was
wearing
with
a
red
band
and
no
visor
coming
up
to
the
honor
guard
of
dashing
grenadiers
most
of
them
decorated
who
were
saluting
him
he
studied
them
silently
and
attentively
for
a
minute
with
a
commanders
intent
gaze
and
turned
to
the
crowd
of
generals
and
officers
that
stood
around
him
his
face
suddenly
assumed
a
subtle
expression
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
gesture
of
perplexity
and
with
such
fine
fellows
to
keep
retreating
and
retreating
he
said
well
goodbye
general
he
added
and
sent
his
horse
through
the
gate
past
prince
andrei
and
denisov
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
cries
came
behind
him
since
prince
andrei
last
saw
him
kutuzov
had
grown
still
heavier
become
flabby
and
swollen
with
fat
but
his
familiar
white
eye
and
the
wound
and
the
weary
expression
of
his
face
and
figure
were
the
same
he
was
dressed
in
a
uniform
jacket
the
whip
hung
on
a
thin
strap
over
his
shoulder
and
the
white
horse
guards
cap
he
sat
on
his
brisk
horse
sagging
and
swaying
heavily
phewphewphew
he
whistled
barely
audibly
riding
into
the
courtyard
his
face
expressed
the
joy
of
relief
a
man
feels
who
intends
to
rest
after
an
official
appearance
he
took
his
left
foot
from
the
stirrup
and
with
difficulty
swinging
his
whole
body
and
wincing
from
the
effort
lifted
it
over
the
saddle
leaned
on
his
knee
grunted
and
lowered
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
cossacks
and
adjutants
who
supported
him
he
straightened
up
looked
around
with
his
narrowed
gaze
and
glancing
at
prince
andrei
obviously
without
recognizing
him
strode
towards
the
porch
with
his
dipping
gait
phewphewphew
he
whistled
and
again
glanced
around
at
prince
andrei
only
after
several
seconds
did
the
impression
of
prince
andreis
face
as
often
happens
with
old
men
connect
with
the
remembrance
of
his
person
ah
greetings
prince
greetings
dear
boy
come
along
he
said
wearily
looking
around
and
went
heavily
up
the
steps
which
creaked
under
his
weight
he
unbuttoned
his
jacket
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
that
stood
on
the
porch
well
hows
your
father
yesterday
i
received
news
of
his
passing
away
prince
andrei
said
shortly
kutuzov
looked
at
prince
andrei
with
wideopen
startled
eyes
then
took
off
his
cap
and
crossed
himself
god
rest
his
soul
his
will
be
done
with
us
all
he
sighed
deeply
with
his
whole
chest
and
fell
silent
i
loved
and
respected
him
and
i
sympathize
with
you
wholeheartedly
he
embraced
prince
andrei
pressed
him
to
his
fat
chest
and
did
not
let
go
of
him
for
a
long
time
when
he
did
prince
andrei
saw
that
kutuzovs
swollen
lips
were
trembling
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
sighed
and
took
hold
of
the
bench
with
both
hands
in
order
to
stand
up
come
along
come
to
my
place
well
have
a
talk
he
said
but
just
then
denisov
who
quailed
as
little
before
his
superiors
as
he
did
before
the
enemy
though
the
adjutants
by
the
porch
tried
to
stop
him
with
angry
whispers
boldly
went
up
the
steps
his
spurs
knocking
against
them
kutuzov
leaving
his
hands
propped
on
the
bench
looked
at
denisov
with
displeasure
denisov
gave
his
name
and
announced
that
he
had
to
inform
his
serenity
of
a
matter
of
great
importance
for
the
good
of
the
fatherland
kutuzov
began
to
look
at
denisov
with
his
weary
gaze
and
in
a
gesture
of
vexation
taking
his
hands
from
the
bench
and
folding
them
over
his
stomach
repeated
for
the
good
of
the
fatherland
well
what
is
it
speak
denisov
blushed
like
a
girl
how
strange
it
was
to
see
a
blush
on
that
mustached
old
and
drunken
face
and
boldly
began
to
set
forth
his
plan
for
cutting
the
enemys
line
of
operations
between
smolensk
and
the
vyazma
denisov
used
to
live
in
that
area
and
knew
the
terrain
well
his
plan
seemed
unquestionably
good
especially
from
the
power
of
conviction
in
his
words
kutuzov
was
looking
at
his
feet
and
occasionally
glanced
at
the
courtyard
of
the
neighboring
cottage
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
from
there
and
in
fact
during
the
time
that
denisov
was
speaking
a
general
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
appeared
from
the
cottage
he
was
looking
at
what
kutuzov
said
in
the
middle
of
denisovs
explanation
ready
so
soon
ready
your
serenity
said
the
general
kutuzov
shook
his
head
as
if
to
say
how
can
one
man
have
time
for
it
all
and
went
on
listening
to
denisov
i
give
you
the
noble
word
of
honor
of
a
russian
officer
denisov
was
saying
that
i
will
break
napoleons
communications
what
relation
are
you
to
kirill
andreevich
denisov
the
commissary
general
kutuzov
interrupted
him
hes
my
uncle
your
serenity
oh
we
were
friends
kutuzov
said
cheerfully
very
well
very
well
my
dear
boy
stay
here
at
headquarters
well
talk
tomorrow
nodding
to
denisov
he
turned
away
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
konovnitsyn
had
brought
him
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
come
in
your
serenity
the
general
on
duty
said
in
a
displeased
voice
it
is
necessary
to
study
the
plans
and
sign
some
papers
an
adjutant
came
out
the
door
and
announced
that
everything
was
ready
in
the
apartment
but
kutuzov
evidently
wanted
to
be
free
before
going
in
he
winced
no
my
dear
boy
have
them
bring
out
a
little
table
ill
look
at
them
here
he
said
dont
go
away
he
added
turning
to
prince
andrei
prince
andrei
stayed
on
the
porch
listening
to
the
general
on
duty
during
the
report
prince
andrei
heard
a
womans
whispers
and
the
rustle
of
a
womans
silk
dress
behind
the
front
door
several
times
glancing
in
that
direction
he
noticed
behind
the
door
a
plump
redcheeked
and
beautiful
woman
in
a
pink
dress
with
a
purple
silk
kerchief
on
her
head
holding
a
platter
and
obviously
waiting
for
the
commander
in
chief
to
come
in
kutuzovs
adjutant
explained
in
a
whisper
to
prince
andrei
that
she
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
the
priests
wife
who
intended
to
meet
his
serenity
with
bread
and
salt
her
husband
had
met
his
serenity
in
church
with
a
cross
and
she
at
homevery
pretty
the
adjutant
added
with
a
smile
at
those
words
kutuzov
glanced
up
kutuzov
listened
to
the
report
of
the
general
on
duty
the
main
subject
of
which
was
a
critique
of
the
position
at
tsarevozaimishche
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
listened
to
denisov
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
listened
seven
years
earlier
to
the
debate
at
the
austerlitz
council
of
war
he
obviously
listened
only
because
he
had
ears
which
despite
the
fact
that
one
of
them
was
stopped
up
with
hemp
could
not
help
listening
but
it
was
obvious
not
only
that
he
could
not
be
surprised
or
interested
in
anything
the
general
on
duty
could
tell
him
but
that
he
knew
beforehand
everything
he
was
being
told
and
listened
to
it
only
because
he
had
to
listen
as
one
has
to
listen
to
the
singing
of
a
prayer
service
everything
denisov
had
said
was
practical
and
intelligent
what
the
general
on
duty
was
saying
was
still
more
practical
and
intelligent
but
it
was
obvious
that
kutuzov
despised
both
knowledge
and
intelligence
and
knew
something
else
that
was
to
decide
matterssomething
that
did
not
depend
on
intelligence
and
knowledge
prince
andrei
followed
attentively
the
expression
of
the
commander
in
chiefs
face
and
the
only
expression
he
was
able
to
notice
on
it
was
one
of
boredom
of
curiosity
about
the
meaning
of
the
womans
whispering
behind
the
door
and
of
the
wish
to
observe
propriety
it
was
obvious
that
kutuzov
despised
the
intelligence
the
knowledge
and
even
the
patriotic
feeling
shown
by
denisov
but
he
despised
them
not
with
his
intelligence
or
feeling
or
knowledge
for
he
did
not
even
try
to
show
any
he
despised
them
with
something
else
he
despised
them
with
his
old
age
with
his
experience
of
life
the
one
order
kutuzov
added
personally
to
this
report
was
concerned
with
looting
by
russian
troops
at
the
end
of
his
report
the
general
on
duty
presented
his
serenity
with
a
paper
to
be
signed
concerning
remuneration
by
the
army
commanders
at
a
landowners
request
for
green
oats
that
had
been
mowed
down
kutuzov
smacked
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
having
listened
to
the
matter
into
the
stoveinto
the
fire
and
i
tell
you
once
and
for
all
my
dear
boy
he
said
into
the
fire
with
all
these
things
let
them
cut
grain
and
burn
wood
as
much
as
they
like
i
dont
order
it
or
allow
it
but
neither
can
i
punish
them
for
it
its
impossible
otherwise
when
you
chop
wood
the
chips
fly
he
glanced
at
the
paper
once
more
oh
german
scrupulosity
he
said
shaking
his
head
xvi
well
thats
all
now
said
kutuzov
signing
the
last
paper
and
getting
up
heavily
and
smoothing
the
folds
of
his
plump
white
neck
he
headed
for
the
door
with
a
more
cheerful
face
the
priests
wife
the
blood
rushing
to
her
face
seized
the
platter
which
though
she
had
had
it
so
long
prepared
she
still
did
not
manage
to
present
in
time
with
a
low
bow
she
offered
it
to
kutuzov
kutuzovs
eyes
narrowed
he
smiled
took
her
by
the
chin
and
said
and
such
a
beauty
thank
you
my
dear
girl
he
took
a
few
gold
coins
from
the
pocket
of
his
wide
trousers
and
put
them
on
the
platter
for
her
well
hows
your
life
said
kutuzov
heading
for
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
to
him
the
priests
wife
with
dimples
on
her
redcheeked
smiling
face
followed
him
into
the
room
the
adjutant
came
out
to
the
porch
and
invited
prince
andrei
to
lunch
half
an
hour
later
prince
andrei
was
again
summoned
to
kutuzov
kutuzov
was
lying
in
an
armchair
in
the
same
unbuttoned
coat
he
was
holding
a
french
book
in
his
hand
and
when
prince
andrei
came
in
he
closed
it
using
the
paper
knife
as
a
bookmark
it
was
les
chevaliers
du
cygne
by
mme
de
genlis
as
prince
andrei
saw
by
the
cover
well
sit
down
sit
down
here
lets
talk
said
kutuzov
its
sad
very
sad
but
remember
my
dear
friend
that
im
like
a
father
to
you
a
second
father
prince
andrei
told
kutuzov
all
he
knew
about
his
fathers
passing
away
and
about
what
he
had
seen
at
bald
hills
as
he
passed
through
seesee
what
theyve
brought
us
to
kutuzov
suddenly
said
with
deep
feeling
obviously
picturing
clearly
to
himself
from
prince
andreis
account
the
situation
russia
was
in
just
wait
just
wait
he
added
with
a
spiteful
expression
on
his
face
and
obviously
not
wishing
to
continue
this
disturbing
conversation
he
said
i
sent
for
you
so
as
to
keep
you
with
me
i
thank
your
serenity
replied
prince
andrei
but
im
afraid
im
no
longer
fit
for
the
staff
he
said
with
a
smile
which
kutuzov
noticed
kutuzov
looked
at
him
questioningly
and
above
all
prince
andrei
added
im
used
to
the
regiment
ive
come
to
love
the
officers
and
the
men
seem
to
love
me
id
be
sorry
to
leave
the
regiment
if
i
refuse
the
honor
of
being
attached
to
you
believe
me
an
intelligent
kind
and
at
the
same
time
subtly
mocking
expression
lit
up
on
kutuzovs
plump
face
he
interrupted
bolkonsky
im
sorry
i
would
have
had
need
of
you
but
youre
right
youre
right
its
not
here
that
we
need
men
advisers
are
always
plentiful
but
men
are
not
the
regiments
wouldnt
be
what
they
are
if
all
the
advisers
served
in
them
as
you
do
i
remember
you
from
austerlitzi
remember
i
remember
you
with
the
standard
said
kutuzov
and
a
flush
of
joy
rose
to
prince
andreis
face
at
this
recollection
kutuzov
pulled
him
to
him
by
the
arm
offering
him
his
cheek
and
again
prince
andrei
saw
tears
in
the
old
mans
eyes
though
prince
andrei
knew
that
kutuzov
wept
easily
and
that
his
special
gentleness
and
pity
for
him
now
was
caused
by
a
desire
to
show
sympathy
for
his
loss
prince
andrei
was
both
gladdened
and
flattered
by
this
recollection
of
austerlitz
go
your
way
with
god
i
know
your
way
is
the
way
of
honor
he
paused
i
was
sorry
you
werent
in
bucharest
i
needed
someone
to
send
and
changing
the
subject
kutuzov
began
speaking
about
the
turkish
war
and
the
peace
that
had
been
concluded
yes
ive
been
reproached
a
good
deal
said
kutuzov
both
for
the
war
and
for
the
peacebut
everything
came
at
the
right
time
tout
vient
224
point
224
celui
qui
sait
attendre
and
there
too
there
were
no
fewer
advisers
than
here
he
went
on
returning
to
the
advisers
who
were
clearly
on
his
mind
ah
advisers
advisers
he
said
if
wed
listened
to
everybody
there
in
turkey
we
wouldnt
have
made
peace
and
brought
the
war
to
an
end
everything
quickly
but
quick
turns
out
to
be
slow
if
kamensky
hadnt
died
hed
have
been
lost
he
stormed
fortresses
with
thirty
thousand
men
its
not
hard
to
take
a
fortress
its
hard
to
win
a
campaign
and
for
that
theres
no
need
to
storm
and
attack
theres
need
for
patience
and
time
kamensky
sent
soldiers
to
rushchuk
but
i
with
just
those
two
patience
and
time
took
more
fortresses
than
kamensky
and
made
the
turks
eat
horseflesh
he
shook
his
head
and
the
french
will
too
take
my
word
for
it
kutuzov
said
becoming
animated
and
beating
his
chest
theyll
eat
horseflesh
for
me
and
again
his
eyes
glistened
with
tears
but
wont
we
have
to
accept
battle
said
prince
andrei
well
have
to
if
everybody
wants
it
theres
no
way
around
itand
yet
my
dear
boy
theres
nothing
stronger
than
those
two
warriors
patience
and
time
theyd
do
it
all
but
the
advisers
nentendent
pas
de
cette
oreille
voil224
le
mal
some
want
it
others
dont
what
can
we
do
he
asked
evidently
expecting
an
answer
yes
what
would
you
have
us
do
he
repeated
and
his
eyes
shone
with
a
profound
intelligent
expression
ill
tell
you
what
to
do
he
went
on
since
prince
andrei
still
gave
no
answer
ill
tell
you
what
to
do
and
what
i
do
dans
le
doute
mon
cher
he
paused
abstienstoi
he
pronounced
measuredly
well
goodbye
my
dear
friend
remember
that
i
bear
your
loss
with
all
my
heart
and
that
for
you
im
not
a
serenity
or
a
prince
or
a
commander
in
chief
but
a
father
if
you
need
anything
come
straight
to
me
goodbye
my
dear
boy
again
he
embraced
him
and
kissed
him
and
before
prince
andrei
had
time
to
get
through
the
door
kutuzov
sighed
and
again
picked
up
the
unfinished
novel
by
mme
de
genlis
les
chevaliers
du
cygne
how
and
why
it
happened
prince
andrei
could
in
no
way
have
explained
but
after
this
meeting
with
kutuzov
he
went
back
to
his
regiment
relieved
with
regard
to
the
general
course
of
things
and
with
regard
to
the
man
to
whom
it
had
been
entrusted
the
more
he
saw
the
absence
of
anything
personal
in
this
old
man
in
whom
there
seemed
to
remain
only
the
habit
of
passions
and
instead
of
intelligence
which
groups
events
and
draws
conclusions
only
the
ability
to
calmly
contemplate
the
course
of
events
the
more
calmed
he
felt
over
everything
being
as
it
had
to
be
he
wont
have
anything
of
his
own
he
wont
invent
wont
undertake
anything
thought
prince
andrei
but
hell
listen
to
everything
remember
everything
put
everything
in
its
place
wont
hinder
anything
useful
or
allow
anything
harmful
he
understands
that
there
is
something
stronger
and
more
significant
than
his
willthe
inevitable
course
of
eventsand
hes
able
to
see
them
able
to
understand
their
significance
and
in
view
of
that
significance
is
able
to
renounce
participating
in
those
events
renounce
his
personal
will
and
direct
it
elsewhere
and
the
main
reason
why
one
believes
him
thought
prince
andrei
is
that
hes
russian
despite
the
genlis
novel
and
the
french
proverbs
its
that
his
voice
trembled
when
he
said
see
what
theyve
brought
us
to
and
had
a
catch
in
it
when
he
said
hed
make
them
eat
horseflesh
on
this
feeling
which
was
more
or
less
vaguely
experienced
by
everyone
the
unanimity
and
general
approval
were
based
which
contrary
to
the
considerations
of
the
court
accompanied
the
peoples
election
of
kutuzov
as
commander
in
chief
xvii
after
the
sovereigns
departure
from
moscow
moscow
life
flowed
on
in
its
former
habitual
way
and
the
course
of
that
life
was
so
habitual
that
it
was
hard
to
remember
the
recent
days
of
patriotic
rapture
and
enthusiasm
and
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
russia
was
actually
in
danger
and
that
the
members
of
the
english
club
were
at
the
same
time
sons
of
the
fatherland
ready
for
any
sacrifice
for
its
sake
the
one
thing
that
recalled
the
general
rapturously
patriotic
mood
during
the
sovereigns
stay
in
moscow
was
the
call
for
contributions
in
men
and
money
which
as
soon
as
it
was
made
acquired
a
legal
official
form
and
seemed
inevitable
with
the
enemys
approach
to
moscow
the
muscovites
view
of
their
situation
not
only
did
not
become
more
serious
but
on
the
contrary
became
still
more
lightminded
as
always
happens
with
people
who
see
great
danger
approaching
at
the
approach
of
danger
two
voices
always
speak
with
equal
force
in
a
mans
soul
one
quite
reasonably
tells
the
man
to
consider
the
properties
of
the
danger
and
the
means
of
saving
himself
from
it
the
other
says
still
more
reasonably
that
it
is
too
painful
and
tormenting
to
think
about
the
danger
when
it
is
not
in
mans
power
to
foresee
everything
and
save
himself
from
the
general
course
of
things
and
therefore
it
is
better
to
turn
away
from
the
painful
things
until
they
come
and
think
about
what
is
pleasant
in
solitude
a
man
most
often
yields
to
the
first
voice
in
company
on
the
contrary
to
the
second
that
is
what
now
happened
with
the
citizens
of
moscow
it
was
long
since
there
had
been
so
much
merrymaking
in
moscow
as
there
was
that
year
rastopchins
little
posters
with
a
picture
at
the
top
of
a
drinking
house
a
tapster
and
the
moscow
tradesman
karpushka
chigirin
who
being
a
militiaman
and
having
taken
a
drop
too
much
from
the
tap
heard
that
bonaparte
wanted
to
march
on
moscow
became
angry
denounced
all
the
french
in
nasty
terms
came
out
of
the
drinking
house
and
under
the
eagle
began
speaking
to
the
assembled
people
were
read
and
discussed
on
a
par
with
the
latest
boutsrim233s
of
vassily
lvovich
pushkin
people
gathered
in
the
corner
room
of
the
club
to
read
these
posters
and
some
liked
the
way
karpushka
taunted
the
french
saying
that
they
will
get
bloated
with
cabbage
burst
with
kasha
choke
on
shchi
that
theyre
all
dwarfs
and
that
one
peasant
woman
will
toss
three
of
them
with
a
pitchfork
some
disapproved
of
this
tone
and
said
it
was
banal
and
stupid
it
was
said
that
rastopchin
had
banished
all
frenchmen
and
even
all
foreigners
from
moscow
that
there
were
spies
and
agents
of
napoleon
among
them
but
this
was
said
primarily
in
order
to
have
an
occasion
to
repeat
the
witticism
rastopchin
had
produced
as
they
were
being
sent
away
the
foreigners
were
sent
by
barge
to
nizhny
and
rastopchin
said
to
them
rentrez
en
vousm234me
entrez
dans
la
barque
et
nen
faites
pas
une
barque
de
charon
it
was
said
that
all
the
government
offices
had
already
been
sent
away
from
moscow
and
at
once
shinshins
joke
was
added
that
for
that
alone
people
should
be
grateful
to
napoleon
the
story
went
that
mamonovs
regiment
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
thousand
that
bezukhov
had
spent
still
more
on
his
militia
but
that
the
best
thing
about
bezukhovs
actions
was
that
he
was
going
to
put
on
a
uniform
himself
and
ride
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
and
charge
no
admission
for
those
who
wanted
to
look
at
him
you
make
no
grace
to
anyone
said
julie
drubetskoy
gathering
and
pressing
together
a
little
pile
of
shredded
lint
with
her
slender
beringed
fingers
julie
was
preparing
to
leave
moscow
the
next
day
and
was
giving
a
farewell

bezukhov
est
ridicule
but
hes
so
kind
so
sweet
whats
the
pleasure
to
be
so
caustique
a
fine
said
a
young
man
in
a
militia
uniform
whom
julie
called
mon
chevalier
and
who
was
going
to
nizhny
with
her
in
julies
circle
as
in
many
other
circles
in
moscow
it
had
been
decided
to
speak
only
russian
and
those
who
mistakenly
spoke
a
french
word
had
to
pay
a
fine
for
the
benefit
of
the
donation
committee
another
fine
for
the
gallicism
said
a
russian
writer
who
was
in
the
drawing
room
one
doesnt
say
the
pleasure
to
be
you
make
no
grace
to
anyone
julie
went
on
to
the
militiaman
ignoring
the
writers
comment
i
plead
guilty
to
the
caustique
she
said
and
will
pay
and
im
prepared
to
pay
more
for
the
pleasure
to
tell
you
the
truth
but
i
cant
answer
for
the
gallicisms
she
turned
to
the
writer
i
have
neither
the
money
nor
the
time
as
prince
golitsyn
does
to
take
a
tutor
and
study
russian
ah
here
he
is
said
julie
quand
on
no
no
she
turned
to
the
militiaman
you
wont
catch
me
when
one
speaks
of
the
sun
one
sees
its
rays
said
the
hostess
smiling
amiably
at
pierre
we
were
just
talking
about
you
said
julie
with
a
society
womans
aptitude
for
lying
freely
we
were
saying
that
your
regiment
would
probably
be
better
than
mamonovs
ah
dont
speak
to
me
about
my
regiment
replied
pierre
kissing
the
hostesss
hand
and
sitting
down
beside
her
im
so
sick
of
it
but
surely
youre
going
to
command
it
yourself
said
julie
exchanging
a
sly
and
mocking
glance
with
the
militiaman
in
pierres
presence
the
militiaman
was
no
longer
so
caustique
and
his
face
showed
perplexity
over
the
meaning
of
julies
smile
despite
his
absentmindedness
and
good
nature
the
person
of
pierre
immediately
put
a
stop
to
all
attempts
at
mockery
in
his
presence
no
replied
pierre
laughing
and
looking
over
his
big
fat
body
id
be
much
too
easy
a
target
for
the
french
and
im
afraid
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
get
on
a
horse
among
the
persons
touched
upon
in
conversation
in
julies
circle
there
happened
to
be
the
rostovs
people
say
things

very
bad

their
house
and
the

near
moscow
and

one
of
these
days
someone

though

the
militiaman
went
on
about
rostov
a
kind
old
man
but
a
very
pauvre
sire
and
why
have
they
stayed
so
long
theyve
been
wanting

the
country
for
a
long
time
natalie

to
be
well

julie
asked
pierre
with
a
sly
smile

their
younger
son
said
pierre
he
joined
obolenskys
cossacks
and
went
to
belaya
tserkov
the
regiments

formed
there
but
now
theyve
transferred
him
to
my
regiment
and
are
expecting

the
count

a
long
time
but
the
countess
wont

to
leave
moscow
for
anything
until
their
son

i
saw
them
two
days
ago
at
the
arkharovs
natalie
has
grown
pretty
and
cheerful
again
she
sang
a
romance
how
easily
some
people
get
over
things
get
over
what
pierre
asked
with
displeasure
julie
smiled
you
know
count
knights
like
you
are
found
only
in
the
novels
of
mme
de

what

the
militiaman
well

pierre
asked
angrily

up
enough
count

pierre

that

pierre
went
on
in
a
displeased
tone
i
did
not
take
upon
myself
the
role
of
miss
rostovs
knight
at
all
and
i
havent
been
there
for
almost
a
month
but
i
do
not
understand
the
cruelty
qui

julie
said
smiling
and
waving
the
lint
and
to
have
the
last
word
remain
hers
she
changed
the
subject
immediately
imagine
ive
just
learned
that
poor
marie
bolkonsky
arrived
in
moscow
yesterday
have
you
heard
she
lost
her
father
is
it
true
where
is
she
id
very
much
like
to
see
her
said
pierre
i
spent
the
evening
with
her
yesterday
today
or
tomorrow
morning
shes
going
to
her
estate
near
moscow
with
her
nephew
well
how

she
asked
pierre
all
right
but
sad
but
do
you
know
who
saved
her
its
a
whole
romance
nicolas
rostov
they
surrounded
her
wanted
to
kill
her
wounded
her
people
he
rushed
in
and
saved
her
another
romance
said
the
militiaman
decidedly
this
general
flight
has
been
done
so
as
to
get
all
the
old
maids
married
catiche
is
one
princess
bolkonsky
another
you
know
i
think
in
fact
that
she
is
un
petit
peu
amoureuse
du
jeune
homme
a
fine
a
fine
a
fine
but
how
do
you
say
it
in
russian
xviii
when
pierre
returned
home
he
was
given
two
of
rastopchins
posters
that
had
been
brought
that
day
the
first
said
that
the
rumor
about
count
rastopchin
forbidding
people
to
leave
moscow
was
false
and
that
on
the
contrary
count
rastopchin
was
glad
that
ladies
and
merchants
wives
were
leaving
there
will
be
less
fear
less
gossip
said
the
poster
but
i
answer
with
my
life
that
the
villain
will
never
be
in
moscow
these
words
showed
pierre
clearly
for
the
first
time
that
the
french
would
be
in
moscow
the
second
poster
said
that
our
headquarters
were
in
vyazma
that
count
wittgenstein
had
beaten
the
french
but
since
many
of
the
inhabitants
wished
to
be
armed
there
were
weapons
prepared
for
them
in
the
arsenalsabers
pistols
musketswhich
the
inhabitants
could
obtain
at
a
low
price
the
tone
of
the
posters
was
no
longer
as
jocular
as
in
chigirins
former
bantering
pierre
fell
to
pondering
over
these
posters
obviously
that
dreadful
storm
cloud
he
had
been
calling
up
with
all
the
powers
of
his
soul
and
which
at
the
same
time
aroused
an
involuntary
terror
in
himobviously
that
storm
cloud
was
approaching
go
into
military
service
and
leave
for
the
army
or
sit
and
wait
pierre
asked
himself
this
question
for
the
hundredth
time
he
took
a
deck
of
cards
that
lay
on
his
table
and
began
to
play
patience
if
this
patience
comes
out
he
said
to
himself
shuffling
the
deck
holding
it
in
his
hand
and
looking
up
if
it
comes
out
that
meanswhat
does
it
mean
before
he
decided
what
it
meant
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
eldest
princess
behind
the
door
asking
if
she
could
come
in
then
it
will
mean
i
must
go
to
the
army
pierre
finished
to
himself
come
in
come
in
he
added
addressing
the
princess
only
the
eldest
princess
with
the
long
waist
and
stony
face
was
still
living
in
pierres
house
the
two
younger
ones
had
married
excuse
me
mon
cousin
for
coming
to
you
she
said
in
a
reproachfully
agitated
voice
something
must
finally
be
decided
on
what
is
going
to
happen
everyone
has
left
moscow
and
the
people
are
rebellious
why
are
we
staying
on
the
contrary
everything
seems
quite
well
ma
cousine
said
pierre
with
that
habitual
jocularity
which
he
always
embarrassed
by
his
role
as
the
princesss
benefactor
adopted
in
his
relations
with
her
yes
quite
wellwell
indeed
varvara
ivanovna
told
me
today
how
our
troops
have
distinguished
themselves
it
can
be
set
down
to
their
honor
and
the
people
are
quite
rebellious
theyve
stopped
listening
even
my
maid
has
become
rude
soon
theyll
start
beating
us
its
impossible
to
walk
in
the
street
and
above
all
the
french
will
be
here
any
daywhat
are
we
waiting
for
one
thing
i
ask
mon
cousin
said
the
princess
order
them
to
take
me
to
petersburg
however
i
may
be
i
cannot
live
under
bonapartes
rule
enough
now
ma
cousine
where
do
you
get
your
information
on
the
contrary
i
will
not
submit
to
your
napoleon
others
can
do
as
they
likeif
you
dont
want
to
do
this
ill
do
it
ill
give
the
order
at
once
the
princess
was
clearly
annoyed
that
there
was
no
one
to
be
angry
with
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
whispering
something
but
youve
been
incorrectly
informed
said
pierre
the
citys
all
quiet
and
there
isnt
any
danger
see
what
ive
just
read
pierre
showed
the
little
posters
to
the
princess
the
count
writes
that
he
answers
with
his
life
that
the
enemy
will
not
be
in
moscow
ah
this
count
of
yours
the
princess
began
with
anger
is
a
hypocrite
a
villain
who
set
the
people
to
rebelling
himself
didnt
he
write
in
these
foolish
posters
that
whoever
it
might
be
just
take
him
by
the
topknot
and
drag
him
to
the
precinct
how
stupid
anybody
who
gets
one
they
say
honor
and
glory
to
him
so
much
for
his
pretty
words
varvara
ivanovna
says
the
people
nearly
killed
her
for
speaking
french
but
thats
justyou
take
it
all
too
much
to
heart
said
pierre
and
he
began
laying
out
patience
though
the
patience
came
out
pierre
did
not
go
to
the
army
but
remained
in
deserted
moscow
still
in
the
same
anxiety
irresolution
in
the
fear
and
at
the
same
time
the
joy
of
awaiting
something
terrible
the
princess
left
towards
evening
the
next
day
and
pierres
head
steward
arrived
with
news
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
hold
of
the
money
needed
to
equip
a
regiment
unless
one
of
the
estates
was
sold
in
general
the
head
steward
made
it
seem
to
pierre
that
this
whole
undertaking
with
the
regiment
would
ruin
him
pierre
had
a
hard
time
concealing
a
smile
as
he
listened
to
the
stewards
words
well
sell
one
he
said
whats
to
be
done
i
cant
back
out
of
it
now
the
worse
the
state
of
any
affairs
and
especially
his
own
the
more
pleasant
it
was
for
pierre
the
more
obvious
it
was
that
the
catastrophe
he
expected
was
approaching
by
then
pierre
had
almost
no
acquaintances
left
in
the
city
julie
was
gone
princess
marya
was
gone
of
close
acquaintances
only
the
rostovs
remained
but
pierre
did
not
call
on
them
that
day
to
distract
himself
pierre
went
to
the
village
of
vorontsovo
to
look
at
the
big
hotair
balloon
that
was
being
constructed
by
leppich
to
destroy
the
enemy
and
the
testing
of
the
balloon
which
was
to
go
up
the
next
day
the
balloon
was
not
ready
yet
but
as
pierre
learned
it
was
being
constructed
at
the
wish
of
the
sovereign
about
this
balloon
the
sovereign
wrote
the
following

returning
home
from
vorontsovo
and
driving
through
bolotnaya
square
pierre
saw
a
crowd
at
the
execution
ground
stopped
and
got
out
of
the
droshky
it
was
the
flogging
of
a
french
cook
accused
of
spying
the
flogging
had
just
ended
and
the
executioner
was
releasing
from
the
flogginghorse
a
fat
man
with
red
sidewhiskers
in
blue
stockings
and
a
green
jacket
who
was
moaning
pitifully
another
criminal
thin
and
pale
was
standing
nearby
both
judging
by
their
faces
were
frenchmen
with
a
morbidly
frightened
air
similar
to
that
on
the
thin
frenchmans
face
pierre
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
what
is
this
who
for
what
he
asked
but
the
attention
of
the
crowdoffice
clerks

muzhiks
women
in
coats
and
jacketswas
so
eagerly
concentrated
on
what
was
happening
on
the

ground
that
nobody
answered
him
the
fat
man
got
up
frowning
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
evidently
wishing
to
show
firmness
began
putting
on
his
camisole
without
looking
around
him
but
his
lips
suddenly
trembled
and
he
began
to
cry
angry
with
himself
as
sanguine
grownup
people
cry
the
crowd
began
talking
loudlyto
stifle
their
feeling
of
pity
as
it
seemed

said
a

who
was

next
to

when
the

began
to

the

looked
around
evidently
expecting

to
be

some
laughed
some
went
on

fearfully
at
the

who
was

the

pierre
snuffed
his
nose
winced
and
turning
around
quickly
went
back
to
the
droshky
muttering
to
himself
all
the
while
as
he
walked
and
got
in
during
the
ride
he
gave
a
start
several
times
and
cried
out
so
loudly
that
the
coachman
asked
him
what
orders
where
are
you
going
pierre
cried
out
to
the
coachman
who
was
driving
out
to
the
lubyanka
to
the
commander
in
chiefs
as
you
ordered
replied
the
coachman
fool

cried
pierre
yelling
at
his
coachman
which
rarely
happened

him
home
i
told
you
and
drive

i
must
leave
today
pierre
said
to
himself
at
the
sight
of
the
punished
frenchman
and
the
crowd
surrounding
the
execution
ground
pierre
had
decided
so
definitively
that
he
could
no
longer
remain
in
moscow
and
would
go
to
the
army
the
same
day
that
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
either
told
the
coachman
about
it
or
the
coachman
should
have
known
it
himself
on
returning
home
pierre
told
his
allknowing
allcapable
coachman
evstafyich
familiar
to
the
whole
of
moscow
that
he
would
go
to
the
army
in
mozhaisk
that
night
and
ordered
his
riding
horses
sent
there
to
do
everything
on
the
same
day
was
impossible
and
therefore
to
evstafyichs
mind
pierre
should
postpone
his
departure
until
the
next
day
to
leave
time
for
the
relay
horses
to
get
ahead
of
him
on
the
twentyfourth
it
cleared
up
after
some
bad
weather
and
that
day
after
dinner
pierre
left
moscow
during
the
night
while
changing
horses
at
perkhushkovo
pierre
learned
that
there
had
been
a
major
battle
that
evening
it
was
said
that
there
in
perkhushkovo
the
ground
shook
from
the
cannon
fire
to
pierres
question
of
who
had
won
no
one
could
give
an
answer
this
was
the
battle
of
the
twentyfourth
at
shevardino
at
dawn
pierre
was
riding
up
to
mozhaisk
all
the
houses
in
mozhaisk
were
occupied
by
stationed
troops
and
at
the
inn
where
pierre
was
met
by
his
groom
and
coachman
there
were
no
places
in
the
rooms
it
was
all
filled
with
officers
everywhere
in
mozhaisk
and
beyond
mozhaisk
troops
were
camped
or
marching
cossacks
foot
soldiers
horse
soldiers
wagons
caissons
cannon
could
be
seen
on
all
sides
pierre
was
in
a
hurry
to
move
on
quickly
and
the
further
he
went
from
moscow
and
the
deeper
he
immersed
himself
in
that
sea
of
troops
the
more
he
was
overcome
by
anxious
restlessness
and
a
new
joyful
feeling
he
had
never
experienced
before
this
was
a
feeling
similar
to
what
he
had
experienced
at
the
slobodsky
palace
at
the
time
of
the
sovereigns
arrivala
feeling
of
the
need
to
undertake
something
and
sacrifice
something
he
now
experienced
a
pleasant
sense
of
awareness
that
everything
that
constitutes
peoples
happiness
the
comforts
of
life
wealth
even
life
itself
is
nonsense
which
it
is
pleasant
to
throw
away
in
comparison
with
somethingwith
what
pierre
could
not
account
for
to
himself
nor
did
he
try
to
clarify
to
himself
for
whom
and
for
what
he
found
it
so
particularly
delightful
to
sacrifice
everything
he
was
not
concerned
with
what
he
wanted
to
sacrifice
it
for
but
the
sacrificing
itself
constituted
a
new
joyful
feeling
for
him
xix
on
the
twentyfourth
there
was
the
battle
at
the
shevardino
redoubt
on
the
twentyfifth
not
a
single
shot
was
fired
on
either
side
on
the
twentysixth
came
the
battle
of
borodino
why
and
how
was
battle
offered
and
accepted
at
shevardino
and
borodino
why
was
the
battle
of
borodino
fought
neither
for
the
french
nor
for
the
russians
did
it
make
the
slightest
sense
the
most
immediate
result
of
it
was
and
had
to
befor
the
russians
that
we
came
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
moscow
which
we
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
world
and
for
the
french
that
they
came
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
their
whole
army
which
they
also
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
world
this
result
was
perfectly
obvious
then
and
yet
napoleon
offered
and
kutuzov
accepted
this
battle
if
the
commanders
had
been
guided
by
reasonable
causes
it
would
seem
it
should
have
been
quite
clear
to
napoleon
that
having
gone
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
accepting
battle
with
the
likely
chance
of
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
he
was
marching
to
certain
destruction
and
it
should
have
been
as
clear
to
kutuzov
that
in
accepting
battle
and
also
risking
the
loss
of
a
quarter
of
his
army
he
would
certainly
lose
moscow
for
kutuzov
this
was
mathematically
clear
as
it
is
clear
that
in
a
game
of
checkers
if
i
have
one
man
less
and
keep
trading
man
for
man
i
will
certainly
lose
and
therefore
i
should
not
keep
trading
when
my
opponent
has
sixteen
pieces
and
i
have
fourteen
i
am
only
oneeighth
weaker
than
he
but
when
i
have
traded
thirteen
pieces
he
will
be
three
times
stronger
than
i
before
the
battle
of
borodino
our
forces
were
approximately
five
to
six
with
the
french
but
after
the
battle
they
were
one
to
two
that
is
before
the
battle
it
was
a
hundred
thousand
to
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
but
after
the
battle
it
was
fifty
thousand
to
a
hundred
thousand
and
yet
the
intelligent
and
experienced
kutuzov
accepted
battle
and
napoleon
a
commander
of
genius
as
they
call
him
offered
battle
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
and
extending
his
line
still
more
if
it
is
said
that
by
occupying
moscow
he
thought
to
end
the
campaign
as
he
had
by
occupying
vienna
there
are
many
arguments
against
it
napoleons
historians
themselves
say
that
he
already
wanted
to
stop
after
smolensk
that
he
knew
the
danger
of
his
extended
position
and
knew
that
the
occupation
of
moscow
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
campaign
because
after
smolensk
he
had
seen
the
condition
of
the
russian
towns
abandoned
to
him
and
he
had
not
received
a
single
response
to
his
repeated
announcements
of
his
wish
to
negotiate
in
offering
and
accepting
battle
at
borodino
kutuzov
and
napoleon
acted
involuntarily
and
senselessly
and
only
later
did
historians
furnish
the
already
accomplished
facts
with
ingenious
arguments
for
the
foresight
and
genius
of
the
commanders
who
of
all
the
involuntary
instruments
of
world
events
were
the
most
enslaved
and
involuntary
agents
the
ancients
left
us
examples
of
heroic
poems
in
which
heroes
constitute
the
entire
interest
of
history
and
we
still
cannot
get
used
to
the
fact
that
for
our
human
time
history
of
this
sort
has
no
meaning
to
the
other
question
how
the
battle
of
borodino
and
the
one
that
preceded
it
at
shevardino
were
offered
there
exists
in
the
same
way
a
quite
definite
and
universally
known
but
completely
false
notion
all
historians
describe
the
matter
in
the
following
way
the
russian
army
in
its
retreat
from
smolensk
was
supposedly
seeking
the
best
position
for
a
general
battle
and
such
a
position
was
supposedly
found
at
borodino
the
russians
supposedly
fortified
this
position
beforehand
to
the
left
of
the
road
from
moscow
to
smolensk
almost
at
a
right
angle
to
it
from
borodino
to
utitsa
on
the
very
place
where
the
battle
was
fought
in
front
of
this
position
a
fortified
outpost
was
set
up
on
the
shevardino
barrowsupposedly
to
observe
the
enemy
on
the
twentyfourth
napoleon
supposedly
attacked
the
outpost
and
took
it
and
on
the
twentysixth
he
attacked
the
whole
russian
army
which
stood
in
position
on
the
field
of
borodino
so
the
histories
say
and
it
is
all
completely
incorrect
as
anyone
who
wishes
to
get
to
the
essence
of
the
matter
can
easily
satisfy
himself
the
russians
were
not
seeking
the
best
position
on
the
contrary
during
their
retreat
they
passed
many
positions
that
were
better
than
borodino
they
did
not
stop
at
any
of
those
positions
because
kutuzov
did
not
want
to
accept
a
position
that
he
had
not
chosen
and
because
the
peoples
call
for
battle
had
not
yet
expressed
itself
strongly
enough
and
because
miloradovich
had
not
yet
arrived
with
the
militia
and
for
countless
other
reasons
the
fact
is
that
the
former
positions
were
stronger
and
the
position
at
borodino
the
one
on
which
the
battle
was
fought
not
only
was
not
strong
but
could
no
more
be
considered
a
position
than
any
other
place
in
the
russian
empire
on
which
by
guesswork
one
might
randomly
stick
a
pin
in
a
map
the
russians
not
only
did
not
fortify
the
position
on
the
field
of
borodino
to
the
left
at
a
right
angle
to
the
road
that
is
the
place
where
the
battle
was
fought
but
never
thought
until
the
twentyfifth
of
august
1812
that
the
battle
could
be
fought
in
that
place
this
is
proved
first
by
the
fact
that
there
not
only
were
no
fortifications
in
that
place
on
the
twentyfifth
but
that
having
been
begun
on
the
twentyfifth
they
were
not
finished
on
the
twentysixth
second
it
is
proved
by
the
position
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
the
shevardino
redoubt
in
front
of
the
position
on
which
battle
was
accepted
made
no
sense
at
all
why
was
this
redoubt
fortified
more
than
any
other
point
and
why
in
defending
it
until
late
at
night
on
the
twentyfourth
were
all
efforts
exhausted
and
six
thousand
men
lost
a
mounted
cossack
patrol
would
have
sufficed
to
observe
the
enemy
the
third
proof
that
the
position
on
which
the
battle
took
place
had
not
been
foreseen
and
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
not
an
outpost
of
that
position
is
that
until
the
twentyfifth
barclay
de
tolly
and
bagration
were
convinced
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
the
position
and
that
kutuzov
himself
in
his
report
written
hot
on
the
heels
of
the
battle
called
shevardino
the
left
flank
of
the
position
much
later
when
there
was
more
leisure
for
writing
reports
about
the
battle
of
borodino
the
incorrect
and
strange
testimony
was
invented
probably
to
justify
the
mistakes
of
the
commander
in
chief
who
must
be
infallible
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
supposedly
an
outpost
whereas
it
was
only
a
fortified
point
on
the
left
flank
and
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
accepted
by
us
at
a
fortified
and
previously
chosen
position
whereas
it
occurred
in
a
completely
unexpected
and
almost
unfortified
place
this
is
evidently
how
it
was
a
position
was
chosen
along
the
river
kolocha
which
crossed
the
high
road
not
at
a
right
angle
but
at
an
acute
angle
so
that
the
left
flank
was
in
shevardino
the
right
near
the
village
of
novoe
and
the
center
in
borodino
by
the
confluence
of
the
rivers
kolocha
and
voyna
for
an
army
that
aims
at
stopping
the
enemy
from
moving
down
the
smolensk
road
towards
moscow
this
position
under
cover
of
the
river
kolocha
is
obvious
to
anyone
who
looks
over
the
field
of
borodino
forgetting
how
the
battle
took
place
napoleon
having
ridden
to
valuevo
on
the
twentyfourth
did
not
see
as
the
history
books
say
the
position
of
the
russians
from
utitsa
to
borodino
he
could
not
have
seen
that
position
because
it
did
not
exist
and
did
not
see
the
outpost
of
the
russian
army
but
ran
into
the
shevardino
redoubt
as
he
pursued
the
russian
rear
guard
and
unexpectedly
for
the
russians
had
his
troops
cross
the
kolocha
and
the
russians
even
before
the
general
battle
withdrew
their
left
wing
from
the
position
they
had
intended
to
occupy
and
took
up
a
new
position
that
had
not
been
foreseen
or
fortified
by
crossing
to
the
left
side
of
the
kolocha
to
the
left
of
the
road
napoleon
shifted
the
whole
future
battle
from
right
to
left
viewed
from
the
russian
side
and
transferred
it
to
the
field
between
utitsa
semyonovskoe
and
borodino
a
field
no
more
advantageous
as
a
position
than
any
other
field
in
russia
and
the
whole
battle
of
the
twentysixth
took
place
on
that
field
in
crude
form
the
plan
of
the
supposed
battle
and
actual
battle
is
as
in
the
map
opposite
if
napoleon
had
not
ridden
out
to
the
kolocha
on
the
evening
of
the
twentyfourth
and
had
not
ordered
an
attack
on
the
redoubt
that
same
evening
but
had
begun
the
attack
the
next
morning
no
one
would
have
questioned
that
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
our
position
and
the
battle
would
have
taken
place
as
we
had
expected
in
that
case
we
would
probably
have
defended
the
shevardino
redoubt
on
our
left
flank
still
more
tenaciously
we
would
have
attacked
napoleon
in
the
center
or
on
the
right
and
the
general
battle
would
have
taken
place
on
the
twentyfourth
at
a
position
that
had
been
fortified
and
foreseen
but
since
the
attack
on
our
left
flank
took
place
in
the
evening
following
the
retreat
of
our
rear
guard
that
is
immediately
after
the
battle
at
gridnevo
and
since
the
russian
commanders
did
not
want
or
did
not
manage
to
begin
the
general
battle
that
same
evening
of
the
twentyfourth
the
first
and
main
action
of
the
battle
of
borodino
was
already
lost
on
the
twentyfourth
and
obviously
led
to
the
loss
of
the
one
fought
on
the
twentysixth
after
the
loss
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
we
found
ourselves
on
the
morning
of
the
twentyfifth
with
no
position
on
the
left
flank
and
were
forced
into
the
necessity
of
pulling
our
left
wing
back
and
hastily
fortifying
it
wherever
it
ended
up
but
it
was
not
just
that
the
russian
troops
on
the
twentysixth
of
august
were
defended
by
weak
unfinished
fortificationsthe
disadvantage
of
this
position
was
increased
still
more
by
the
fact
that
the
russian
commanders
not
having
fully
grasped
the
accomplished
fact
the
loss
of
the
position
on
the
left
flank
and
the
transfer
of
the
whole
future
battlefield
from
right
to
left
remained
in
their
extended
position
from
the
village
of
novoe
to
utitsa
and
as
a
result
had
to
move
their
troops
from
right
to
left
during
the
battle
thus
throughout
the
battle
the
russians
confronted
the
whole
french
army
directed
against
our
left
wing
with
forces
that
were
twice
weaker
the
actions
of
poniatowski
against
utitsa
and
of
uvarov
against
the
french
on
the
right
flank
were
separate
from
the
main
course
of
the
battles
action
and
so
the
battle
of
borodino
took
place
not
at
all
as
it
is
described
in
an
attempt
to
conceal
the
mistakes
of
our
commanders
and
thereby
diminishing
the
glory
of
the
russian
army
and
people
the
battle
of
borodino
did
not
take
place
on
a
chosen
and
fortified
position
with
only
slightly
weaker
forces
on
the
russian
side
but
owing
to
the
loss
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
was
accepted
by
the
russians
on
open
almost
unfortified
terrain
with
forces
twice
weaker
than
the
frenchthat
is
in
conditions
in
which
it
was
not
only
unthinkable
to
fight
for
ten
hours
and
leave
the
battle
undecided
but
unthinkable
to
keep
the
army
for
as
long
as
three
hours
from
total
destruction
and
flight
xx
on
the
morning
of
the
twentyfifth
pierre
was
driving
out
of
mozhaisk
going
down
the
huge
steep
and
crooked
hill
that
led
out
of
the
town
past
the
cathedral
that
stood
on
the
hill
to
the
right
in
which
a
service
was
going
on
and
the
bells
were
ringing
pierre
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
went
on
foot
behind
him
some
mounted
regiment
was
coming
down
the
hill
with
singers
at
its
head
in
the
opposite
direction
came
a
train
of
carts
with
men
wounded
in
yesterdays
action
the
peasant
drivers
shouting
at
the
horses
and
whipping
them
with
knouts
kept
running
from
one
side
to
the
other
the
carts
with
three
or
four
wounded
men
lying
or
sitting
in
them
bounced
up
and
down
on
the
stones
scattered
over
the
steep
ascent
in
the
guise
of
pavement
the
wounded
men
bandaged
with
rags
pale
with
compressed
lips
and
frowning
brows
clinging
to
the
sides
bounced
and
jostled
in
the
carts
they
all
looked
at
pierres
white
hat
and
green
tailcoat
with
an
almost
na239ve
childlike
curiosity
pierres
coachman
shouted
angrily
at
the
train
of
wounded
that
they
should
keep
to
one
side
the
cavalry
regiment
coming
down
the
hill
with
songs
ran
into
pierres
droshky
and
blocked
the
road
pierre
stopped
pressing
himself
to
the
edge
of
the
road
which
was
dug
out
of
the
hillside
because
of
the
slope
of
the
hill
the
sun
did
not
reach
the
dugout
road
and
it
was
cold
and
damp
over
pierres
head
was
the
bright
august
morning
and
the
bells
rang
out
merrily
one
cart
with
wounded
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
road
just
next
to
pierre
the
driver
in
bast
shoes
ran
breathlessly
to
the
cart
stuck
a
stone
under
the
tireless
rear
wheels
and
began
to
straighten
the
breeching
on
his
stopped
little
horse
one
wounded
old
soldier
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
who
had
been
walking
behind
the
cart
took
hold
of
it
with
his
good
hand
and
glanced
at
pierre
well
countryman
are
they
setting
us
down
here
or
taking
us
to
moscow
he
said
pierre
was
so
deep
in
thought
that
he
did
not
hear
the
question
he
looked
first
at
the
cavalry
regiment
that
had
now
run
into
the
train
of
the
wounded
then
at
the
cart
he
was
standing
near
and
on
which
two
wounded
men
were
sitting
and
one
was
lying
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
in
them
lay
the
solution
to
the
problem
that
preoccupied
him
one
of
the
soldiers
sitting
on
the
cart
had
probably
been
wounded
in
the
cheek
his
whole
head
was
bound
in
rags
and
one
cheek
was
swollen
as
big
as
a
babys
head
his
mouth
and
nose
were
askew
this
soldier
was
looking
at
the
cathedral
and
crossing
himself
the
second
a
young
boy
a
recruit
fairhaired
and
as
white
as
though
there
was
no
blood
at
all
in
his
delicate
face
looked
at
pierre
with
a
fixed
kindly
smile
the
third
lay
prone
and
his
face
could
not
be
seen
the
cavalry
singers
were
just
passing
by
the
cart
ah
lost
and
gonethis
bristly
head
now
living
in
some
foreign
land
they
poured
out
a
soldiers
dance
song
as
if
seconding
them
but
with
another
sort
of
merriment
the
metallic
ringing
of
the
bells
throbbed
on
high
and
with
yet
another
sort
of
merriment
the
suns
hot
rays
bathed
the
top
of
the
slope
opposite
but
under
the
slope
by
the
cart
with
the
wounded
men
near
the
panting
little
horse
where
pierre
was
standing
it
was
damp
bleak
and
sad
the
soldier
with
the
swollen
cheek
looked
angrily
at
the
cavalry
singers
some
songbirds
he
said
reproachfully
today
it
wasnt
just
soldiers
i
saw
peasants
too
they
even
drive
peasants
to
it
a
soldier
standing
behind
the
cart
said
with
a
sad
smile
addressing
pierre
no
sorting
them
out
nowadaysthey
want
the
whole
people
to
throw
their
weight
into
itmoscow
in
short
they
want
to
make
an
end
of
it
despite
the
vagueness
of
the
soldiers
words
pierre
understood
everything
he
meant
to
say
and
nodded
approvingly
the
road
cleared
and
pierre
went
down
the
hill
and
drove
on
pierre
drove
along
looking
on
both
sides
of
the
road
searching
for
familiar
faces
and
everywhere
meeting
only
the
unfamiliar
military
faces
of
various
kinds
of
troops
who
stared
with
identical
surprise
at
his
white
hat
and
green
tailcoat
having
gone
about
three
miles
he
met
a
first
acquaintance
and
joyfully
addressed
him
this
acquaintance
was
one
of
the
chief
doctors
of
the
army
he
was
coming
towards
pierre
in
a
britzka
with
a
young
doctor
sitting
beside
him
and
recognizing
pierre
told
his
cossack
who
sat
on
the
box
in
place
of
a
coachman
to
stop
count
your
excellency
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
the
doctor
i
just
wanted
to
have
a
look
yes
yes
therell
be
plenty
to
look
at
pierre
got
out
and
stopped
to
talk
with
the
doctor
explaining
to
him
his
intention
of
taking
the
battle
the
doctor
advised
bezukhov
to
address
himself
directly
to
his
serenity
why
should
you
be
god
knows
where
in
obscurity
during
the
battle
he
said
exchanging
glances
with
his
young
colleague
and
his
serenity
does
know
you
after
all
and
would
receive
you
graciously
thats
the
thing
to
do
old
boy
said
the
doctor
the
doctor
seemed
tired
and
hurried
you
think
soand
i
also
wanted
to
ask
you
where
is
the
actual
position
asked
pierre
position
said
the
doctor
thats
not
in
my
line
go
past
tatarinovo
where
all
the
diggings
going
on
climb
up
on
the
barrow
there
you
can
see
from
there
said
the
doctor
you
can
see
from
thereand
if
youd
but
the
doctor
interrupted
him
and
moved
towards
his
britzka
id
take
you
there
but
by
godyou
see
the
doctor
gestured
at
his
throat
im
racing
to
the
corps
commanders
how
are
things
with
usyou
know
count
tomorrows
the
battle
for
a
hundred
thousand
troops
we
must
figure
on
at
least
twenty
thousand
wounded
and
we
dont
have
enough
stretchers
or
beds
or
medics
or
doctors
for
even
six
thousand
there
are
ten
thousand
carts
but
we
need
other
things
as
well
so
do
as
you
like
the
strange
notion
that
among
those
thousands
of
men
alive
healthy
young
and
old
who
had
stared
with
merry
surprise
at
his
hat
there
were
probably
twenty
thousand
destined
for
wounds
and
death
maybe
the
same
ones
he
had
seen
struck
pierre
they
may
die
tomorrow
how
can
they
think
of
anything
else
but
death
and
suddenly
by
some
mysterious
linking
of
thoughts
he
vividly
pictured
the
descent
of
the
hill
in
mozhaisk
the
carts
with
the
wounded
the
ringing
bells
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
songs
of
the
cavalrymen
the
cavalrymen
go
to
battle
and
meet
the
wounded
and
they
dont
stop
to
reflect
for
a
moment
on
what
awaits
them
but
go
past
and
wink
at
the
wounded
and
twenty
thousand
of
them
are
doomed
to
die
yet
they
get
surprised
at
my
hat
strange
thought
pierre
heading
on
towards
tatarinovo
by
a
landowners
house
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
stood
carriages
wagons
crowds
of
orderlies
and
sentries
his
serenity
was
staying
here
but
at
the
time
of
pierres
arrival
he
was
not
there
and
there
was
almost
no
one
from
his
staff
they
were
all
at
a
prayer
service
pierre
drove
on
to
gorki
driving
up
a
hill
and
coming
to
a
small
village
street
pierre
saw
muzhik
militiamen
for
the
first
time
with
crosses
on
their
hats
and
white
shirts
who
with
loud
talk
and
laughter
lively
and
sweaty
were
doing
some
sort
of
work
to
the
right
of
the
road
on
an
enormous
barrow
overgrown
with
grass
some
of
them
were
digging
at
the
hill
with
shovels
others
were
transporting
dirt
over
planks
in
handcarts
still
others
stood
around
doing
nothing
two
officers
were
standing
on
the
barrow
giving
them
orders
seeing
these
muzhiks
who
obviously
still
enjoyed
their
new
military
situation
pierre
again
recalled
the
wounded
soldiers
in
mozhaisk
and
understood
what
the
soldier
had
meant
to
express
saying
they
want
the
whole
people
to
throw
their
weight
into
it
the
sight
of
these
bearded
muzhiks
working
on
the
battlefield
with
their
strange
clumsy
boots
with
their
sweaty
necks
and
some
with
their
sidebuttoned
shirts
open
revealing
their
sunburned
collarbones
impressed
pierre
more
strongly
than
anything
he
had
seen
or
heard
so
far
about
the
solemnity
and
significance
of
the
present
moment
xxi
pierre
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
and
went
past
the
laboring
militiamen
up
the
barrow
from
which
as
the
doctor
had
told
him
the
battlefield
could
be
seen
it
was
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
a
little
to
the
left
and
behind
pierre
and
through
the
clear
rarefied
air
shone
brightly
on
the
vast
panorama
that
opened
out
before
him
like
an
amphitheater
over
the
rising
terrain
cutting
through
the
upper
left
of
this
amphitheater
the
smolensk
high
road
wound
its
way
through
a
village
with
a
white
church
that
lay
five
hundred
paces
from
the
barrow
and
below
it
this
was
borodino
the
road
passed
under
the
village
across
a
bridge
and
ascending
and
descending
wound
higher
and
higher
up
to
the
village
of
valuevo
where
napoleon
was
now
staying
visible
some
four
miles
away
beyond
valuevo
the
road
disappeared
into
a
forest
that
showed
yellow
on
the
horizon
in
this
birch
and
fir
forest
to
the
right
of
the
road
the
distant
cross
and
bell
tower
of
the
kolotsky
monastery
shone
in
the
sun
all
over
this
blue
distance
to
right
and
left
of
the
forest
and
the
road
in
various
places
one
could
see
smoking
campfires
and
indefinite
masses
of
troops
ours
and
the
enemys
to
the
right
along
the
courses
of
the
kolocha
and
moskva
rivers
the
terrain
was
all
hills
and
gullies
between
their
gullies
in
the
distance
the
villages
of
bezzubovo
and
zakharyino
could
be
seen
to
the
left
the
terrain
was
more
level
there
were
grain
fields
and
one
smoking
burneddown
village
could
be
seensemyonovskoe
everything
pierre
saw
to
right
and
left
was
so
indefinite
that
neither
the
left
nor
the
right
side
of
the
field
fully
satisfied
his
notions
everywhere
there
were
fields
clearings
troops
woods
smoking
campfires
villages
barrows
streams
but
not
the
battlefield
he
had
expected
to
see
and
much
as
he
tried
to
make
it
out
on
this
living
terrain
he
could
not
find
a
position
and
could
not
even
distinguish
our
troops
from
the
enemys
i
must
ask
someone
who
knows
he
thought
and
turned
to
an
officer
who
was
looking
with
curiosity
at
his
enormous
nonmilitary
figure
allow
me
to
ask
pierre
addressed
the
officer
what
village
is
that
in
front
of
us
burdino
or
something
said
the
officer
turning
to
his
comrade
with
the
question
borodino
the
other
replied
correcting
him
the
officer
clearly
pleased
at
the
chance
to
talk
moved
closer
to
pierre
those
are
ours
there
asked
pierre
yes
and
those
further
away
are
the
french
said
the
officer
out
there
out
there
you
can
see
them
those
are
ours
asked
pierre
you
can
see
them
with
your
naked
eye
there
there
the
officer
pointed
to
some
smoke
visible
to
the
left
across
the
river
and
that
stern
and
serious
expression
appeared
on
his
face
which
pierre
had
seen
on
many
of
the
faces
he
had
met
ah
theyre
the
french
and
there
pierre
pointed
to
a
barrow
on
the
left
near
which
troops
could
be
seen
theyre
ours
ah
ours
and
there
pierre
pointed
to
another
distant
barrow
with
a
big
tree
near
a
village
visible
in
a
gully
where
campfires
were
also
smoking
and
something
showed
black
thats
him
again
said
the
officer
this
was
the
shevardino
redoubt
yesterday
it
was
ours
but
now
its
his
so
what
is
our
position
position
said
the
officer
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
that
i
can
tell
you
clearly
because
i
built
nearly
all
our
fortifications
there
you
see
is
our
center
in
borodino
just
there
he
pointed
to
the
village
with
the
white
church
straight
ahead
theres
the
crossing
over
the
kolocha
over
there
see
where
rows
of
cut
hay
are
still
lying
in
a
hollow
the
bridge
is
right
there
this
is
our
center
our
right
flank
is
over
there
he
pointed
sharply
to
the
right
far
into
the
gully
the
moskva
rivers
there
and
there
we
built
three
redoubts
very
strong
ones
the
left
flank
here
the
officer
paused
you
see
its
hard
to
explain
it
to
youyesterday
our
left
flank
was
there
in
shevardino
see
where
the
oak
tree
is
but
now
weve
moved
the
left
wing
back
now
its
down
there
theresee
the
village
and
the
smokethats
semyonovskoe
yes
its
there
he
pointed
to
the
raevsky
barrow
only
its
unlikely
the
battle
will
be
there
he
shifted
troops
there
but
its
a
trick
he
will
probably
go
around
to
the
right
of
the
moskva
well
but
wherever
it
is
well
have
a
lot
of
men
missing
tomorrow
said
the
officer
an
old
sergeant
who
came
up
to
the
officer
while
he
was
talking
was
waiting
silently
for
his
superior
to
finish
but
at
this
point
obviously
displeased
with
the
officers
words
he
interrupted
him
we
have
to
go
for
gabions
he
said
sternly
the
officer
seemed
embarrassed
as
if
he
realized
that
one
might
think
of
how
many
would
be
missing
the
next
day
but
one
ought
not
to
speak
of
it
ah
yes
send
the
third
platoon
again
he
said
hastily
and
you
are
whata
doctor
no
im
just
here
answered
pierre
and
he
went
down
the
hill
again
past
the
militiamen
ah
curse
them
the
officer
who
was
following
pierre
said
holding
his
nose
and
running
past
the
laborers
there
they
aretheyre
carrying
her
theyre
comingthere
they
aretheyll
be
here
in
a
moment
voices
were
suddenly
heard
and
officers
soldiers
and
militiamen
went
running
down
the
road
a
church
procession
from
borodino
was
coming
up
the
hill
ahead
of
them
all
on
the
dusty
road
moved
orderly
ranks
of
infantry
their
shakos
off
and
their
muskets
pointing
down
from
behind
the
infantry
came
the
sound
of
church
singing
overtaking
pierre
soldiers
and
militiamen
were
running
hatless
to
meet
the
procession
its
our
mother

corrected
the
militiamenboth
those
who
were
in
the
village
and
those
who
were
working
on
the
batterydropped
their
shovels
and
ran
to
meet
the
church
procession
behind
the
battalion
that
marched
down
the
dusty
road
came
priests
in
vestments
an
old
man
in
a
cowl
other
clergy
and
a
choir
behind
them
soldiers
and
officers
carried
a
large
darkfaced
icon
in
a
case
this
was
the
icon
brought
out
of
smolensk
which
had
since
been
carried
around
with
the
army
behind
the
icon
around
it
in
front
of
it
on
all
sides
crowds
of
bareheaded
soldiers
walked
ran
and
bowed
to
the
ground
having
come
up
the
hill
the
icon
stopped
the
people
who
were
holding
the
icon
on
towels
were
replaced
the
servers
lit
the
censers
and
the
prayer
service
began
the
suns
hot
rays
beat
down
vertically
from
above
a
faint
fresh
breeze
played
with
the
hair
of
the
bared
heads
and
the
ribbons
that
decorated
the
icon
the
singing
sounded
subdued
under
the
open
sky
a
huge
crowd
of
bareheaded
officers
soldiers
and
militiamen
surrounded
the
icon
behind
the
priest
and
the
deacon
on
a
cleared
space
stood
men
of
higher
rank
one
bald
general
with
a
st
george
on
his
neck
stood
directly
behind
the
priests
back
and
not
crossing
himself
obviously
a
german
waited
patiently
for
the
end
of
the
service
which
he
considered
it
necessary
to
hear
out
probably
to
arouse
the
patriotism
of
the
russian
people
another
general
stood
in
a
martial
pose
and
kept
fluttering
his
hand
in
front
of
his
chest
glancing
around
among
this
highranking
circle
pierre
who
was
standing
in
the
crowd
of
muzhiks
recognized
some
acquaintances
but
he
was
not
looking
at
them
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
by
the
serious
expression
of
the
faces
in
this
crowd
of
soldiers
and
militiamen
who
gazed
with
uniform
eagerness
at
the
icon
as
soon
as
the
weary
servers
who
were
singing
their
twentieth
prayer
service
began
lazily
and
habitually
to
sing
deliver
thy
servants
from
affliction
o
mother
of
god
and
the
priest
and
deacon
picked
up
for
in
god
we
flee
unto
thee
as
a
steadfast
wall
and
intercessorall
the
faces
lit
up
again
with
the
same
expression
of
awareness
of
the
solemnity
of
the
present
moment
that
he
had
seen
on
the
faces
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
in
mozhaisk
and
had
glimpsed
on
many
many
faces
he
had
met
that
morning
heads
were
bowed
more
frequently
hair
was
tossed
and
sighs
and
the
thump
of
crossings
on
breasts
were
heard
the
crowd
surrounding
the
icon
suddenly
parted
and
pressed
against
pierre
someone
probably
a
very
important
person
judging
by
the
haste
with
which
people
made
way
for
him
was
approaching
the
icon
it
was
kutuzov
going
the
rounds
of
the
position
on
his
way
back
to
tatarinovo
he
came
up
to
the
prayer
service
pierre
recognized
kutuzov
at
once
by
his
peculiar
figure
which
distinguished
him
from
everyone
else
in
a
long
coat
on
an
immensely
fat
body
with
a
somewhat
rounded
back
an
uncovered
white
head
a
blinded
white
eye
in
a
puffy
face
kutuzov
entered
the
circle
with
his
dipping
swaying
gait
and
stopped
behind
the
priest
he
crossed
himself
with
a
habitual
gesture
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand
and
sighing
deeply
bowed
his
gray
head
behind
kutuzov
came
bennigsen
and
the
suite
despite
the
presence
of
the
commander
in
chief
who
drew
the
attention
of
all
the
higher
ranks
the
militiamen
and
soldiers
without
looking
at
him
went
on
praying
when
the
service
was
over
kutuzov
went
up
to
the
icon
knelt
down
heavily
bowed
to
the
ground
and
for
a
long
time
tried
and
was
unable
to
stand
up
because
of
his
heaviness
and
weakness
his
gray
head
twitched
with
the
effort
finally
he
stood
up
and
with
a
childishly
na239ve
puckering
of
the
lips
kissed
the
icon
and
bowed
again
touching
the
ground
with
his
hand
the
generals
followed
his
example
then
the
officers
and
after
them
crushing
each
other
stamping
puffing
and
jostling
with
excited
faces
came
the
soldiers
and
militiamen
xxii
reeling
from
the
crush
he
was
caught
up
in
pierre
glanced
about
count
pyotr
kirilych
what
are
you
doing
here
said
someones
voice
pierre
turned
to
look
boris
drubetskoy
brushing
his
knees
with
his
hand
he
had
probably
dirtied
them
venerating
the
icon
smiling
was
approaching
pierre
boris
was
elegantly
dressed
with
a
hint
of
the
soldier
on
campaign
he
was
wearing
a
long
tunic
and
a
whip
over
his
shoulder
just
like
kutuzov
kutuzov
meanwhile
went
to
the
village
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
the
nearest
house
on
a
bench
which
one
cossack
ran
to
fetch
and
another
quickly
covered
with
a
rug
an
immense
brilliant
suite
surrounded
the
commander
in
chief
the
icon
started
off
again
accompanied
by
the
crowd
pierre
stopped
some
thirty
paces
from
kutuzov
talking
to
boris
pierre
explained
his
intention
of
taking
the
battle
and
looking
over
the
position
heres
how
to
do
it
said
boris
je
vous
ferai
les
honneurs
du
camp
youll
see
everything
best
from
where
count
bennigsen
is
im
attached
to
him
ill
tell
him
and
if
you
want
to
ride
around
the
position
come
with
us
were
now
going
to
the
left
flank
and
then
well
come
back
and
youre
welcome
to
spend
the
night
with
me
and
well
get
up
a
game
of
cards
you
know
dmitri
sergeich
hes
staying
here
he
pointed
to
the
third
house
in
gorki
but
id
like
to
see
the
right
flank
they
say
its
very
strong
said
pierre
id
like
to
start
from
the
moskva
river
and
ride
around
the
whole
position
well
you
can
do
that
later
but
the
main
thing
is
the
left
flank
yes
yes
and
where
is
prince
bolkonskys
regiment
can
you
point
it
out
for
me
asked
pierre
andrei
nikolaevichs
well
go
past
it
ill
take
you
to
him
so
what
about
the
left
flank
asked
pierre
to
tell
you
the
truth
entre
nous
our
left
flank
is
in
god
knows
what
state
said
boris
lowering
his
voice
confidentially
count
bennigsen
proposed
something
quite
different
he
proposed
fortifying
that
barrow
over
there
not
at
all
likebut
boris
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
serenity
didnt
want
to
or
somebody
talked
him
out
of
it
you
know
and
boris
did
not
finish
because
just
then
kaisarov
kutuzovs
adjutant
came
up
to
pierre
ah
pa239ssy
sergeich
said
boris
addressing
kaisarov
with
an
easy
smile
im
trying
to
explain
the
position
to
the
count
its
astonishing
how
his
serenity
could
guess
the
intentions
of
the
french
so
correctly
you
mean
the
left
flank
said
kaisarov
yes
yes
precisely
our
left
flank
is
now
very
very
strong
though
kutuzov
had
chased
out
all
the
superfluous
men
of
the
staff
boris
after
the
changes
made
by
kutuzov
had
been
able
to
maintain
himself
at
headquarters
boris
had
attached
himself
to
count
bennigsen
count
bennigsen
like
all
the
men
on
whom
boris
had
been
in
attendance
considered
the
young
prince
drubetskoy
an
invaluable
man
in
the
armys
high
command
there
were
two
clearcut
welldefined
parties
the
party
of
kutuzov
and
the
party
of
bennigsen
the
chief
of
staff
boris
belonged
to
the
latter
party
and
no
one
knew
so
well
as
he
how
while
rendering
servile
respect
to
kutuzov
to
make
it
felt
that
the
old
man
was
no
good
and
that
everything
was
being
conducted
by
bennigsen
now
the
decisive
moment
of
battle
had
come
which
should
either
destroy
kutuzov
and
hand
power
over
to
bennigsen
or
even
if
kutuzov
won
the
battle
make
it
felt
that
it
had
all
been
done
by
bennigsen
in
any
case
for
tomorrow
big
rewards
should
be
given
out
and
new
men
brought
to
the
fore
and
owing
to
that
boris
was
in
nervous
animation
all
that
day
after
kaisarov
other
acquaintances
came
up
to
pierre
and
he
had
no
time
to
answer
all
the
questions
about
moscow
that
they
showered
him
with
or
to
listen
to
the
stories
they
told
him
animation
and
anxiety
showed
on
all
their
faces
but
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
the
cause
of
the
agitation
which
showed
on
some
of
these
faces
lay
mostly
in
questions
of
personal
success
and
he
could
not
get
out
of
his
head
those
other
expressions
of
agitation
which
he
had
seen
on
other
faces
and
which
spoke
of
questions
that
were
not
personal
but
general
questions
of
life
and
death
kutuzov
noticed
pierres
figure
and
the
group
that
had
gathered
around
him
call
him
over
to
me
said
kutuzov
the
adjutant
conveyed
his
serenitys
wish
and
pierre
went
towards
the
bench
but
before
him
a
rankandfile
militiaman
came
up
to
kutuzov
it
was
dolokhov
whats
that
one
doing
here
asked
pierre
hes
such
a
sly
fox
he
slips
in
everywhere
came
the
answer
you
see
he
was
reduced
to
the
ranks
now
he
has
to
get
jumping
hes
been
submitting
some
projects
snuck
behind
the
enemys
lines
at
nightbut
a
fine
fellow
pierre
taking
off
his
hat
bowed
respectfully
to
kutuzov
i
decided
that
if
i
report
to
your
serenity
you
can
chase
me
away
or
tell
me
you
already
know
what
im
reporting
and
ill
be
none
the
worse
for
it
dolokhov
was
saying
yes
yes
but
if
im
right
then
ill
be
of
benefit
to
the
fatherland
for
which
im
prepared
to
die
yesyes
and
if
your
serenity
needs
a
man
who
wont
spare
his
hide
please
remember
memaybe
ill
prove
useful
to
your
serenity
yesyes
kutuzov
repeated
looking
at
pierre
with
his
laughing
narrowing
eye
just
then
boris
with
his
courtly
adroitness
moved
up
next
to
pierre
in
proximity
to
his
superior
and
with
the
most
natural
air
and
not
loudly
as
if
continuing
a
conversation
they
had
already
begun
said
to
pierre
the
militiamenthey
just
went
and
put
on
clean
white
shirts
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
death
such
heroism
count
boris
said
it
to
pierre
in
order
to
be
heard
by
his
serenity
he
knew
that
kutuzov
would
pay
attention
to
these
words
and
in
fact
his
serenity
addressed
him
whats
that
youre
saying
about
the
militia
he
said
to
boris
theyve
put
on
white
shirts
your
serenity
getting
ready
for
tomorrow
for
death
ahwonderful
incomparable
people
said
kutuzov
and
closing
his
eyes
he
shook
his
head
incomparable
people
he
said
with
a
sigh
so
you
want
a
whiff
of
powder
he
said
to
pierre
yes
a
pleasant
smell
i
have
the
honor
of
being
an
admirer
of
your
spouse
is
she
well
my
camp
is
at
your
service
and
as
often
happens
with
old
people
kutuzov
started
looking
around
absentmindedly
as
if
forgetting
all
he
had
to
say
or
do
evidently
recalling
what
he
was
searching
for
he
beckoned
to
andrei
sergeich
kaisarov
his
adjutants
brother
how
how
do
they
go
those
verses
of
marins
how
do
they
go
what
he
wrote
on
gerakov
youll
be
a
teacher
in
the
corps
recite
it
recite
it
said
kutuzov
obviously
getting
ready
to
laugh
kaisarov
recitedkutuzov
smiling
nodded
his
head
in
rhythm
with
the
verses
when
pierre
left
kutuzov
dolokhov
coming
up
to
him
offered
him
his
hand
very
glad
to
meet
you
here
count
he
said
to
him
loudly
and
unembarrassed
by
the
presence
of
strangers
with
particular
resoluteness
and
solemnity
on
the
eve
of
a
day
when
god
knows
who
of
us
is
destined
to
remain
alive
im
glad
of
the
chance
to
tell
you
that
i
regret
the
misunderstandings
that
occurred
between
us
and
would
wish
that
you
not
have
anything
against
me
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
pierre
smiling
gazed
at
dolokhov
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
him
dolokhov
with
tears
in
his
eyes
embraced
and
kissed
pierre
boris
said
something
to
his
general
and
count
bennigsen
turned
to
pierre
and
proposed
that
he
come
with
him
along
the
line
it
will
be
interesting
for
you
he
said
yes
very
interesting
said
pierre
half
an
hour
later
kutuzov
left
for
tatarinovo
and
bennigsen
with
the
suite
pierre
among
them
rode
along
the
line
xxiii
from
gorki
bennigsen
went
down
by
the
high
road
to
the
bridge
that
the
officer
on
the
barrow
had
pointed
out
to
pierre
as
the
center
of
the
position
and
near
which
rows
of
mowed
grass
smelling
of
hay
lay
on
the
riverbank
crossing
the
bridge
they
rode
to
the
village
of
borodino
where
they
turned
left
and
passing
huge
numbers
of
troops
and
cannon
came
to
a
high
barrow
on
which
militiamen
were
digging
up
the
ground
this
was
the
redoubt
as
yet
unnamed
later
known
as
the
raevsky
redoubt
or
the
battery
of
the
barrow
pierre
paid
no
particular
attention
to
this
redoubt
he
did
not
know
that
for
him
it
would
be
the
most
memorable
place
on
the
field
of
borodino
then
they
crossed
the
ravine
to
semyonovskoe
where
soldiers
were
pulling
down
the
last
logs
of
the
cottages
and
barns
then
downhill
and
uphill
they
rode
on
through
broken
rye
beaten
down
as
if
by
hail
along
a
road
newly
made
by
the
artillery
across
the
furrows
of
a
plowed
field
to
the
fl232ches
which
were
still
being
dug
bennigsen
stopped
at
the
fl232ches
and
began
looking
ahead
at
the
shevardino
redoubt
still
ours
yesterday
on
which
several
horsemen
could
be
seen
the
officers
said
that
napoleon
or
murat
was
there
and
everybody
looked
eagerly
at
this
bunch
of
horsemen
pierre
also
looked
trying
to
guess
which
of
those
barely
visible
men
was
napoleon
finally
the
horsemen
rode
down
off
the
barrow
and
disappeared
from
sight
bennigsen
turned
to
a
general
who
came
up
to
him
and
started
explaining
the
disposition
of
our
troops
pierre
listened
to
bennigsens
words
straining
all
his
mental
forces
in
order
to
understand
the
essence
of
the
forthcoming
battle
but
felt
with
chagrin
that
his
mental
ability
was
insufficient
for
that
he
understood
nothing
bennigsen
stopped
talking
and
noticing
the
figure
of
the
listening
pierre
suddenly
said
turning
to
him
i
suppose
you
find
this
uninteresting
oh
on
the
contrary
very
interesting
pierre
said
not
quite
truthfully
from
the
fl232ches
they
rode
still
further
to
the
left
on
a
road
winding
through
a
dense
not
very
tall
birch
woods
in
the
middle
of
this
woods
a
brown
hare
with
white
legs
jumped
out
onto
the
road
in
front
of
them
and
frightened
by
the
hoofbeats
of
the
large
number
of
horses
became
so
confused
that
it
leaped
along
the
road
in
front
of
them
for
a
long
time
arousing
general
attention
and
laughter
and
only
when
several
voices
shouted
at
it
did
it
dash
to
the
side
and
disappear
into
the
thicket
having
gone
a
mile
and
a
half
through
the
woods
they
came
out
into
a
clearing
where
the
troops
of
tuchkovs
corps
were
stationed
who
were
supposed
to
defend
the
left
flank
here
at
the
extreme
left
flank
bennigsen
spoke
a
great
deal
and
vehemently
and
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
gave
instructions
that
were
important
in
a
military
respect
in
front
of
the
disposition
of
tuchkovs
troops
there
was
an
elevation
this
elevation
was
not
occupied
by
troops
bennigsen
loudly
criticized
this
error
saying
that
it
was
mad
to
leave
a
height
that
commanded
the
terrain
unoccupied
and
place
troops
at
the
foot
of
it
some
generals
expressed
the
same
opinion
one
in
particular
said
with
military
vehemence
that
they
had
been
put
there
to
be
slaughtered
bennigsen
ordered
in
his
own
name
that
the
troops
be
moved
to
the
height
this
instruction
to
the
left
flank
made
pierre
doubt
still
more
his
ability
to
understand
military
matters
listening
to
bennigsen
and
the
generals
discussing
the
position
of
the
troops
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
pierre
fully
understood
them
and
shared
their
opinion
but
precisely
for
that
reason
he
could
not
understand
how
the
one
who
had
placed
them
there
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
could
have
made
such
an
obvious
and
crude
mistake
pierre
did
not
know
that
these
troops
had
been
placed
there
not
to
defend
the
position
as
bennigsen
thought
but
had
been
put
in
a
concealed
spot
for
an
ambush
that
is
so
as
to
remain
unobserved
and
suddenly
strike
at
the
advancing
enemy
bennigsen
did
not
know
that
and
moved
the
troops
forward
for
his
own
reasons
saying
nothing
about
it
to
the
commander
in
chief
xxiv
on
that
clear
august
evening
of
the
twentyfifth
prince
andrei
lay
propped
on
his
elbow
in
a
brokenup
shed
in
the
village
of
knyazkovo
at
the
edge
of
his
regiments
disposition
through
an
opening
in
the
broken
wall
he
looked
at
a
row
of
thirtyyearold
birches
with
choppedoff
lower
branches
that
ran
along
a
fence
at
a
field
with
stacks
of
oats
on
it
and
at
some
bushes
in
which
the
smoke
of
campfiresthe
soldiers
kitchenscould
be
seen
narrow
and
unnecessary
to
anyone
and
burdensome
as
prince
andreis
life
now
seemed
to
him
he
felt
excited
and
nervous
on
the
eve
of
battle
just
as
at
austerlitz
seven
years
earlier
the
orders
for
tomorrows
battle
had
been
given
and
received
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
the
most
simple
clear
and
therefore
dreadful
thoughts
would
not
leave
him
in
peace
he
knew
that
tomorrows
battle
was
to
be
the
most
dreadful
of
all
he
had
taken
and
the
possibility
of
death
presented
itself
to
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
with
no
relation
to
the
everyday
with
no
considerations
of
how
it
would
affect
others
but
only
in
relation
to
himself
to
his
soul
vividly
almost
with
certainty
simply
and
terribly
and
from
the
height
of
that
picture
all
that
used
to
torment
and
preoccupy
him
was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
cold
white
light
without
shadows
without
perspective
without
clearcut
outlines
the
whole
of
life
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
magic
lantern
into
which
he
had
long
been
looking
through
a
glass
and
in
artificial
light
now
he
suddenly
saw
these
badly
daubed
pictures
without
a
glass
in
bright
daylight
yes
yes
there
they
are
those
false
images
that
excited
and
delighted
and
tormented
me
he
said
to
himself
turning
over
in
his
imagination
the
main
pictures
of
his
magic
lantern
of
life
looking
at
them
now
in
that
cold
white
daylightthe
clear
notion
of
death
there
they
are
those
crudely
daubed
figures
which
had
presented
themselves
as
something
beautiful
and
mysterious
glory
the
general
good
the
love
of
a
woman
the
fatherland
itselfhow
grand
those
pictures
seemed
to
me
how
filled
with
deep
meaning
and
its
all
so
simple
pale
and
crude
in
the
cold
white
light
of
the
morning
that
i
feel
is
dawning
for
me
three
main
griefs
of
his
life
especially
held
his
attention
his
love
of
a
woman
the
death
of
his
father
and
the
french
invasion
that
had
seized
half
of
russia
love
that
girl
who
seemed
to
me
all
filled
with
mysterious
forces
how
i
loved
her
i
made
poetic
plans
of
love
of
happiness
with
her
oh
you
dear
boy
he
said
angrily
aloud
what
else
i
believed
in
some
sort
of
ideal
love
which
was
to
keep
her
faithful
to
me
for
the
whole
year
of
my
absence
like
the
tender
dove
in
the
fable
she
was
to
pine
away
in
my
absence
but
its
all
so
much
simplerits
all
terribly
simple
and
vile
my
father
also
built
at
bald
hills
and
thought
it
was
his
place
his
land
his
air
his
muzhiks
but
napoleon
came
and
not
knowing
of
his
existence
brushed
him
aside
like
a
chip
of
wood
and
bald
hills
and
his
whole
life
fell
apart
and
princess
marya
says
its
a
trial
from
on
high
why
a
trial
when
hes
no
more
and
never
will
be
never
will
be
again
hes
no
more
so
for
whom
is
it
a
trial
the
fatherland
the
destruction
of
moscow
and
tomorrow
ill
be
killednot
even
by
a
frenchman
but
by
one
of
our
soldiers
like
the
one
yesterday
who
fired
his
gun
just
next
to
my
earand
the
french
will
come
take
me
by
the
feet
and
head
and
fling
me
into
a
pit
so
as
not
to
have
me
stink
under
their
noses
and
new
conditions
of
life
will
take
shape
which
will
become
habitual
for
other
people
and
i
wont
know
about
them
and
i
wont
be
there
he
looked
at
the
line
of
birches
with
their
motionless
yellow
and
green
leaves
and
white
bark
gleaming
in
the
sun
to
die
to
be
killed
tomorrow
to
be
no
moreso
that
all
this
is
here
and
i
am
not
he
pictured
vividly
to
himself
his
absence
from
this
life
and
the
birches
with
their
light
and
shade
and
the
fleecy
clouds
and
the
smoke
of
the
campfireseverything
around
was
transfigured
for
him
and
appeared
as
something
dreadful
and
menacing
a
chill
ran
down
his
spine
getting
up
quickly
he
left
the
shed
paced
about
and
went
back
in
voices
came
from
outside
the
shed
whos
there
prince
andrei
called
out
rednosed
captain
timokhin
formerly
dolokhovs
company
commander
and
now
as
the
numbers
of
officers
diminished
a
battalion
commander
timidly
came
into
the
shed
after
him
came
an
adjutant
and
the
regimental
paymaster
prince
andrei
hastily
got
up
listened
to
what
the
officers
had
to
tell
him
in
the
line
of
duty
gave
them
some
further
orders
and
was
about
to
dismiss
them
when
he
heard
a
familiar
lisping
voice
from
outside
the
shed
que
diable
said
the
voice
of
a
man
who
had
run
into
something
prince
andrei
looked
out
of
the
shed
and
saw
pierre
who
had
stumbled
over
a
pole
that
was
lying
there
and
nearly
fallen
it
was
generally
unpleasant
for
prince
andrei
to
see
people
from
his
world
especially
pierre
who
reminded
him
of
all
those
painful
moments
he
had
lived
through
during
his
last
visit
to
moscow
ah
look
at
that
he
said
what
fate
brings
you
here
id
never
have
expected
it
as
he
said
this
there
was
something
more
than
dryness
in
his
eyes
and
the
expression
of
his
whole
facethere
was
a
hostility
that
pierre
noticed
at
once
he
was
approaching
the
shed
in
the
most
animated
state
of
mind
but
seeing
the
expression
on
prince
andreis
face
he
felt
embarrassed
and
awkward
ive
comejustyou
knowive
comeits
interesting
said
pierre
who
had
repeated
the
senseless
word
interesting
so
many
times
that
day
i
wanted
to
see
the
battle
yes
yes
and
what
do
your
brother
masons
say
about
war
is
there
a
way
to
prevent
it
prince
andrei
said
mockingly
well
what
about
moscow
what
about
my
people
have
they
finally
come
to
moscow
he
asked
seriously
yes
julie
drubetskoy
told
me
i
went
to
see
them
but
missed
them
theyd
gone
to
the
estate
outside
moscow
xxv
the
officers
wanted
to
take
their
leave
but
prince
andrei
as
if
unwilling
to
be
left
alone
with
his
friend
invited
them
to
stay
and
have
tea
benches
and
tea
were
brought
the
officers
looked
not
without
surprise
at
pierres
fat
enormous
figure
and
listened
to
his
stories
about
moscow
and
about
the
disposition
of
our
troops
which
he
had
managed
to
ride
around
prince
andrei
was
silent
and
his
face
was
so
unpleasant
that
pierre
addressed
himself
more
to
the
goodnatured
battalion
commander
timokhin
than
to
bolkonsky
so
youve
understood
the
whole
disposition
of
the
troops
prince
andrei
interrupted
him
how
do
you
mean
said
pierre
as
a
nonmilitary
man
i
cant
say
i
do
fully
but
anyhow
i
understand
the
general
disposition
eh
bien
vous
234tes
plus
avanc233
que
qui
cela
soit
said
prince
andrei
ah
pierre
said
with
perplexity
looking
through
his
spectacles
at
prince
andrei
well
what
do
you
say
about
the
appointment
of
kutuzov
he
asked
i
was
very
glad
of
his
appointment
thats
all
i
know
said
prince
andrei
well
and
tell
me
whats
your
opinion
of
barclay
de
tolly
in
moscow
theyre
saying
god
knows
what
about
him
how
do
you
judge
him
ask
them
said
prince
andrei
pointing
to
the
officers
pierre
looked
at
timokhin
with
the
condescendingly
questioning
smile
with
which
everyone
involuntarily
addressed
him
light
has
shone
on
us
your
excellency
since
his
serenity
took
over
timokhin
said
timidly
glancing
continually
at
his
regimental
commander
how
so
asked
pierre
why
just
as
regards
firewood
and
fodder
i
must
tell
you
you
see
we
were
retreating
from
swienciany
not
daring
to
touch
a
twig
or
a
wisp
of
hay
there
or
anything
you
see
we
were
leaving
so
he
would
get
it
right
your
excellency
he
turned
to
his
prince
but
dont
you
dare
in
our
regiment
two
officers
were
tried
for
that
sort
of
thing
well
as
soon
as
his
serenity
took
over
it
got
simple
in
that
regard
light
has
shone
on
us
then
why
was
it
forbidden
before
timokhin
looked
around
in
confusion
not
understanding
how
and
what
to
answer
to
such
a
question
pierre
turned
with
the
same
question
to
prince
andrei
so
as
not
to
devastate
the
country
we
were
abandoning
to
the
enemy
prince
andrei
said
with
spiteful
mockery
its
very
sound
troops
shouldnt
be
allowed
to
pillage
the
countryside
and
get
accustomed
to
looting
and
in
smolensk
he
also
reasoned
correctly
that
the
french
might
outflank
us
and
that
they
had
the
greater
force
but
he
could
not
understand
prince
andrei
cried
in
a
high
voice
as
if
suddenly
bursting
out
he
could
not
understand
that
there
it
was
the
first
time
we
were
fighting
for
russian
soil
that
the
spirit
in
the
troops
was
such
as
ive
never
seen
that
we
beat
back
the
french
for
two
days
in
a
row
and
that
that
success
increased
our
strength
ten
times
he
ordered
a
retreat
and
all
our
efforts
and
losses
went
for
nothing
he
wasnt
thinking
of
treason
he
was
trying
to
do
everything
in
the
best
possible
way
he
thought
it
all
over
but
that
is
why
hes
unfit
hes
unfit
now
precisely
because
he
thinks
everything
over
very
thoroughly
and
precisely
as
every
german
ought
to
do
how
shall
i
put
itwell
say
your
father
has
a
german
valet
and
hes
an
excellent
valet
and
will
satisfy
all
his
needs
better
than
you
so
let
him
serve
but
if
your
fathers
mortally
ill
youll
send
the
valet
away
and
take
care
of
your
father
with
your
unaccustomed
clumsy
hands
and
comfort
him
better
than
any
skillful
stranger
thats
whats
been
done
with
barclay
as
long
as
russia
was
healthy
a
stranger
could
serve
her
and
be
an
excellent
minister
but
once
shes
in
danger
she
needs
her
own
man
one
of
the
family
but
in
your
club
you
came
up
with
the
idea
that
he
was
a
traitor
the
only
result
of
that
slander
will
be
that
later
feeling
ashamed
of
your
own
false
reproach
youll
turn
him
from
a
traitor
suddenly
into
a
hero
or
a
genius
which
will
be
still
more
incorrect
hes
an
honest
and
very
precise
german
however
they
say
hes
a
skilled
commander
said
pierre
i
dont
understand
what
is
meant
by
a
skilled
commander
prince
andrei
said
mockingly
a
skilled
commander
said
pierre
well
hes
one
who
has
foreseen
all
possibilitieswell
who
has
guessed
the
thoughts
of
his
adversary
thats
impossible
said
prince
andrei
as
if
the
matter
had
long
been
decided
pierre
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
however
he
said
they
do
say
that
war
is
like
a
game
of
chess
yes
said
prince
andrei
only
with
this
small
difference
that
in
chess
you
can
think
over
each
move
as
long
as
you
like
youre
outside
the
conditions
of
time
and
with
this
difference
too
that
a
knight
is
always
stronger
than
a
pawn
and
two
pawns
are
always
stronger
than
one
while
in
war
one
battalion
is
sometimes
stronger
than
a
division
and
sometimes
weaker
than
a
company
nobody
can
know
the
relative
strength
of
the
troops
believe
me
he
said
if
anything
depended
on
instructions
from
the
staff
id
be
there
giving
instructions
but
instead
i
have
the
honor
of
serving
here
in
the
regiment
with
these
gentlemen
and
i
think
its
really
on
us
that
tomorrow
depends
not
on
themsuccess
never
did
and
never
will
depend
on
position
or
on
ammunition
or
even
on
numbers
but
least
of
all
on
position
but
on
what
then
on
the
feeling
thats
in
me
in
him
he
pointed
to
timokhin
in
every
soldier
prince
andrei
glanced
at
timokhin
who
was
looking
fearfully
and
perplexedly
at
his
commander
in
contrast
to
his
former
restrained
taciturnity
prince
andrei
now
seemed
excited
he
clearly
could
not
keep
from
expressing
these
thoughts
which
came
to
him
unexpectedly
a
battle
is
won
by
him
who
is
firmly
resolved
to
win
it
why
did
we
lose
the
battle
of
austerlitz
the
french
losses
were
almost
equal
to
ours
but
we
said
to
ourselves
early
on
that
we
had
lost
the
battleand
so
we
lost
it
we
said
that
because
there
was
no
need
for
us
to
fight
we
wanted
to
leave
the
battlefield
as
soon
as
we
could
weve
lostwell
lets
run
for
it
and
we
ran
if
we
hadnt
said
it
by
evening
god
knows
what
would
have
happened
but
tomorrow
we
wont
say
it
you
say
our
position
the
left
flank
is
weak
the
right
is
overextended
he
went
on
thats
all
nonsense
it
amounts
to
nothing
but
what
faces
us
tomorrow
a
hundred
million
of
the
most
varied
possibilities
which
will
be
decided
instantly
by
who
runs
or
will
run
away
theirs
or
ours
by
whether
this
one
or
that
is
killed
but
whats
being
done
now
is
all
just
an
amusement
the
thing
is
that
the
men
you
rode
around
the
position
with
not
only
dont
contribute
to
the
general
course
of
things
but
hinder
it
theyre
concerned
only
with
their
own
little
interests
at
such
a
moment
pierre
said
reproachfully
at
such
a
moment
prince
andrei
repeated
for
them
its
only
the
moment
when
they
can
undermine
a
rival
and
acquire
one
more
little
cross
or
ribbon
for
me
tomorrow
is
this
a
hundred
thousand
russian
and
a
hundred
thousand
french
troops
have
come
together
to
fight
and
the
fact
is
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
men
will
fight
and
whoever
fights
hardest
and
spares
himself
least
will
win
and
if
you
like
ill
tell
you
that
whatever
goes
on
there
whatever
muddle
they
make
at
the
top
well
win
the
battle
tomorrow
tomorrow
whatever
goes
on
there
well
win
the
battle
thats
the
truth
your
excellency
thats
the
veritable
truth
said
timokhin
no
sparing
ourselves
now
the
soldiers
in
my
battalion
if
you
can
believe
it
refused
to
drink
their
vodka
not
on
such
a
day
they
said
everybody
fell
silent
the
officers
stood
up
prince
andrei
went
out
of
the
shed
with
them
giving
his
last
orders
to
the
adjutant
when
the
officers
had
gone
pierre
went
up
to
prince
andrei
and
was
just
about
to
begin
a
conversation
when
on
the
road
not
far
from
the
shed
the
hoofbeats
of
three
horses
were
heard
and
glancing
in
that
direction
prince
andrei
recognized
wolzogen
and
clausewitz
accompanied
by
a
cossack
they
passed
close
by
continuing
to
converse
and
pierre
and
andrei
involuntarily
heard
the
following
phrases
der
krieg
muss
im
raum
verlegt
werden
der
ansicht
kann
ich
nicht
genug
preis
geben
said
one
o
ja
said
the
other
voice
da
der
zweck
ist
nur
den
feind
zu
schw228chen
so
kann
man
gewiss
nicht
den
verlust
der
privatpersonen
in
achtung
nehmen
o
ja
the
first
voice
confirmed
yes
im
raum
verlegen
prince
andrei
repeated
snorting
angrily
when
they
had
ridden
by
im
this
raum
i
had
a
father
and
a
son
and
a
sister
in
bald
hills
its
all
the
same
to
him
theres
what
i
was
saying
to
youtomorrow
these
german
gentlemen
wont
win
the
battle
theyll
only
muck
things
up
as
much
as
they
can
because
all
there
is
in
a
german
head
is
reasoning
which
isnt
worth
a
tinkers
damn
but
in
their
hearts
they
havent
got
the
one
thing
needed
for
tomorrowwhich
is
whats
in
timokhin
they
gave
him
the
whole
of
europe
and
came
to
teach
us
fine
teachers
his
voice
shrieked
again
so
you
think
the
battle
will
be
won
tomorrow
said
pierre
yes
yes
prince
andrei
said
distractedly
one
thing
i
would
do
if
i
had
power
he
began
again
i
would
not
take
prisoners
what
are
prisoners
its
chivalry
the
french
devastated
my
home
and
are
on
their
way
to
devastate
moscow
and
theyve
offended
me
and
offend
me
every
second
theyre
my
enemies
theyre
all
criminals
to
my
mind
and
timokhin
and
the
whole
army
think
the
same
they
must
be
executed
if
theyre
my
enemies
they
cant
be
friends
whatever
they
may
have
talked
about
in
tilsit
yes
yes
said
pierre
gazing
at
prince
andrei
with
flashing
eyes
i
agree
with
you
completely
completely
the
question
that
had
been
troubling
pierre
ever
since
the
hill
in
mozhaisk
and
all
that
day
now
presented
itself
to
him
as
perfectly
clear
and
fully
resolved
he
now
understood
the
whole
meaning
and
the
whole
significance
of
this
war
and
the
impending
battle
everything
he
had
seen
that
day
all
the
significant
stern
expressions
on
the
faces
he
had
seen
flash
by
appeared
to
him
in
a
new
light
he
understood
that
hiddenlatente
as
they
say
in
physicswarmth
of
patriotism
which
was
in
all
the
people
he
had
seen
and
which
explained
for
him
why
all
those
people
were
calmly
and
as
if
lightmindedly
preparing
for
death
take
no
prisoners
prince
andrei
went
on
that
alone
would
change
the
whole
war
and
make
it
less
cruel
as
it
is
weve
been
playing
at
warthats
the
nasty
thing
we
act
magnanimously
and
all
that
its
like
the
magnanimity
and
sentimentality
of
the
lady
who
swoons
when
she
sees
a
calf
slaughtered
shes
so
kind
she
cant
bear
the
sight
of
blood
but
she
eats
the
same
calf
in
sauce
with
great
appetite
were
told
about
the
rules
of
war
about
chivalry
about
parleying
sparing
the
unfortunate
and
so
on
its
all
nonsense
i
saw
chivalry
and
parleying
in
1805
they
cheated
us
we
cheated
them
they
loot
other
peoples
houses
spread
false
banknotes
and
worst
of
allkill
my
children
and
my
father
and
then
talk
about
the
rules
of
war
and
magnanimity
towards
the
enemy
take
no
prisoners
but
kill
and
go
to
your
death
whoever
has
come
to
this
as
i
have
through
the
same
sufferings
prince
andrei
who
had
thought
that
it
made
no
difference
to
him
whether
moscow
was
or
was
not
taken
as
smolensk
had
been
all
at
once
stopped
in
his
speech
from
an
unexpected
spasm
that
seized
his
throat
he
silently
paced
up
and
down
a
few
times
but
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
his
lips
trembled
when
he
began
to
speak
again
if
there
was
none
of
this
magnanimity
in
war
wed
go
to
it
only
when
it
was
worth
going
to
certain
death
as
now
then
there
would
be
no
war
because
pavel
ivanych
offended
mikhail
ivanych
but
if
theres
war
like
now
then
its
war
and
then
the
intensity
of
the
troops
would
not
be
like
now
then
all
these
westphalians
and
hessians
led
by
napoleon
wouldnt
follow
him
to
russia
and
we
wouldnt
go
to
fight
in
austria
and
prussia
not
knowing
why
ourselves
war
isnt
courtesy
its
the
vilest
thing
in
the
world
and
we
must
understand
that
and
not
play
at
war
we
must
take
this
terrible
necessity
sternly
and
seriously
thats
the
whole
point
to
cast
off
the
lie
and
if
its
war
its
war
and
not
a
game
as
it
is
war
is
the
favorite
pastime
of
idle
and
lightminded
peoplethe
military
estate
is
the
most
honored
but
what
is
war
what
is
needed
for
success
in
military
affairs
what
are
the
morals
of
military
society
the
aim
of
war
is
killing
the
instruments
of
war
are
espionage
treason
and
the
encouragement
of
it
the
ruin
of
the
inhabitants
robbing
them
or
stealing
to
supply
the
army
deception
and
lying
are
called
military
stratagems
the
morals
of
the
military
estate
are
absence
of
freedom
that
is
discipline
idleness
ignorance
cruelty
depravity
and
drunkenness
and
in
spite
of
that
it
is
the
highest
estate
respected
by
all
all
kings
except
the
chinese
wear
military
uniforms
and
the
one
who
has
killed
the
most
people
gets
the
greatest
rewardthey
come
together
like
tomorrow
to
kill
each
other
they
slaughter
and
maim
tens
of
thousands
of
men
and
then
they
say
prayers
of
thanksgiving
for
having
slaughtered
so
many
people
inflating
the
numbers
and
proclaim
victory
supposing
that
the
more
people
slaughtered
the
greater
the
merit
how
does
god
look
down
and
listen
to
them
prince
andrei
cried
in
a
high
squeaky
voice
ah
dear
heart
lately
its
become
hard
for
me
to
live
i
see
that
ive
begun
to
understand
too
much
and
its
not
good
for
man
to
taste
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evilwell
it
wont
be
for
long
he
added
however
youre
falling
asleep
and
its
time
i
did
too
go
back
to
gorki
prince
andrei
said
suddenly
oh
no
pierre
replied
looking
at
prince
andrei
with
frightened
commiserating
eyes
go
go
one
needs
a
good
nights
sleep
before
a
battle
prince
andrei
repeated
he
went
quickly
up
to
pierre
embraced
and
kissed
him
goodbye
off
with
you
he
cried
whether
we
see
each
other
again
or
not
and
turning
hastily
he
went
into
the
shed
it
was
already
dark
and
pierre
could
not
make
out
what
the
expression
on
prince
andreis
face
was
whether
it
was
angry
or
tender
pierre
stood
for
a
while
in
silence
considering
whether
to
follow
him
or
go
home
no
he
doesnt
need
it
pierre
decided
to
himself
and
i
know
this
is
the
last
time
well
see
each
other
he
sighed
deeply
and
rode
back
to
gorki
prince
andrei
going
back
into
the
shed
lay
down
on
the
rug
but
could
not
sleep
he
closed
his
eyes
one
image
succeeded
another
he
lingered
long
and
joyfully
over
one
of
them
he
vividly
recalled
one
evening
in
petersburg
natasha
was
telling
him
with
an
animated
excited
face
how
she
had
gone
to
pick
mushrooms
the
previous
summer
and
lost
her
way
in
a
big
forest
she
incoherently
described
to
him
the
dense
forest
and
her
feelings
and
a
talk
with
a
beekeeper
she
met
and
interrupting
herself
every
moment
said
no
i
cant
im
not
telling
it
right
no
you
dont
understand
even
though
prince
andrei
reassured
her
saying
that
he
did
understand
and
indeed
he
understood
everything
she
wanted
to
say
natasha
was
displeased
with
her
own
words
she
sensed
that
she
was
not
conveying
the
passionately
poetic
feeling
which
she
had
experienced
that
day
and
which
she
wanted
to
bring
out
he
was
so
lovely
that
old
man
and
it
was
so
dark
in
the
forestand
he
had
such
a
kindno
i
dont
know
how
to
tell
it
she
said
flushed
and
excited
prince
andrei
now
smiled
the
same
joyful
smile
that
he
had
smiled
then
looking
in
her
eyes
i
understood
her
thought
prince
andrei
i
not
only
understood
her
but
it
was
that
inner
force
that
sincerity
that
inner
openness
that
soul
of
hers
which
was
as
if
bound
by
her
body
it
was
that
soul
that
i
lovedloved
so
strongly
so
happily
and
suddenly
he
remembered
what
his
love
had
ended
with
he
didnt
need
any
of
that
he
saw
none
of
it
and
understood
none
of
it
he
saw
in
her
a
pretty
and
fresh
girl
with
whom
he
did
not
deign
to
join
his
fate
while
iand
to
this
day
hes
alive
and
cheerful
prince
andrei
jumped
up
as
if
someone
had
burned
him
and
again
began
pacing
in
front
of
the
shed
xxvi
on
the
twentyfifth
of
august
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
borodino
m
de
beausset
prefect
of
the
french
emperors
palace
and
colonel
fabvier
came
the
first
from
paris
the
second
from
madrid
to
see
the
emperor
napoleon
in
his
camp
at
valuevo
having
changed
into
court
uniform
m
de
beausset
ordered
the
package
he
had
brought
with
him
carried
to
the
emperor
ahead
of
him
and
entered
the
front
section
of
napoleons
tent
where
while
talking
to
napoleons
adjutants
who
surrounded
him
he
occupied
himself
with
opening
the
box
fabvier
not
going
into
the
tent
stood
talking
with
some
generals
of
his
acquaintance
by
its
entrance
the
emperor
napoleon
had
not
yet
left
his
bedroom
and
was
finishing
his
toilette
snorting
and
grunting
he
turned
now
his
fat
back
now
his
hairy
fat
chest
under
the
brush
with
which
a
valet
was
rubbing
his
body
another
valet
stopping
up
the
vial
with
his
finger
sprayed
eau
de
cologne
over
the
emperors
pampered
body
with
a
gesture
which
said
that
he
alone
could
know
how
much
eau
de
cologne
must
be
sprayed
and
where
napoleons
short
hair
was
wet
and
tousled
on
his
forehead
but
his
face
though
swollen
and
yellow
expressed
physical
pleasure
allez
ferme
allez
toujours
he
repeated
cringing
and
grunting
to
the
valet
rubbing
him
an
adjutant
who
came
into
the
bedroom
to
report
to
the
emperor
how
many
prisoners
had
been
taken
in
yesterdays
action
having
said
what
he
had
to
say
stood
by
the
door
waiting
for
permission
to
leave
napoleon
wincing
gave
the
adjutant
a
frowning
look
from
under
his
eyebrows
point
de
prisonniers
he
repeated
the
adjutants
words
ils
se
font
d233molir
tant
pis
pour
larm233e
russe
he
said
allez
toujours
allez
ferme
he
said
hunching
up
and
presenting
his
fat
shoulders
to
the
brush
cest
bien
faites
entrer
monsieur
de
beausset
ainsi
que
fabvier
he
said
to
the
adjutant
nodding
his
head
oui
sire
and
the
adjutant
disappeared
through
the
door
of
the
tent
the
two
valets
quickly
dressed
his
majesty
and
he
in
the
dark
blue
uniform
of
the
guards
with
firm
quick
steps
went
out
to
the
reception
room
just
then
beausset
his
hands
hurrying
was
setting
up
the
present
he
had
brought
from
the
empress
on
two
chairs
facing
the
emperors
entrance
but
the
emperor
dressed
and
came
out
so
unexpectedly
quickly
that
he
did
not
quite
have
time
to
prepare
the
surprise
napoleon
noticed
at
once
what
they
were
doing
and
realized
that
they
were
not
ready
yet
he
did
not
wish
to
deprive
them
of
the
pleasure
of
giving
him
a
surprise
he
pretended
he
did
not
see
mr
beausset
and
called
fabvier
over
to
him
napoleon
listened
frowning
sternly
and
saying
nothing
to
what
fabvier
was
telling
him
about
the
bravery
and
loyalty
of
his
troops
who
fought
at
salamanca
at
the
other
end
of
europe
and
who
had
only
one
thoughtto
be
worthy
of
their
emperor
and
only
one
fearto
displease
him
the
result
of
the
battle
was
lamentable
during
fabviers
account
napoleon
kept
making
ironic
comments
as
if
he
had
never
supposed
that
things
could
go
otherwise
in
his
absence
i
must
make
up
for
that
in
moscow
said
napoleon
192
tant244t
he
added
and
called
for
de
beausset
who
meanwhile
had
had
time
to
prepare
the
surprise
having
set
something
on
chairs
and
covered
that
something
with
a
cloth
de
beausset
bowed
low
with
a
french
courtly
bow
such
as
only
old
servitors
of
the
bourbons
knew
how
to
bow
and
approached
holding
out
an
envelope
napoleon
turned
to
him
cheerfully
and
pulled
his
ear
you
were
quick
about
it
im
very
glad
well
what
is
paris
saying
he
said
suddenly
changing
his
previously
stern
expression
to
a
most
benign
one
sire
tout
paris
regrette
votre
absence
replied
de
beausset
as
he
ought
but
though
napoleon
knew
that
beausset
had
to
say
that
or
something
like
it
though
in
his
moments
of
clarity
he
knew
that
it
was
not
true
he
was
pleased
to
hear
it
from
de
beausset
he
again
honored
him
by
touching
his
ear
je
suis
f226ch233
de
vous
avoir
fait
faire
tant
de
chemin
he
said
sire
je
ne
mattendais
pas
224
moins
qu224
vous
trouver
aux
portes
de
moscou
said
beausset
napoleon
smiled
and
raising
his
head
distractedly
glanced
to
the
right
the
adjutant
glided
up
to
him
with
a
gold
snuffbox
and
held
it
out
napoleon
took
it
yes
its
a
good
chance
for
you
he
said
putting
the
open
snuffbox
to
his
nose
you
like
to
travel
in
three
days
you
will
see
moscow
you
probably
never
expected
to
see
an
asian
capital
youll
have
a
pleasant
journey
beausset
bowed
in
gratitude
for
this
attention
to
his
hitherto
unknown
to
him
inclination
for
travel
ah
whats
this
said
napoleon
noticing
that
the
courtiers
were
all
looking
at
something
covered
by
a
cloth
beausset
with
courtly
adroitness
not
showing
his
back
half
turned
and
withdrew
two
steps
at
the
same
time
snatching
off
the
cover
and
said
a
present
for
your
majesty
from
the
empress
it
was
a
portrait
painted
in
bright
colors
by
g233rard
of
the
boy
born
to
napoleon
and
the
daughter
of
the
austrian
emperor
whom
everyone
for
some
reason
called
the
king
of
rome
a
quite
handsome
curlyheaded
boy
with
a
gaze
resembling
the
gaze
of
christ
in
the
sistine
madonna
was
depicted
playing
bilboquet
the
ball
represented
the
terrestrial
globe
and
the
stick
in
his
other
hand
a
scepter
it
was
not
entirely
clear
precisely
what
the
painter
meant
to
express
by
presenting
the
socalled
king
of
rome
skewering
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
stick
but
the
allegory
to
all
those
who
had
seen
the
picture
in
paris
and
to
napoleon
himself
obviously
seemed
clear
and
quite
pleasing
le
roi
de
rome
he
said
pointing
to
the
portrait
with
a
graceful
gesture
of
the
hand
admirable
with
a
typically
italian
capacity
for
changing
facial
expression
at
will
he
went
up
to
the
portrait
and
assumed
a
look
of
thoughtful
tenderness
he
felt
that
what
he
said
and
did
nowwas
history
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
nowhe
with
his
grandeur
owing
to
which
his
son
played
bilboquet
with
the
terrestrial
globewas
to
show
in
contrast
to
that
grandeur
the
most
simple
fatherly
tenderness
his
eyes
grew
dim
he
moved
glanced
at
a
chair
the
chair
leaped
under
him
and
sat
down
on
it
facing
the
portrait
one
gesture
from
himand
everyone
went
out
on
tiptoe
leaving
the
great
man
alone
with
his
feelings
having
sat
for
a
while
and
touched
with
his
hand
not
knowing
why
himself
the
roughness
of
a
highlight
on
the
portrait
he
stood
up
and
called
back
beausset
and
the
officer
on
duty
he
ordered
the
portrait
taken
out
in
front
of
the
tent
so
as
not
to
deprive
the
old
guards
standing
near
his
tent
of
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
king
of
rome
the
son
and
heir
of
their
adored
sovereign
as
he
expected
while
he
was
having
breakfast
with
mr
beausset
who
was
deemed
worthy
of
that
honor
he
heard
in
front
of
the
tent
the
rapturous
cries
of
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
old
guard
who
came
running
to
the
portrait
vive
lempereur
vive
le
roi
de
rome
vive
lempereur
came
the
rapturous
voices
after
breakfast
napoleon
in
the
presence
of
beausset
dictated
his
order
for
the
army
courte
et
233nergique
said
napoleon
when
he
had
personally
read
over
the
proclamation
written
straight
off
without
corrections
the
order

warriors

the
battle

you
wanted

on
you

with
all
that
is
needed
comfortable
quarters
and
a
speedy

napoleon
repeated
and
having
invited
mr

the
lover
of
travel
for
a
promenade
he
came
out
of
the
tent
to
the
saddled

beausset
replied
to
the
invitation
to
accompany
the
emperor
he
wanted
to
sleep
and
he
did
not
know
how
and
was
afraid
to
ride
on
horseback
but
napoleon
nodded
to
the
traveler
and
beausset
had
to
go
when
napoleon
came
out
of
the
tent
the
cries
of
the
guards
before
his
sons
portrait
became
louder
still
napoleon
frowned
take
him
away
he
said
pointing
to
the
portrait
with
a
gracefully
majestic
gesture
it
is
still
too
early
for
him
to
look
upon
a
field
of
battle
beausset
closing
his
eyes
and
inclining
his
head
sighed
deeply
showing
thereby
how
he
was
able
to
appreciate
and
understand
his
emperors
words
xxvii
the
whole
of
that
day
of
the
twentyfifth
of
august
as
his
historians
say
napoleon
spent
on
horseback
studying
the
terrain
discussing
plans
presented
to
him
by
his
marshals
and
personally
giving
orders
to
his
generals
the
original
line
of
disposition
of
the
russian
troops
along
the
kolocha
had
been
broken
and
that
linenamely
the
russian
left
flankowing
to
the
taking
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
on
the
twentyfourth
had
moved
further
back
that
the
line
was
no
longer
fortified
no
longer
protected
by
the
river
and
before
it
there
was
only
a
more
open
and
level
space
it
was
obvious
to
everyone
military
and
nonmilitary
that
this
the
line
ought
to
be
attacked
by
the
french
it
seemed
that
for
that
there
was
no
need
for
much
reflection
no
need
for
such
consideration
and
botheration
on
the
the
emperor
and
his
marshals
and
no
need
at
all
for
that
especially
superior
quality
known
as
genius
which
people
like
so
much
to
ascribe
to
napoleon
but
the
historians
who
later
described
the
event
and
the
people
who
then
surrounded
napoleon
and
he
himself
thought
otherwise
napoleon
rode
over
the
field
profoundly
studying
the
terrain
nodding
approvingly
to
himself
or
shaking
his
head
mistrustfully
and
without
informing
the
generals
who
surrounded
him
of
that
profound
course
of
thought
which
guided
his
decisions
told
them
only
his
final
conclusions
in
the
form
of
orders
having
listened
to
a
suggestion
of
davout
known
as
the
duke
of
eckm252hl
about
turning
the
russian
left
flank
napoleon
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
do
that
without
explaining
why
there
was
no
need
to
the
suggestion
of
general
compans
who
was
to
attack
the
fl232ches
that
he
lead
his
division
through
the
woods
napoleon
gave
his
consent
though
the
socalled
duke
of
elchingenthat
is
neyallowed
himself
to
observe
that
moving
through
the
woods
was
dangerous
and
might
break
up
the
division
having
examined
the
terrain
in
front
of
the
shevardino
redoubt
napoleon
reflected
for
a
time
in
silence
and
pointed
to
places
on
which
two
batteries
were
to
be
set
up
by
tomorrow
to
go
into
action
against
the
russian
fortifications
and
to
places
next
to
them
where
the
field
artillery
was
to
be
lined
up
after
giving
this
and
other
orders
he
returned
to
his
headquarters
and
the
disposition
of
the
battle
was
drawn
up
at
his
dictation
this
disposition
which
french
historians
speak
of
with
rapture
and
other
historians
with
deep
respect
was
the
following
at
dawn
two
new
batteries
set
up
during
the
night
on
the
plain
occupied

this
disposition
drawn
up
quite
vaguely
and
confusedlyif
one
allows
oneself
to
consider
napoleons
instructions
without
religious
awe
of
his
geniuscontained
four
points
four
instructions
not
one
of
these
instructions
was
or
could
be
carried
out
the
disposition
says
first
that
the
batteries
set
up
at
the
places
chosen
by
napoleon
along
with
the
guns
of
pernety
and
fouch233
lined
up
with
them
one
hundred
and
two
guns
in
all
should
open
fire
and
rain
shells
on
the
russian
fl232ches
and
redoubts
that
could
not
be
done
since
from
the
places
designated
by
napoleon
the
projectiles
did
not
reach
the
russian
works
and
those
one
hundred
and
two
guns
were
shooting
into
the
void
until
the
nearest
commander
contrary
to
napoleons
order
moved
them
forward
the
second
instruction
was
that
poniatowski
heading
towards
the
village
through
the
woods
would
turn
the
left
wing
of
the
russians
that
was
not
and
could
not
be
done
because
poniatowski
heading
for
the
village
through
the
woods
met
tuchkov
there
who
blocked
his
way
and
so
did
not
and
could
not
outflank
the
russian
position
the
third
instruction
general
compans
will
move
through
the
woods
in
order
to
take
the
first
fortification
companss
division
did
not
take
the
first
fortification
but
was
repulsed
because
on
emerging
from
the
woods
it
had
to
form
up
under
canister
shot
something
napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
fourth
the
viceroy
will
take
the
village
borodino
and
cross
its
three
bridges
proceeding
at
the
same
level
as
the
divisions
of
morand
and
g233rard
of
which
it
is
not
said
where
and
when
they
would
move
which
under
his
command
will
head
for
the
redoubt
and
fall
in
with
the
other
troops
of
the
army
as
far
as
one
can
tellif
not
from
this
muddled
sentence
then
from
the
attempts
that
the
viceroy
made
to
carry
out
the
orders
given
himhe
was
to
move
through
borodino
from
the
left
towards
the
redoubt
while
the
divisions
of
morand
and
g233rard
were
to
move
simultaneously
from
the
front
all
that
like
the
other
points
of
the
disposition
was
not
and
could
not
be
carried
out
having
gone
through
borodino
the
viceroy
was
driven
back
on
the
kolocha
and
could
go
no
further
the
divisions
of
morand
and
g233rard
did
not
take
the
redoubt
but
were
repulsed
and
the
redoubt
was
taken
only
at
the
end
of
the
battle
by
the
cavalry
probably
something
unforeseen
by
and
unheardof
for
napoleon
thus
none
of
the
instructions
of
the
disposition
were
or
could
be
carried
out
but
it
was
said
in
the
disposition
that
after
entering
into
combat
in
this
way
orders
will
be
given
in
accordance
with
the
enemys
actions
and
therefore
it
would
seem
that
during
the
battle
napoleon
would
be
giving
all
the
necessary
instructions
but
that
was
not
and
could
not
be
done
because
during
the
whole
time
of
the
battle
napoleon
was
so
far
away
from
it
that
as
it
turned
out
afterwards
the
course
of
the
battle
could
not
be
known
to
him
and
not
one
of
his
instructions
during
the
battle
could
be
carried
out
xxviii
many
historians
say
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
not
won
by
the
french
because
napoleon
had
a
cold
that
if
he
had
not
had
a
cold
his
instructions
before
and
during
the
battle
would
have
been
of
still
greater
genius
and
russia
would
have
perished
et
la

chang233e
for
historians
who
accept
that
russia
was
shaped
by
the
will
of
one
manpeter
the
greatand
that
france
was
turned
from
a
republic
into
an
empire
and
french
troops
went
to
russia
by
the
will
of
one
mannapoleonsuch
an
argument
that
russia
remained
a
power
because
napoleon
had
a
bad
cold
on
the
twentysixth
such
an
argument
for
such
historians
is
inevitably
consistent
if
it
had
depended
on
napoleons
will
whether
or
not
to
fight
the
battle
of
borodino
and
if
it
had
depended
on
his
will
whether
to
give
this
or
that
instruction
then
it
is
obvious
that
a
cold
having
an
influence
on
the
expression
of
his
will
could
have
caused
the
salvation
of
russia
and
therefore
the
valet
who
forgot
to
give
napoleon
his
waterproof
boots
on
the
twentyfourth
was
the
savior
of
russia
by
that
way
of
thinking
this
conclusion
is
indubitableas
indubitable
as
the
conclusion
which
voltaire
drew
jokingly
not
knowing
at
what
himself
when
he
said
that
the
night
of
st
bartholomew
was
the
result
of
charles
ix
having
an
upset
stomach
but
for
people
who
do
not
admit
that
russia
was
shaped
by
the
will
of
one
manpeter
iand
that
the
french
empire
arose
and
the
war
with
russia
began
by
the
will
of
one
mannapoleonthis
argument
seems
not
only
incorrect
unreasonable
but
also
contrary
to
all
human
essence
to
the
question
of
what
constitutes
the
cause
of
historical
events
a
different
answer
presents
itself
which
is
that
the
course
of
world
events
is
predestined
from
on
high
depends
on
the
coincidence
of
all
the
wills
of
the
people
participating
in
those
events
and
that
napoleons
influence
on
the
course
of
those
events
is
only
external
and
fictitious
strange
as
it
may
seem
at
first
glance
to
suggest
that
the
night
of
st
bartholomew
the
order
for
which
was
given
by
charles
ix
did
not
occur
by
his
will
but
that
it
only
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
called
for
it
and
that
the
slaughter
of
eighty
thousand
men
at
borodino
did
not
occur
by
the
will
of
napoleon
though
he
gave
the
orders
for
the
beginning
and
the
course
of
the
battle
but
that
it
only
seemed
to
him
that
he
called
for
itstrange
as
this
suggestion
may
seem
human
dignity
which
tells
me
that
each
of
us
is
if
not
more
then
certainly
no
less
of
a
human
being
than
the
great
napoleon
calls
for
the
allowance
of
this
solution
to
the
problem
and
historical
research
abundantly
confirms
this
suggestion
in
the
battle
of
borodino
napoleon
did
not
shoot
at
anyone
and
did
not
kill
anyone
that
was
all
done
by
the
soldiers
which
means
it
was
not
he
who
killed
people
the
soldiers
of
the
french
army
went
to
kill
russian
soldiers
in
the
battle
of
borodino
not
as
the
result
of
napoleons
orders
but
by
their
own
will
the
whole
armythe
french
the
italians
the
germans
the
poles
hungry
ragged
and
exhausted
by
the
campaignon
seeing
the
army
that
blocked
their
way
to
moscow
felt
that
le
vin
est
tir233
et
quil
faut
le
boire
if
napoleon
had
now
forbidden
them
to
fight
the
russians
they
would
have
killed
him
and
gone
to
fight
the
russians
because
it
was
necessary
for
them
when
they
heard
the
order
of
napoleon
who
in
return
for
their
mutilation
and
death
presented
them
in
consolation
with
the
words
of
posterity
about
their
having
been
at
the
battle
of
moscow
they
cried
vive
lempereur
just
as
they
cried
vive
lempereur
on
seeing
the
depiction
of
the
boy
skewering
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
bilboquet
stick
just
as
they
would
cry
vive
lempereur
to
any
nonsense
that
was
told
them
they
had
nothing
left
to
do
but
cry
vive
lempereur
and
go
to
fight
in
order
to
find
food
and
rest
as
victors
in
moscow
which
meant
it
was
not
as
the
result
of
napoleons
order
that
they
killed
their
own
kind
and
it
was
not
napoleon
who
ordained
the
course
of
the
battle
because
nothing
of
his
disposition
was
carried
out
and
during
the
battle
he
did
not
know
what
was
happening
in
front
of
him
which
meant
also
that
the
way
these
people
were
killing
each
other
occurred
not
by
the
will
of
napoleon
but
went
on
independently
of
him
by
the
will
of
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
took
the
common
action
to
napoleon
it
only
seemed
that
the
whole
thing
happened
by
his
will
and
therefore
the
question
whether
napoleon
had
or
did
not
have
a
cold
is
of
no
greater
interest
to
history
than
the
question
of
the
last
convoy
soldier
having
a
cold
napoleons
cold
on
the
twentysixth
of
august
has
still
less
significance
since
the
evidence
of
writers
that
owing
to
napoleons
cold
his
disposition
and
his
instructions
during
the
battle
were
not
as
good
as
previously
is
totally
incorrect
the
disposition
quoted
above
was
not
at
all
worse
but
even
better
than
all
the
previous
dispositions
by
which
his
battles
had
been
won
his
imaginary
instructions
during
the
battle
were
also
no
worse
than
previous
ones
but
exactly
the
same
as
ever
but
the
disposition
and
the
instructions
seem
worse
than
previous
ones
because
the
battle
of
borodino
was
the
first
that
napoleon
did
not
win
all
the
most
excellent
and
profoundly
conceived
dispositions
and
instructions
seem
very
bad
and
every
military
expert
criticizes
them
with
a
significant
air
when
the
battle
is
not
won
through
them
and
the
worst
dispositions
and
instructions
seem
very
good
and
serious
men
write
whole
volumes
proving
the
merits
of
bad
instructions
when
the
battle
is
won
through
them
the
disposition
drawn
up
by
weyrother
for
the
battle
of
austerlitz
was
the
picture
of
perfection
in
works
of
that
sort
but
all
the
same
it
was
condemned
condemned
for
its
perfection
for
being
excessively
detailed
in
the
battle
of
borodino
napoleon
fulfilled
his
function
as
the
representative
of
power
just
as
well
and
even
better
than
in
other
battles
he
did
nothing
to
harm
the
course
of
the
battle
he
bowed
to
the
more
wellreasoned
opinions
he
caused
no
confusion
did
not
contradict
himself
did
not
get
frightened
and
did
not
run
away
from
the
battlefield
but
with
his
great
tact
and
experience
of
war
calmly
and
worthily
fulfilled
his
role
of
seeming
to
command
xxix
having
returned
from
a
second
preoccupied

the
line
napoleon

memory
of
all
the
minute
details
of
court
relations
he
interested
himself
in
trifles
joked
about
beaussets
love
of
travel
and
chatted
away
casually
as
a
famous
selfassured
surgeon
who
knows
his
job
does
as
he
rolls
up
his
sleeves
and
puts
on
his
apron
while
the
patient
is
being
strapped
to
the
cot
the
whole
matter
is
in
my
hands
and
in
my
head
clearly
and
definitely
when
i
have
to
get
down
to
it
ill
do
it
like
nobody
else
but
now
i
can
joke
and
the
more
calm
and
jocular
i
am
the
more
assured
calm
and
astonished
at
my
genius
you
should
be
having
finished
his
second
glass
of
punch
napoleon
went
to
rest
before
the
serious
business
which
as
it
seemed
to
him
faced
him
the
next
day
he
was
so
concerned
with
the
business
facing
him
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
despite
his
cold
aggravated
by
the
evening
dampness
at
three
oclock
that
night
loudly
blowing
his
nose
he
went
out
to
the
large
section
of
the
tent
he
asked
if
the
russians
were
still
there
the
reply
was
that
the
enemys
fires
were
still
in
the
same
places
he
nodded
his
head
approvingly
the
adjutant
on
duty
came
into
the
tent

his

koutouzoff
said
napoleon
well
see
remember
he
was
in
command
of
the
army
in
braunau
and
in
three
weeks
never
once
got
on
a
horse
to
inspect
the
fortifications
well
see
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
only
four
oclock
he
did
not
want
to
sleep
the
punch
was
finished
and
there
was
still
nothing
to
do
he
stood
up
paced
back
and
forth
put
on
a
warm
tunic
and
a
hat
and
left
the
tent
the
night
was
dark
and
damp
a
barely
perceptible
dampness
fell
from
above
low
fires
burned
nearby
among
the
french
guards
and
glimmered
far
off
through
the
smoke
along
the
russian
line
it
was
quiet
everywhere
and
one
could
clearly
hear
the
rustling
and
tramping
of
the
french
troops
already
beginning
to
move
and
take
up
their
positions
napoleon
walked
about
in
front
of
his
tent
looked
at
the
fires
listened
to
the
tramping
and
passing
by
a
tall
guard
in
a
shaggy
hat
who
was
standing
watch
by
his
tent
and
like
a
black
post
drew
himself
to
attention
when
the
emperor
appeared
stopped
in
front
of
him
what
year
did
you
join
the
service
he
asked
with
that
habitual
affectation
of
gruff
and
affectionate
soldierliness
with
which
he
always
addressed
his
men
the
soldier
told
him
ah
un
des

did
your
regiment
get
rice
yes
your
majesty
napoleon
nodded
his
head
and
left
him
at
half
past
five
napoleon
was
riding
on
horseback
to
the
village
of
shevardino
it
was
beginning
to
grow
light
the
sky
cleared
only
one
cloud
lay
in
the
east
the
abandoned
campfires
were
going
out
in
the
faint
light
of
morning
to
the
right
a
dense
solitary
cannon
shot
rang
out
raced
by
and
died
away
amidst
the
general
silence
several
minutes
passed
a
second
a
third
shot
rang
out
the
air
shook
a
fourth
a
fifth
rang
out
nearby
and
solemnly
somewhere
to
the
right
the
sound
of
the
first
shots
still
hung
in
the
air
when
others
rang
out
more
and
more
merging
and
interrupting
each
other
napoleon
and
his
suite
rode
up
to
the
shevardino
redoubt
and
dismounted
the
game
had
begun

on
returning
to
gorki
from
seeing
prince
andrei
pierre
having
told
his
groom
to
prepare
the
horses
and
awaken
him
early
in
the
morning
fell
asleep
at
once
behind
the
partition
in
a
corner
that
boris
had
given
up
to
him
by
the
time
pierre
fully
awoke
the
next
morning
there
was
no
one
in
the
cottage
the
panes
were
rattling
in
the
little
windows
the
groom
was
standing
there
trying
to
rouse
him
your
excellency
your
excellency
your
excellency
the
groom
muttered
insistently
without
looking
at
pierre
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
and
clearly
having
lost
all
hope
of
waking
him
up
what
its
begun
its
time
said
pierre
now
awake
listen
to
the
shooting
if
you
please
said
the
groom
a
retired
soldier
all
the
gentlemen
are
gone
and
his
serenity
rode
by
long
ago
pierre
hurriedly
dressed
and
ran
out
to
the
porch
outside
it
was
clear
fresh
dewy
and
cheerful
the
sun
having
just
burst
from
behind
the
cloud
that
had
covered
it
sprayed
its
rays
half
broken
by
the
cloud
across
the
roofs
of
the
street
opposite
over
the
dewcovered
dust
of
the
road
over
the
walls
of
the
houses
the
windows
the
fences
and
pierres
horses
which
were
standing
by
the
cottage
the
roar
of
cannon
was
clearly
heard
outside
an
adjutant
and
a
cossack
trotted
down
the
road
its
time
count
its
time
the
adjutant
called
out
ordering
the
horse
to
be
led
after
him
pierre
went
down
the
road
to
the
barrow
from
which
he
had
looked
over
the
battlefield
the
day
before
there
was
a
crowd
of
military
on
this
barrow
the
french
talk
of
the
staff
officers
could
be
heard
and
kutuzovs
gray
head
could
be
seen
in
its
white
cap
with
the
red
band
and
his
gray
nape
sunk
into
his
shoulders
kutuzov
was
looking
through
a
field
glass
down
the
high
road
in
front
of
him
going
up
the
steps
to
the
barrow
pierre
looked
ahead
of
him
and
froze
in
delight
at
the
beauty
of
the
spectacle
it
was
the
same
panorama
he
had
admired
from
the
barrow
the
day
before
but
now
the
whole
terrain
was
covered
with
troops
and
the
smoke
of
gunfire
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
bright
sun
rising
behind
and
to
the
left
of
pierre
cast
over
it
in
the
clear
morning
air
a
piercing
light
of
a
pink
and
golden
hue
and
long
dark
shadows
the
distant
woods
ending
the
panorama
as
if
carved
from
some
precious
yellowgreen
stone
displayed
the
curved
line
of
its
treetops
on
the
horizon
and
between
them
beyond
valuevo
cut
the
smolensk
high
road
all
covered
with
troops
golden
fields

to
the

could
be
seen
it
was
all
lively
majestic
and
unexpected
but
what
struck
pierre
most
of
all
was
the
sight
of
the
battlefield
itself
borodino
and
the
hollows
above
the
kolocha
on
both
sides
of
it
above
the
kolocha
in
borodino
and
on
both
sides
of
it
especially
the
left
where
the
voyna
between
its
swampy
banks
flows
into
the
kolocha
hung
that
mist
which
melts
dissolves
and
turns
translucent
in
the
bright
sun
and
magically
colors
and
outlines
everything
that
shows
through
it
this
mist
merged
with
the
smoke
of
gunfire
and
everywhere
over
this
mist
and
smoke
gleams
of
morning
light
flashedon
the
water
on
the
dew
on
the
bayonets
of
the
soldiers
who
crowded
along
the
banks
and
in
borodino
through
this
mist
the
white
church
could
be
seen
and
here
and
there
the
roofs
of
borodino
cottages
here
and
there
solid
masses
of
soldiers
here
and
there
green
caissons
and
cannon
and
all
this
was
moving
or
seemed
to
be
moving
because
of
the
mist
and
smoke
spreading
over
the
entire
expanse
as
in
this
hollow
terrain
near
borodino
covered
with
mist
so
outside
it
higher
and
especially
to
the
left
along
the
whole
line
over
the
woods
over
the
fields
in
the
hollows
up
on
the
heights
puffs
of
cannon
smoke
were
ceaselessly
born
of
themselves
out
of
nothing
now
singly
now
in
flocks
now
sparse
now
in
rapid
succession
and
swelling
spreading
billowing
merging
could
be
seen
over
the
whole
expanse
this
smoke
of
gunfire
and
strange
to
say
the
sound
of
it
made
up
the
chief
beauty
of
the
spectacle
poof
suddenly
a
round
compact
puff
of
smoke
was
seen
a
play
of
purple
gray
and
milky
white
and
booma
second
later
came
the
sound
of
this
smoke
poofpoof
two
puffs
of
smoke
rose
up
jostling
and
merging
and
boomboomcame
sounds
confirming
what
the
eyes
had
seen
pierre
turned
back
to
the
first
puff
of
smoke
which
he
had
left
as
a
round
compact
ball
and
in
its
place
there
were
already
balloons
of
smoke
drawing
to
one
side
and
poofwith
a
pause
poofpoofanother
three
another
four
were
born
and
to
each
with
the
same
intervals
boomboomboomboom
came
the
beautiful
firm
sure
sounds
in
response
it
seemed
that
these
puffs
of
smoke
now
raced
along
now
stood
still
and
past
them
raced
woods
fields
and
gleaming
bayonets
on
the
left
side
over
the
fields
and
bushes
these
big
puffs
of
smoke
with
their
solemn
echoes
were
ceaselessly
being
born
and
still
closer
over
hollows
and
woods
burst
out
the
small
puffs
of
musket
smoke
having
no
time
to
become
round
and
in
the
same
way
gave
their
own
little
echoes
trattatatat
rattled
the
muskets
rapidly
but
irregularly
and
meagerly
in
comparison
with
the
firing
of
the
ordnance
pierre
wanted
to
be
there
where
those
puffs
of
smoke
those
gleaming
bayonets
and
cannons
those
movements
those
sounds
were
he
turned
to
look
at
kutuzov
and
his
suite
so
as
to
compare
his
impressions
with
those
of
others
everyone
was
looking
ahead
at
the
battlefield
as
he
was
and
it
seemed
to
him
with
the
same
feeling
on
all
faces
there
now
shone
that
hidden
warmth
chaleur
latente
of
feeling
which
pierre
had
noticed
the
day
before
and
which
he
had
understood
perfectly
after
his
conversation
with
prince
andrei
go
dear
boy
go
christ
be
with
you
kutuzov
was
saying
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
battlefield
to
a
general
standing
next
to
him
having
heard
the
order
this
general
walked
past
pierre
to
the
path
down
from
the
barrow
to
the
crossing
the
general
said
coldly
and
sternly
in
reply
when
one
of
the
staff
officers
asked
where
he
was
going
so
am
i
so
am
i
thought
pierre
and
he
went
in
the
same
direction
after
the
general
the
general
was
getting
on
his
horse
brought
him
by
a
cossack
pierre
went
over
to
his
groom
who
was
holding
the
horses
asking
which
was
the
quieter
pierre
climbed
onto
the
horse
clutched
at
its
mane
pressed
the
heels
of
his
splayed
feet
to
the
horses
belly
and
feeling
that
his
spectacles
were
falling
off
and
that
he
could
not
let
go
of
the
mane
and
the
reins
galloped
after
the
general
provoking
smiles
from
the
staff
officers
who
were
watching
him
from
the
barrow
xxxi
the
general
whom
pierre
was
galloping
after
having
gone
down
the
hill
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
pierre
losing
sight
of
him
rode
into
the
ranks
of
some
infantry
who
were
marching
ahead
of
him
he
tried
to
get
out
of
them
to
the
right
to
the
left
but
everywhere
there
were
soldiers
with
equally
preoccupied
faces
busy
with
some
invisible
but
obviously
important
matters
they
all
looked
with
equally
displeased
and
questioning
eyes
at
this
fat
man
in
a
white
hat
who
for
some
unknown
reason
was
trampling
them
with
his
horse
why
go
riding
into
the
middle
of
a
battalion
one
cried
to
him
another
shoved
his
horse
with
the
butt
of
his
musket
and
pierre
clinging
to
the
pommel
barely
controlling
the
shying
horse
galloped
out
ahead
of
the
soldiers
where
there
was
more
room
ahead
of
him
was
a
bridge
and
at
the
bridge
more
soldiers
stood
shooting
pierre
rode
up
to
them
without
knowing
it
himself
pierre
had
come
as
far
as
the
bridge
over
the
kolocha
which
was
between
gorki
and
borodino
and
which
the
french
having
taken
borodino
attacked
in
the
first
action
of
the
battle
pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
bridge
ahead
of
him
and
that
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
and
on
the
meadow
among
those
rows
of
mowed
hay
he
had
noticed
the
day
before
soldiers
were
doing
something
in
the
smoke
but
despite
the
incessant
shooting
that
was
going
on
there
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
this
was
precisely
the
field
of
battle
he
did
not
hear
the
sounds
of
the
bullets
whining
on
all
sides
and
of
the
shells
that
flew
over
his
head
did
not
see
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
for
a
long
time
did
not
see
the
dead
and
wounded
though
many
fell
not
far
from
him
with
a
smile
that
never
left
his
face
he
looked
about
him
whats
that
one
doing
riding
in
front
of
the
line
someone
again
cried
to
him
go
left
go
right
they
shouted
at
him
pierre
pulled
to
the
right
and
unexpectedly
ran
into
general
raevskys
adjutant
whom
he
knew
this
adjutant
also
glanced
angrily
at
pierre
was
obviously
about
to
shout
at
him
but
recognizing
him
nodded
his
head
what
are
you
doing
here
he
said
and
rode
on
pierre
feeling
out
of
place
and
having
nothing
to
do
afraid
of
getting
in
someones
way
again
rode
after
the
adjutant
is
it
here
or
what
can
i
come
with
you
he
asked
one
moment
one
moment
replied
the
adjutant
and
riding
up
to
a
fat
colonel
who
was
standing
in
the
meadow
he
said
something
to
him
and
only
then
turned
to
pierre
how
did
you
end
up
here
count
he
said
to
him
with
a
smile
still
curious
yes
yes
said
pierre
but

adjutant
turning
his
horse

riding
on

not
bad
thank

said
the
adjutant
but
on
the
left
flank
with
bagration
its
getting
terribly
hot
really
asked
pierre
wheres

to
the
barrow

there

still
bearable
at
our
battery
said
the
adjutant
are

coming
yes
ill

with
you
said
pierre
looking
around
his
eyes
seeking
his
groom
only
here
for
the
first
time
did
pierre
see
the
wounded
trudging
on
foot
or
carried
on
stretchers
on
the
same
little
meadow
with
the
fragrant
rows
of
hay
over
which
he
had
ridden
the
day
before
across
the
rows
his
head
twisted
awkwardly
a
soldier
lay
motionless
his
shako
fallen
off
why
didnt
they
pick
up
that
one
pierre
began
but
seeing
the
stern
face
of
the
adjutant
who
was
looking
in
the
same
direction
he
fell
silent
pierre
did
not
find
his
groom
and
rode
with
the
adjutant
along
the
hollow
towards
the
raevsky
barrow
pierres
horse
lagged
behind
the
adjutants
and
jolted
him
rhythmically
youre
evidently
not
used
to
riding
horseback
count
asked
the
adjutant
no
its
all
right
but
shes
somehow
bouncing
a
lot
pierre
said
in
perplexity
ehhshes
wounded
said
the
adjutant
in
the
right
foreleg
above
the
knee
must
have
been
a
bullet
congratulations
count
he
said
le
bapt234me
du
feu
having
ridden
in
smoke
through
the
sixth
corps
behind
the
artillery
which
moved
forward
was
firing
deafening
them
with
its
gunfire
they
came
to
a
small
woods
in
the
woods
it
was
cool
quiet
and
smelled
of
autumn
pierre
and
the
adjutant
got
off
their
horses
and
went
up
the
hill
on
foot
is
the
general
here
asked
the
adjutant
coming
to
the
barrow
he
was
just
here
he
rode
off
that
way
they
answered
him
pointing
to
the
right
the
adjutant
looked
at
pierre
as
if
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
now
dont
worry
said
pierre
ill
go
up
on
the
barrow
if
i
may
yes
do
you
can
see
everything
from
there
and
its
not
so
dangerous
ill
come
to
fetch
you
pierre
went
to
the
battery
and
the
adjutant
rode
on
they
saw
no
more
of
each
other
and
much
later
pierre
learned
that
this
adjutant
had
had
his
arm
shot
off
that
day
the
barrow
that
pierre
went
up
on
was
that
famous
place
later
known
to
the
russians
as
the
battery
of
the
barrow
or
the
raevsky
battery
and
to
the
french
as
la
grande
redoute
la
fatale
redoute
la
redoute
du
centre
around
which
tens
of
thousands
of
men
were
brought
down
and
which
the
french
considered
the
most
important
point
of
the
position
this
redoubt
consisted
of
a
barrow
in
which
trenches
had
been
dug
on
three
sides
in
the
area
surrounded
by
the
trenches
stood
ten
cannon
firing
through
openings
in
the
rampart
in
line
with
the
barrow
on
both
sides
cannon
also
stood
firing
steadily
slightly
behind
the
cannon
stood
infantry
going
up
on
this
barrow
pierre
had
no
notion
that
this
place
surrounded
by
small
trenches
where
a
few
cannon
stood
firing
was
the
most
important
place
in
the
battle
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
this
place
precisely
because
he
was
there
was
one
of
the
most
insignificant
places
of
the
battle
having
come
up
onto
the
barrow
pierre
sat
down
at
the
end
of
a
trench
that
surrounded
the
battery
and
with
an
unconsciously
joyful
smile
looked
at
what
was
happening
around
him
now
and
then
pierre
with
the
same
smile
got
up
and
trying
not
to
bother
the
soldiers
who
were
loading
and
rolling
the
guns
and
who
constantly
ran
past
him
with
sacks
and
charges
strolled
around
the
battery
the
cannon
of
this
battery
fired
steadily
one
after
the
other
with
a
deafening
roar
and
covered
the
whole
area
with
powder
smoke
in
contrast
to
the
dread
that
was
felt
among
the
covering
infantrymen
here
at
the
battery
where
a
small
number
of
people
busy
with
their
work
were
restricted
separated
from
the
others
by
a
trenchhere
one
could
feel
a
sort
of
family
animation
the
same
and
common
to
them
all
the
appearance
of
pierres
nonmilitary
figure
in
a
white
hat
struck
these
men
unpleasantly
at
first
the
soldiers
passing
by
him
looked
askance
with
surprise
and
even
fear
at
his
figure
the
senior
artillery
officer
a
tall
longlegged
pockmarked
man
came
up
to
pierre
as
if
in
order
to
check
the
action
of
the
end
cannon
and
glanced
at
him
curiously
a
young
roundfaced
little
officer
still
a
perfect
child
obviously
just
out
of
cadet
school
commanding
quite
diligently
the
two
cannon
entrusted
to
him
addressed
pierre
sternly
allow
me
sir
to
ask
that
you
clear
the
way
he
said
to
him
you
cannot
be
here
the
soldiers
shook
their
heads
disapprovingly
looking
at
pierre
but
when
they
all
became
convinced
that
this
man
in
the
white
hat
not
only
was
not
doing
any
harm
but
either
sat
peaceably
on
the
slope
of
the
ram
with
a
timid
smile
politely
making
way
for
the
soldiers
strolled
around
the
battery
under
fire
as
calmly
as
if
it
were
a
boulevard
the
feeling
of
hostile
perplexity
towards
him
gradually
began
to
turn
into
a
gentle
and
jocular
sympathy
similar
to
what
soldiers
feel
for
their
animalsthe
dogs
cocks
goats
and
animals
generally
that
live
with
military
units
then
the
soldiers
mentally
received
pierre
into
their
family
adopted
him
and
gave
him
a
nickname
our
master
they
nicknamed
him
and
gently
made
fun
of
him
among
themselves
one
cannonball
plowed
up
the
dirt
two
steps
from
pierre
he
looked
around
with
a
smile
brushing
off
the
earth
it
spattered
on
his
clothes
how
is
it
youre
not
afraid
master
really
a
stocky
redmugged
soldier
addressed
pierre
baring
his
strong
white
teeth
are
you
afraid
asked
pierre
what
else
answered
the
soldier
shes
got
no
pity
she
smacks
down
and
guts
spill
out
impossible
not
to
be
afraid
he
said
laughing
several
soldiers
with
cheerful
and
gentle
faces
stopped
near
pierre
it
was
as
if
they
did
not
expect
him
to
talk
like
everybody
else
and
were
glad
of
this
discovery
ours
is
soldierly
business
but
for
a
master
its
amazing
some
master
he
is
to
your
places
cried
the
young
officer
to
the
soldiers
gathered
around
pierre
this
young
officer
was
clearly
carrying
out
his
duties
for
the
first
or
second
time
and
therefore
addressed
both
the
soldiers
and
the
superior
with
special
precision
and
formality
the
rolling
fire
of
cannon
and
muskets
was
growing
more
intense
over
the
field
especially
to
the
left
where
bagrations
fl232ches
were
but
due
to
the
smoke
of
gunfire
in
the
place
where
pierre
was
almost
nothing
could
be
seen
besides
observing
the
familylike
circle
of
men
separated
from
all
the
others
who
were
there
on
the
battery
absorbed
all
pierres
attention
his
first
unconsciously
joyful
excitement
produced
by
the
sight
and
sounds
of
the
battlefield
had
now
been
replaced
especially
after
seeing
the
soldier
lying
solitarily
on
the
field
by
a
different
feeling
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
trench
now
he
observed
the
faces
around
him
by
ten
oclock
some
twenty
men
had
already
been
carried
from
the
battery
two
guns
had
been
smashed
shells
were
hitting
the
battery
more
and
more
often
and
bullets
buzzing
and
whistling
reached
them
from
far
away
but
it
was
as
if
the
men
who
were
on
the
battery
did
not
notice
it
on
all
sides
merry
talk
and
joking
were
heard
a
stuffed
one
a
soldier
cried
at
an
approaching
shell
whistling
as
it
flew
not
here
to
the
infantry
another
added
with
a
laugh
noticing
that
the
shell
had
flown
over
and
hit
the
ranks
of
the
covering
troops
what
a
friend
of
yours
another
soldier
laughed
at
a
muzhik
who
ducked
under
a
flying
cannonball
several
soldiers
gathered
at
the
rampart
gazing
at
what
was
happening
further
ahead
theyve
drawn
in
the
front
line
you
see
theyve
backed
up
they
said
pointing
over
the
rampart
mind
your
own
business
an
old
sergeant
shouted
at
them
if
theyve
backed
up
it
means
theyve
got
business
back
there
and
he
took
one
of
the
soldiers
by
the
shoulder
and
kicked
him
with
his
knee
there
was
laughter
roll
up
the
fifth
gun
a
cry
came
from
one
side
all
at
once
now
together
like
boatmen
merry
cries
were
heard
as
they
changed
cannon
aie
it
almost
knocked
off
our
masters
little
hat
the
redmugged
joker
laughed
at
pierre
showing
his
teeth
ah
clumsy
girl
he
added
reproachfully
to
a
cannonball
that
struck
a
wheel
and
a
mans
leg
well
you
foxes
another
laughed
at
the
crouching
militiamen
who
came
to
the
battery
to
fetch
the
wounded
so
you
dont
like
the
porridge
ah
you
crows
youre
scared
stiff
they
shouted
at
the
militiamen
who
faltered
before
a
soldier
with
a
shotoff
leg
so
it
goes
lad
they
mimicked
the
muzhiks
they
really
dont
like
it
pierre
noticed
how
after
every
cannonball
that
hit
its
mark
after
every
loss
the
general
animation
flared
up
more
as
in
an
approaching
storm
cloud
there
flashed
more
and
more
often
more
and
more
brightly
on
the
faces
of
all
these
men
as
if
in
resistance
to
what
was
happening
the
lightning
of
a
hidden
fire
flaring
up
pierre
did
not
look
ahead
at
the
battlefield
and
was
not
interested
in
knowing
what
was
going
on
there
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
contemplating
this
fire
flaring
up
more
and
more
which
he
felt
it
was
also
flaring
up
in
his
soul
at
ten
oclock
the
infantrymen
who
had
been
in
the
bushes
in
front
of
the
battery
and
along
the
kamenka
river
retreated
from
the
battery
they
could
be
seen
running
back
past
it
carrying
the
wounded
on
muskets
some
general
with
his
suite
came
up
on
the
barrow
and
having
talked
with
the
colonel
glared
angrily
at
pierre
and
went
down
again
ordering
the
covering
infantry
who
stood
behind
the
battery
to
lie
down
so
as
to
be
less
exposed
to
fire
after
that
from
the
ranks
of
infantry
to
the
right
of
the
battery
came
the
sound
of
a
drum
shouts
of
command
and
it
could
be
seen
from
the
battery
that
those
ranks
of
infantry
were
moving
forward
pierre
looked
over
the
rampart
one
face
especially
struck
his
eyes
it
was
the
pale
young
face
of
an
officer
who
was
marching
backwards
carrying
a
lowered
sword
and
glancing
uneasily
over
his
shoulder
the
ranks
of
infantrymen
disappeared
into
the
smoke
their
drawnout
cry
was
heard
and
then
rapid
musket
fire
a
few
moments
later
crowds
of
wounded
and
stretchers
came
back
from
there
projectiles
began
falling
still
more
frequently
on
the
battery
several
men
lay
there
and
were
not
carried
away
the
soldiers
bustled
more
animatedly
around
the
cannon
no
one
paid
any
further
attention
to
pierre
he
was
shouted
at
a
couple
of
times
for
being
in
the
way
the
senior
officer
frowning
moved
from
one
gun
to
another
with
big
quick
strides
the
young
little
officer
still
more
flushed
commanded
the
soldiers
still
more
diligently
the
soldiers
handed
on
charges
turned
loaded
and
did
their
work
with
tense
jauntiness
they
bobbed
as
if
on
springs
as
they
walked
the
storm
cloud
came
near
and
the
fire
whose
flaring
up
pierre
had
been
watching
now
burned
brightly
on
all
faces
he
stood
beside
the
senior
officer
the
young
little
officer
his
hand
to
his
shako
came
running
up
to
the
older
one
i
have
the
honor
to
report
colonel
that
there
are
only
eight
charges
left
do
you
order
us
to
continue
firing
he
asked
canister
shot
the
senior
officer
cried
without
answering
looking
over
the
rampart
suddenly
something
happened
the
little
officer
said
ah
and
curling
up
sat
on
the
ground
like
a
bird
shot
down
in
flight
everything
became
strange
vague
and
bleak
in
pierres
eyes
one
after
another
cannonballs
came
whistling
and
struck
the
breastwork
the
soldiers
the
cannon
pierre
who
previously
had
not
heard
these
sounds
now
heard
nothing
else
to
the
right
side
of
the
battery
soldiers
with
cries
of
hurrah
were
running
not
forward
but
back
as
it
seemed
to
pierre
a
cannonball
struck
the
very
edge
of
the
ram
which
pierre
was
standing
scattering
dirt
and
in
his
eyes
a
black
ball
flashed
and
in
that
same
instant
smacked
into
something
the
militiamen
who
were
just
coming
into
the
battery
ran
back
again
all
canister
shot
cried
the
officer
the
sergeant
ran
up
to
the
senior
officer
and
in
a
frightened
whisper
the
way
a
butler
reports
to
his
master
at
dinner
that
they
have
run
out
of
the
wine
he
requested
said
that
they
had
run
out
of
charges
the
brigands
what
are
they
doing
shouted
the
officer
turning
to
pierre
the
senior
officers
face
was
red
and
sweaty
his
frowning
eyes
flashed
run
to
the
reserves
bring
the
caissons
he
cried
angrily
avoiding
pierre
with
his
glance
and
turning
to
his
soldier
ill
go
said
pierre
the
officer
without
answering
him
walked
off
in
the
other
direction
with
big
strides
hold
your
firewait
he
cried
the
soldier
who
had
been
ordered
to
go
for
the
charges
collided
with
pierre
eh
master
this
is
no
place
for
you
he
said
and
ran
down
pierre
ran
after
the
soldier
avoiding
the
place
where
the
young
little
officer
sat
one
cannonball
a
second
a
third
flew
over
him
landing
in
front
on
the
sides
behind
pierre
went
running
down
where
am
i
going
he
suddenly
tried
to
recall
already
running
up
to
the
green
caissons
he
stopped
undecided
whether
to
go
back
or
go
on
suddenly
a
terrible
shock
threw
him
backwards
onto
the
ground
at
the
same
instant
the
flash
of
a
big
fire
lit
him
up
and
at
the
same
instant
a
deafening
roar
crash
and
whistling
rang
in
his
ears
when
he
came
to
pierre
was
sitting
on
his
behind
his
hands
propped
on
the
ground
the
caisson
he
had
been
closest
to
was
not
there
only
charred
green
boards
and
rags
lay
about
on
the
scorched
grass
and
a
horse
dragging
broken
shafts
trotted
past
him
while
another
just
like
pierre
himself
lay
on
the
ground
and
shrieked
long
and
piercingly
xxxii
forgetting
himself
from
fear
pierre
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
battery
as
the
sole
refuge
from
all
the
horrors
that
surrounded
him
just
as
pierre
was
entering
the
earthworks
he
noticed
that
there
was
no
shooting
to
be
heard
on
the
battery
but
some
people
were
doing
something
there
pierre
had
no
time
to
realize
who
these
people
were
he
saw
the
senior
colonel
lying
back
to
him
on
the
rampart
as
if
studying
something
below
and
saw
one
soldier
he
had
noticed
before
who
tearing
away
from
the
people
who
were
holding
him
by
the
arm
was
shouting
brothersand
he
saw
something
else
strange
but
he
had
no
time
to
realize
that
the
colonel
had
been
killed
that
the
one
shouting
brothers
was
a
prisoner
that
before
his
eyes
another
soldier
was
being
bayoneted
in
the
back
he
had
only
just
run
into
the
earthworks
when
a
gaunt
yellow
man
with
a
sweaty
face
in
a
blue
uniform
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
came
charging
at
him
shouting
something
pierre
instinctively
defending
himself
against
the
shock
because
they
were
running
into
each
other
without
seeing
it
put
his
hands
out
and
seized
the
man
it
was
a
french
officer
by
the
shoulder
with
one
hand
and
by
the
throat
with
the
other
the
officer
letting
go
of
his
sword
seized
pierre
by
the
collar
for
a
few
seconds
the
two
men
looked
with
frightened
eyes
into
their
mutually
alien
faces
and
both
were
perplexed
about
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
were
to
do
am
i
taken
prisoner
or
have
i
taken
him
prisoner
each
of
them
thought
but
evidently
the
french
officer
was
more
inclined
to
the
thought
that
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
because
pierres
strong
hand
moved
by
involuntary
fear
squeezed
his
throat
more
and
more
tightly
the
frenchman
wanted
to
say
something
but
suddenly
a
cannonball
came
whistling
low
and
terrible
just
over
their
heads
and
pierre
fancied
that
the
french
officers
head
had
been
torn
off
he
ducked
so
quickly
pierre
also
ducked
his
head
and
released
his
grip
no
longer
thinking
of
who
had
captured
whom
the
frenchman
ran
back
to
the
battery
and
pierre
ran
down
the
hill
stumbling
over
the
dead
and
wounded
who
it
seemed
to
him
tried
to
catch
him
by
the
legs
but
before
he
got
all
the
way
down
dense
crowds
of
russian
soldiers
appeared
before
him
who
falling
stumbling
and
shouting
ran
merrily
and
stormily
up
to
the
battery
this
was
the
attack
which
ermolov
took
credit
for
saying
that
only
his
courage
and
good
luck
had
made
possible
this
exploit
during
which
he
supposedly
threw
up
onto
the
barrow
some
st
george
crosses
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
french
who
had
taken
the
battery
fled
our
troops
with
shouts
of
hurrah
chased
the
french
so
far
beyond
the
battery
that
it
was
hard
to
stop
them
the
prisoners
were
brought
down
from
the
battery
among
them
a
wounded
french
general
who
was
surrounded
by
officers
crowds
of
wounded
familiar
and
unfamiliar
to
pierre
russian
and
french
with
faces
disfigured
by
suffering
walked
crawled
and
were
carried
on
stretchers
from
the
battery
pierre
went
up
on
the
barrow
where
he
had
spent
more
than
an
hour
and
of
that
family
circle
which
had
taken
him
to
itself
he
found
not
a
single
one
there
were
many
dead
whom
he
did
not
know
but
some
he
recognized
the
young
little
officer
sat
in
the
same
curledup
way
by
the
edge
of
the
rampart
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
redmugged
soldier
was
still
twitching
but
they
did
not
take
him
away
pierre
ran
down
no
now
theyll
stop
it
now
theyll
be
horrified
at
what
theyve
done
he
thought
aimlessly
following
behind
the
crowds
of
stretchers
moving
off
the
battlefield
but
the
sun
veiled
in
smoke
was
still
high
and
ahead
and
especially
to
the
left
near
semyonovskoe
something
seethed
in
the
smoke
and
the
roar
of
gunfire
musketry
and
cannonades
not
only
did
not
abate
but
intensified
to
the
point
of
despair
like
a
straining
man
crying
out
with
his
last
strength
xxxiii
the
main
action
of
the
battle
of
borodino
took
place
over
a
stretch
of
seven
thousand
feet
between
borodino
and
bagrations
fl232ches
outside
that
stretch
on
one
side
there
was
a
show
of
uvarovs
cavalry
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
on
the
other
side
beyond
utitsa
there
was
a
clash
between
poniatowski
and
tuchkov
but
these
were
separate
and
weak
actions
compared
with
what
was
happening
in
the
middle
of
the
battlefield
on
the
field
between
borodino
and
the
fl232ches
by
the
woods
on
a
stretch
open
and
visible
from
both
sides
the
main
action
of
the
battle
took
place
in
the
most
simple
artless
way
the
battle
began
with
a
cannonade
from
both
sides
out
of
several
hundred
guns
then
when
smoke
lay
over
the
whole
field
through
this
smoke
from
the
right
on
the
french
side
the
two
divisions
of
dessaix
and
compans
moved
against
the
fl232ches
and
from
the
left
the
viceroys
regiments
moved
against
borodino
from
the
shevardino
redoubt
where
napoleon
stood
the
fl232ches
were
two
thirds
of
a
mile
away
and
borodino
more
than
a
mile
and
a
third
away
as
the
crow
flies
and
therefore
napoleon
could
not
see
what
was
going
on
there
the
less
so
as
smoke
merging
with
the
mist
covered
the
whole
terrain
the
soldiers
of
dessaixs
division
sent
against
the
fl232ches
could
be
seen
only
until
they
descended
into
the
gully
that
separated
them
from
the
fl232ches
as
soon
as
they
descended
into
the
gully
the
smoke
of
the
cannon
and
musket
fire
on
the
fl232ches
became
so
thick
that
it
obscured
the
whole
ascent
up
the
other
side
of
the
gully
there
were
glimpses
of
something
black
through
the
smokeprobably
menand
an
occasional
gleam
of
bayonets
but
whether
they
were
moving
or
standing
still
whether
they
were
french
or
russian
could
not
be
seen
from
the
shevardino
redoubt
the
sun
rose
brightly
and
its
slanting
rays
struck
napoleon
straight
in
the
face
as
he
looked
at
the
fl232ches
from
under
his
hand
smoke
spread
in
front
of
the
fl232ches
and
now
it
seemed
that
the
smoke
was
moving
now
that
the
troops
were
moving
the
shouts
of
men
were
occasionally
heard
through
the
gunfire
but
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
was
being
done
there
napoleon
standing
on
the
barrow
looked
through
a
field
glass
and
through
the
small
circle
of
the
field
glass
he
saw
smoke
and
people
sometimes
his
own
sometimes
russians
but
when
he
looked
again
with
the
naked
eye
he
could
not
tell
where
what
he
had
seen
was
he
went
down
from
the
barrow
and
began
pacing
in
front
of
it
now
and
then
he
stopped
listened
to
the
gunfire
and
peered
at
the
battlefield
not
only
from
the
place
below
where
he
was
standing
not
only
from
the
barrow
where
some
of
his
generals
now
stood
but
from
the
fl232ches
themselves
on
which
together
or
alternately
there
were
now
russian
now
french
soldiers
dead
wounded
and
alive
frightened
or
panicstricken
it
was
impossible
to
understand
what
was
happening
on
that
place
in
the
course
of
several
hours
on
that
place
amidst
the
incessant
firing
of
muskets
and
cannon
there
appeared
now
only
russian
soldiers
now
only
french
now
infantry
now
cavalry
they
appeared
fell
fired
collided
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
each
other
shouted
and
ran
back
again
from
the
battlefield
the
adjutants
he
had
sent
and
his
marshals
orderlies
constantly
came
galloping
to
napoleon
with
reports
on
the
course
of
events
but
all
these
reports
were
false
both
because
in
the
heat
of
battle
it
is
impossible
to
tell
what
is
going
on
at
a
given
moment
and
because
many
of
the
adjutants
did
not
reach
the
actual
place
of
battle
but
told
what
they
had
heard
from
others
and
also
because
while
an
adjutant
was
riding
the
mile
or
more
that
separated
him
from
napoleon
the
circumstances
changed
and
the
news
he
was
bringing
became
incorrect
thus
an
adjutant
arrived
from
the
viceroy
with
news
that
borodino
had
been
taken
and
the
bridge
over
the
kolocha
was
in
the
hands
of
the
french
the
adjutant
asked
napoleon
if
he
ordered
the
troops
to
cross
it
napoleon
ordered
them
to
form
ranks
on
the
other
side
and
wait
but
not
only
as
napoleon
was
giving
this
order
but
even
as
the
adjutant
was
leaving
borodino
the
bridge
had
already
been
retaken
and
burned
by
the
russians
in
that
same
skirmish
which
pierre
took
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
battle
an
adjutant
came
galloping
from
the
fl232ches
with
a
pale
frightened
face
to
inform
napoleon
that
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
and
that
compans
had
been
wounded
and
davout
killed
but
meanwhile
the
fl232ches
had
been
taken
by
another
section
of
troops
just
as
the
adjutant
was
being
told
that
the
french
had
been
repulsed
and
davout
was
alive
and
only
slightly
bruised
on
the
weight
of
such
unavoidably
false
reports
napoleon
gave
his
instructions
which
either
had
been
carried
out
before
he
even
gave
them
or
were
not
and
could
not
be
carried
out
the
marshals
and
generals
who
were
closer
to
the
battlefield
but
who
like
napoleon
did
not
take
the
battle
itself
but
only
occasionally
rode
into
the
fire
gave
their
own
instructions
and
orders
about
where
to
shoot
and
from
where
and
where
the
cavalry
were
to
ride
and
the
infantry
to
run
without
asking
napoleon
but
even
their
instructions
were
carried
out
as
rarely
and
to
as
small
a
degree
as
napoleons
instructions
for
the
most
part
what
came
out
was
the
opposite
of
what
they
had
ordered
soldiers
who
were
told
to
advance
would
come
under
canister
shot
and
run
back
soldiers
who
were
told
to
stay
where
they
were
suddenly
seeing
the
russians
appear
unexpectedly
before
them
sometimes
ran
back
and
sometimes
rushed
forward
and
the
cavalry
galloped
without
orders
in
pursuit
of
the
fleeing
russians
thus
two
cavalry
regiments
galloped
through
the
semyonovskoe
gully
and
as
soon
as
they
rode
up
the
hill
turned
and
galloped
back
at
top
speed
the
infantrymen
acted
in
the
same
way
sometimes
getting
nowhere
near
where
they
were
told
to
go
all
instructions
about
where
and
when
to
move
cannon
when
to
send
foot
soldiers
to
shoot
when
mounted
soldiers
to
trample
the
russian
footall
these
instructions
were
given
by
the
commanders
closest
to
the
units
in
the
ranks
without
even
asking
ney
davout
and
murat
not
to
mention
napoleon
they
were
not
afraid
of
being
punished
for
nonfulfillment
of
orders
or
for
unauthorized
instructions
because
in
battle
it
is
a
matter
of
what
is
dearest
to
a
manhis
own
lifeand
it
sometimes
seems
that
salvation
lies
in
running
back
sometimes
in
running
forward
and
these
people
finding
themselves
in
the
very
heat
of
battle
acted
in
conformity
with
the
mood
of
the
moment
in
reality
all
these
movements
forward
and
backward
did
nothing
to
alleviate
or
alter
the
situation
of
the
troops
all
their
assaults
and
attacks
on
each
other
caused
almost
no
harm
the
harm
death
and
mutilation
were
caused
by
the
cannonballs
and
bullets
that
flew
everywhere
through
that
space
in
which
these
men
were
rushing
about
as
soon
as
these
men
left
that
space
through
which
the
cannonballs
and
bullets
flew
their
commanders
who
stood
in
the
rear
formed
them
up
established
discipline
and
under
the
effect
of
that
discipline
again
led
them
into
the
zone
of
fire
in
which
under
the
effect
of
the
fear
of
death
they
again
lost
discipline
and
rushed
about
according
to
the
chance
mood
of
the
crowd

but
contrary
to
what
had
invariably
happened
in
all
previous
battles
instead
of
the
expected
news
of
the
enemys
flight
the
orderly

of

came

through

day

napoleon
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
barrow
and
drinking
punch
when

galloped
up
to
him
with
assurances
that
the
russians
would
be
crushed
if

majesty

napoleon
with
stern
astonishment
as
if
failing
to

his
words
and
gazing
at
the
handsome

with
his
long
curled

the

with

not
taking
his

from
his
hat
sighed
deeply
and
galloped
back
to
where
people
were
being
killed
napoleon
stood
up
and
summoning
caulaincourt
and
berthier
began
talking
with
them
about
matters
that
did
not
concern
the
battle
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
which
had
begun
to
interest
napoleon
berthiers
eyes
turned
towards
a
general
with
a
suite
who
was
galloping
towards
the
barrow
on
a
lathered
horse
it
was
belliard
he
dismounted
stepped
quickly
up
to
the
emperor
and
boldly
in
a
loud
voice
began
demonstrating
the
necessity
for
reinforcements
he
swore
on
his
honor
that
the
russians
would
be
destroyed
if
the
emperor
gave
one
more
division
napoleon
heaved
his
shoulders
and
saying
nothing
in
reply
continued
on
his
walk
belliard
began
talking
loudly
and
animatedly
with
the
generals
of
the
suite
who
surrounded
him
youre
all
fired
up
belliard
said
napoleon
coming
to
the
newly
arrived
general
again
its
easy
to
make
mistakes
in
the
heat
of
the
fire
go
and
have
a
look
and
then
come
back
to
me
but
belliard
had
no
time
to
disappear
from
view
before
a
new
messenger
from
the
battlefield
came
galloping
from
the
other
side

said
in
the
tone
of
a
man
vexed
at
being
constantly
bothered

began
the

asks
for

napoleon
said
with
an
angry
gesture
the
adjutant
inclined
his
head
affirmatively
and
began
his
report
but
the
emperor
turned
away
from
him
went
two
steps
stopped
came
back
and
summoned
berthier
we
must
give
them
the
reserves
he
said
spreading
his
arms
slightly
who
should

do

he
addressed
berthier

asked
berthier
who
knew
all
the
divisions

and

by
heart
napoleon
nodded
his
head
affirmatively
the
adjutant
galloped
to
clapar232des
division
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
young
guard
unit
that
was
stationed
behind
the
barrow
started
from
its
place
napoleon
silently
looked
in
that
direction
no
he
turned
suddenly
to
berthier
i

he
said
though
there
was
no
advantage
in
sending
friants
division
instead
of
clapar232des
and
there
was
an
obvious
inconvenience
and
delay
in
stopping
clapar232de
now
and
sending
friant
the
order
was
carried
out
with
precision
napoleon
did
not
see
that
in
relation
to
his
troops
he
was
playing
the
role
of
the
doctor
whose
medications
are
a

role
he
so
correctly
understood
and
disapproved
of
friants
division
like
all
the
others
disappeared
into
the
smoke
of
the
battlefield
from
all
sides
adjutants
continued
to
come
galloping
and
all
of
them
as
if
by
agreement
said
one
and
the
same
thing
they
all
asked
for
reinforcements
they
all
said
that
the
russians
were
holding
their
positions
and
keeping
up
un
feu

before
which
the
french
army
was
melting
away
napoleon
sat
on
his
camp
chair
deep
in
thought
having
grown
hungry
since
morning
m
de
beausset
the
lover
of
travel
came
to
the
emperor
and
ventured
to
suggest
respectfully
that
his
majesty
have
lunch
i
hope
that
i
may
already
congratulate
your
majesty
on
a
victory
he
said
napoleon
said
nothing
and
shook
his
head
negatively
supposing
that
the
negation
referred
to
the
victory
and
not
to
lunch
m
de
beausset
allowed
himself
to
observe
with
playful
respect
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
that
could
interfere
with
taking
lunch
when
it
was
possible
to
do
so
allezvous
napoleon
suddenly
said
gloomily
and
turned
away
a
blissful
smile
of
regret
repentance
and
rapture
lit
up
on
mr
beaussets
face
and
with
gliding
steps
he
went
over
to
the
other
generals
napoleon
was
experiencing
a
painful
feeling
similar
to
that
which
is
always
experienced
by
a
lucky
gambler
who
madly
threw
his
money
about
always
won
and
suddenly
precisely
when
he
has
calculated
all
the
chances
of
the
game
feels
that
the
more
he
thinks
over
his
move
the
more
certain
he
is
to
lose
the
troops
were
the
same
the
generals
were
the
same
there
were
the
same
preparations
the
same
disposition
the
same
proclamation
courte
et
233nergique
he
himself
was
the
same
he
knew
it
he
knew
that
he
was
even
much
more
experienced
and
skillful
now
than
he
was
before
even
the
enemy
was
the
same
as
at
austerlitz
and
friedland
but
the
terrible
swing
of
the
arm
fell
magically
strengthless
all
the
old
methods
which
had
invariably
been
crowned
with
successconcentrating
the
batteries
on
a
single
point
attacking
with
the
reserves
to
break
the
line
attacking
with
les
hommes
de
fer
of
the
cavalryall
these
methods
had
already
been
employed
and
not
only
was
there
no
victory
but
from
all
sides
the
same
news
came
of
killed
and
wounded
generals
of
the
need
for
reinforcements
of
the
impossibility
of
dislodging
the
russians
and
of
disarray
among
the
troops
formerly
after
two
or
three
instructions
two
or
three
phrases
the
marshals
and
adjutants
had
come
galloping
with
congratulations
and
cheerful
faces
had
announced
trophies
of
whole
corps
of
prisoners
des
faisceaux
de
drapeaux
et
daigles
ennemis
of
cannon
and
baggage
trains
and
murat
had
asked
only
for
permission
to
let
the
cavalry
take
the
baggage
trains
it
had
been
that
way
at
lodi
marengo
arcole
jena
austerlitz
wagram
and
so
on
and
so
forth
but
now
something
strange
was
happening
with
his
troops
despite
the
news
of
the
taking
of
the
fl232ches
napoleon
saw
that
this
was
different
quite
different
from
all
his
previous
battles
he
saw
that
the
same
feeling
he
experienced
was
being
experienced
by
all
the
people
around
him
battleseasoned
as
they
were
all
their
faces
were
sad
they
all
avoided
each
others
eyes
beausset
alone
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
what
was
happening
but
napoleon
after
his
long
experience
of
war
knew
very
well
what
it
meant
when
in
the
course
of
eight
hours
after
making
every
effort
the
attacking
army
had
not
won
the
battle
he
knew
that
this
was
almost
a
lost
battle
and
that
the
smallest
chanceat
that
precarious
point
of
indecision
the
battle
had
come
tocould
destroy
him
and
his
troops
when
he
went
through
in
imagination
the
whole
of
this
strange
russian
campaign
in
which
not
a
single
battle
had
been
won
in
which
no
banners
no
cannon
no
corps
of
troops
had
been
taken
in
two
months
when
he
looked
at
the
hidden
sadness
on
the
faces
around
him
and
listened
to
reports
that
the
russians
still
stood
their
grounda
terrible
feeling
like
one
experienced
in
dreams
seized
him
and
all
the
unlucky
chances
that
could
destroy
him
came
to
his
mind
the
russians
could
assault
his
left
wing
could
break
through
his
center
a
stray
cannonball
could
kill
him
it
was
all
possible
in
his
former
battles
he
had
thought
only
of
the
chances
of
success
but
now
he
imagined
a
countless
number
of
unlucky
chances
and
he
expected
them
all
yes
it
was
as
in
a
dream
when
a
man
sees
a
villain
coming
at
him
and
in
his
dream
the
man
swings
and
hits
the
villain
with
terrible
force
which
he
knows
should
destroy
him
and
he
feels
his
arm
fall
strengthless
and
limp
as
a
rag
and
the
terror
of
irresistible
destruction
takes
hold
of
the
helpless
man
the
news
that
the
russians
were
attacking
the
left
flank
of
the
french
army
awakened
this
terror
in
napoleon
he
sat
silently
on
a
camp
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
barrow
his
head
lowered
and
his
elbows
on
his
knees
berthier
came
up
to
him
and
suggested
that
they
ride
along
the
line
to
ascertain
what
position
things
were
in
what
whats
that
you
say
said
napoleon
yes
tell
them
to
bring
my
horse
he
mounted
up
and
rode
to
semyonovskoe
in
the
slowly
dispersing
powder
smoke
over
the
whole
space
through
which
napoleon
was
riding
horses
and
men
lay
in
pools
of
blood
singly
and
in
heaps
never
yet
had
napoleon
or
any
of
his
generals
seen
such
horror
so
many
men
killed
on
such
a
small
space
the
roar
of
guns
which
for
ten
hours
had
never
ceased
to
torment
the
ear
gave
the
spectacle
a
special
significance
like
the
music
in
tableaux
vivants
napoleon
rode
out
to
the
height
of
semyonovskoe
and
saw
ranks
of
men
in
uniforms
of
a
color
his
eyes
were
not
accustomed
to
these
were
russians
the
russians
stood
in
close
ranks
behind
semyonovskoe
and
the
barrow
and
their
guns
roared
and
smoked
without
ceasing
along
their
line
there
was
no
longer
any
battle
there
was
a
continuous
slaughter
which
could
lead
nowhere
either
for
the
russians
or
for
the
french
napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
again
fell
into
that
pensiveness
which
berthier
had
brought
him
out
of
he
could
not
stop
what
was
happening
before
him
and
around
him
which
was
considered
to
be
guided
by
him
and
dependent
upon
him
and
which
for
the
first
time
owing
to
its
unsuccess
appeared
useless
and
terrible
one
of
the
generals
who
rode
up
to
napoleon
allowed
himself
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
send
the
old
guard
into
action
ney
and
berthier
who
stood
near
napoleon
exchanged
glances
and
smiled
contemptuously
at
the
generals
absurd
suggestion
napoleon
lowered
his
head
and
said
nothing
for
a
long
time
192
huit

france

ne

ma
garde
he
said
and
turning
his
horse
rode
back
to
shevardino
xxxv
kutuzov
sat
hanging
his
gray
head
and
his
heavy
body
sagging
on
the
rugcovered
bench
in
the
same
place
where
pierre
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
he
did
not
give
any
instructions
but
only
agreed
or
disagreed
with
what
was
suggested
to
him
yes
yes
do
that
he
replied
to
various
suggestions
yes
yes
go
dear
boy
have
a
look
he
said
now
to
one
of
his
attendants
now
to
another
or
he
said
no
theres
no
need
wed
better
wait
he
listened
to
the
reports
brought
to
him
gave
orders
when
his
subordinates
demanded
it
but
as
he
listened
to
the
reports
it
seemed
that
he
was
not
interested
in
the
meaning
of
the
words
being
said
to
him
but
that
something
else
in
the
expression
of
the
face
in
the
tone
of
the
reporters
speech
interested
him
by
many
years
of
military
experience
he
knew
and
by
his
old
mans
mind
he
understood
that
one
man
cannot
lead
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
struggling
with
death
and
he
knew
that
the
fate
of
a
battle
is
decided
not
by
the
commander
in
chiefs
instructions
not
by
the
position
of
the
troops
not
by
the
number
of
cannon
or
of
people
killed
but
by
that
elusive
force
known
as
the
spirit
of
the
troops
and
he
watched
this
force
and
guided
it
as
far
as
that
lay
in
his
power
the
general
expression
of
kutuzovs
face
was
one
of
concentrated
calm
attention
and
a
strain
that
barely
overcame
the
weariness
of
a
weak
and
old
body
at
eleven
oclock
in
the
morning
he
was
brought
news
that
the
fl232ches
occupied
by
the
french
had
been
retaken
but
that
prince
bagration
had
been
wounded
kutuzov
said
ah
and
shook
his
head
ride
to
prince
pyotr
ivanovich
and
find
out
what
and
how
in
detail
he
said
to
one
of
his
adjutants
and
then
turned
to
the
duke
of
w252rttemberg
who
was
standing
behind
him
may
i
ask
your
highness
to
accept
command
of
the
first
army
soon
after
the
dukes
departure
so
soon
that
he
could
not
yet
have
reached
semyonovskoe
the
dukes
adjutant
came
back
from
him
and
reported
to
his
serenity
that
the
duke
requested
more
troops
kutuzov
winced
and
sent
an
order
to
dokhturov
to
assume
command
of
the
first
army
and
asked
the
duke
to
come
back
saying
he
could
not
do
without
him
in
these
important
moments
when
news
was
brought
that
murat
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
the
staff
officers
congratulated
kutuzov
he
smiled
wait
gentlemen
he
said
the
battle
is
won
and
the
capture
of
murat
is
nothing
extraordinary
but
wed
better
wait
before
we
rejoice
however
he
sent
an
adjutant
to
spread
this
news
among
the
troops
when
shcherbinin
came
galloping
from
the
left
flank
with
a
report
that
the
french
had
taken
the
fl232ches
and
semyonovskoe
kutuzov
guessing
by
the
sounds
from
the
battlefield
and
shcherbinins
face
that
the
news
was
bad
got
up
as
if
to
stretch
his
legs
and
taking
shcherbinins
arm
led
him
aside
go
there
dear
boy
he
said
to
ermolov
see
if
anything
can
be
done
kutuzov
was
in
gorki
at
the
center
of
the
russian
armys
position
napoleons
attack
against
our
left
flank
had
been
repulsed
several
times
in
the
center
the
french
had
moved
no
further
than
borodino
on
their
left
flank
uvarovs
cavalry
had
put
the
french
to
flight
after
two
oclock
the
french
attacks
ceased
on
all
the
faces
of
those
who
came
from
the
battlefield
and
of
those
who
stood
around
him
kutuzov
read
an
expression
of
tension
that
had
reached
the
highest
degree
kutuzov
was
pleased
with
the
success
of
the
day
which
was
beyond
expectation
but
the
old
mans
physical
powers
were
failing
him
several
times
his
head
dropped
as
if
falling
and
he
dozed
off
they
served
him
dinner
the
imperial
adjutant
wolzogen
the
same
one
who
riding
past
prince
andrei
had
said
that
war
should
be
im
raum
verlegen
and
whom
bagration
hated
so
much
rode
up
to
kutuzov
during
dinner
wolzogen
came
from
barclay
with
a
report
on
the
course
of
things
on
the
left
flank
the
sensible
barclay
de
tolly
seeing
crowds
of
retreating
wounded
and
the
disorderly
rear
guard
of
the
army
having
weighed
all
the
circumstances
decided
that
the
battle
was
lost
and
sent
his
favorite
to
the
commander
in
chief
with
that
information
kutuzov
was
chewing
roast
chicken
with
difficulty
and
glanced
at
wolzogen
with
narrowed
merry
eyes
wolzogen
stretching
his
legs
casually
with
a
halfcontemptuous
smile
on
his
lips
went
up
to
kutuzov
touching
the
visor
of
his
cap
slightly
wolzogen
treated
his
serenity
with
a
certain
affected
casualness
intended
to
show
that
as
a
highly
educated
military
man
he
left
it
to
the
russians
to
make
an
idol
of
this
old
useless
man
while
he
knew
whom
he
was
dealing
with
der
alte
herr
as
the
germans
called
kutuzov
in
their
circle
macht
sich
ganz
bequem
thought
wolzogen
and
glancing
sternly
at
the
plates
in
front
of
kutuzov
he
began
to
report
to
the
old
gentleman
the
state
of
things
on
the
left
flank
as
barclay
had
ordered
him
to
do
and
as
he
himself
had
seen
and
understood
it
all
the
points
of
our
position
are
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
they
cannot
be
repulsed
because
there
are
no
troops
they
are
running
away
and
it
is
not
possible
to
stop
them
he
reported
kutuzov
stopped
chewing
and
in
astonishment
as
if
not
understanding
what
he
was
being
told
fixed
his
eyes
on
wolzogen
wolzogen
noticing
the
agitation
des
alten
herrn
said
with
a
smile
i
did
not
consider
it
right
for
me
to
conceal
from
your
serenity
what
i
sawthe
troops
are
in
total
disarray
you
saw
you
saw
kutuzov
shouted
frowning
and
rising
quickly
he
went
up
close
to
wolzogen
howhow
dare
you
he
shouted
making
threatening
gestures
with
his
trembling
hands
and
spluttering
how
dare
you
my
dear
sir
say
that
to
me
you
know
nothing
tell
general
barclay
from
me
that
his
information
is
incorrect
and
that
the
true
course
of
the
battle
is
known
better
to
me
the
commander
in
chief
than
to
him
wolzogen
was
about
to
make
some
objection
but
kutuzov
cut
him
off
the
enemy
has
been
repulsed
on
the
left
and
beaten
on
the
right
flank
if
you
see
so
poorly
my
dear
sir
dont
allow
yourself
to
speak
of
what
you
dont
know
kindly
go
to
general
barclay
and
tell
him
that
i
firmly
intend
to
attack
the
enemy
tomorrow
kutuzov
said
sternly
everyone
fell
silent
and
nothing
was
heard
but
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
puffing
old
general
theyve
been
repulsed
everywhere
for
which
i
thank
god
and
our
brave
army
the
enemy
is
defeated
and
tomorrow
we
will
begin
driving
him
out
of
the
holy
russian
land
said
kutuzov
crossing
himself
and
he
suddenly
choked
from
the
tears
welling
up
in
him
wolzogen
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
twisting
his
lips
silently
stepped
away
surprised
252ber
diese

des
alten

yes
here
he
is
my
hero
said
kutuzov
to
the
stout
handsome
blackhaired
general
who
was
coming
up
onto
the
barrow
at
that
moment
this
was
raevsky
who
had
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
main
point
of
the
field
of
borodino
raevsky
reported
that
the
troops
had
stood
their
ground
firmly
and
that
the
french
no
longer
dared
to
attack
having
heard
him
out
kutuzov
said
in
french

ne
pensez
donc
pas
comme

nous

replied
raevsky

kaisarov
kutuzov
called
his
adjutant
sit
down
and
write
the
order
for
tomorrow
and
you
he
turned
to
another
ride
to
the
line
and
announce
that
tomorrow
we
attack
while
the
conversation
with
raevsky
was
going
on
and
the
order
was
being
dictated
wolzogen
came
back
from
barclay
and
reported
that
general
barclay
de
tolly
would
like
to
have
written
confirmation
of
the
order
given
by
the
field
marshal
kutuzov
without
glancing
at
wolzogen
ordered
the
order
to
be
written
which
on
very
good
grounds
to
avoid
personal
responsibility
the
former
commander
in
chief
wished
to
have
and
by
some
indefinable
mysterious
connection
which
maintains
the
same
mood
through
an
entire
army
which
is
known
as
the
spirit
of
the
army
and
constitutes
the
central
nerve
of
war
kutuzovs
words
his
order
to
fight
the
next
day
were
conveyed
simultaneously
to
all
ends
of
the
army
it
was
far
from
the
same
words
the
same
order
that
passed
through
the
last
links
of
that
chain
there
was
even
no
resemblance
between
the
stories
that
were
passed
on
from
man
to
man
at
different
ends
of
the
army
and
what
kutuzov
had
said
but
the
sense
of
his
words
communicated
itself
everywhere
because
what
kutuzov
had
said
came
not
from
clever
considerations
but
from
the
feeling
that
was
in
the
soul
of
the
commander
in
chief
just
as
it
was
in
the
soul
of
every
russian
man
and
learning
that
we
would
attack
the
enemy
the
next
day
hearing
from
the
high
spheres
of
the
army
the
confirmation
of
what
they
wanted
to
believe
the
exhausted
vacillating
men
were
comforted
and
reassured

fire
towards
two
oclock
the
regiment
having
lost
over
two
hundred
men

was
moved
forward
onto

to
the
space
between

and
the
battery
of

where
thousands
of
men
were
killed
that
day
and
at

between

and

oclock
the
intensely
concentrated
fire
of
several
hundred
enemy
guns
was
directed
without
leaving

with
a
hissing
rapid
whistle
and

as
if

a
respite
there
would
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
all

and

overshot
but
sometimes
several

were
taken
out
of

in
the

minute
and
the

mood
the
men
of
the
regiment
were
all
equally
silent
and
gloomy
talk
was
heard
rarely
among
the
ranks
but
that
talk
would
fall
silent
each
time
they
heard
a
shot
strike
home
and
the
cry
stretcher
most
of
the
time
the
men
of
the
regiment
on
orders
from
their
superiors
sat
on
the
ground
one
taking
off
his
shako
carefully
undid
and
redid
the
gathers
another
crumbling
some
dry
clay
between
his
palms
polished
his
bayonet
a
third
worked
the
leather
and
readjusted
the
buckle
of
his
bandolier
yet
another
carefully
spread
out
his
footcloth
wound
it
up
again
and
put
his
boot
back
on
some
built
little
houses
from
the
clods
of
the
field
or
plaited
little
baskets
out
of
straw
they
all
seemed
fully
immersed
in
these
occupations
when
men
were
wounded
or
killed
when
stretchers
were
carried
past
when
our
troops
retreated
when
large
masses
of
the
enemy
were
seen
through
the
smoke
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
these
circumstances
but
when
the
artillery
or
cavalry
advanced
or
movements
of
our
infantry
could
be
seen
approving
remarks
could
be
heard
on
all
sides
but
the
greatest
attention
was
accorded
to
totally
extraneous
events
which
had
no
relation
to
the
battle
it
was
as
if
the
attention
of
these
morally
exhausted
men
found
rest
in
these
ordinary
everyday
events
an
artillery
battery
was
passing
by
in
front
of
the
regiment
the
outrunner
of
one
of
the
artillery
caissons
stepped
over
a
trace
hey
that
outrunnerput
it
right
itll
falleh
they
dont
see
it
men
shouted
from
the
ranks
all
through
the
regiment
another
time
general
attention
was
drawn
to
a
little
brown
dog
with
a
stiffly
raised
tail
who
coming
from
god
knows
where
trotted
out
in
front
of
the
ranks
with
a
preoccupied
air
and
when
a
cannonball
suddenly
hit
close
by
squealed
and
dashed
off
its
tail
between
its
legs
guffaws
and
squeals
came
from
all
over
the
regiment
but
distractions
of
this
sort
last
only
a
few
minutes
while
the
men
had
been
standing
for
more
than
eight
hours
with
no
food
and
with
nothing
to
do
under
the
relentless
terror
of
death
and
their
pale
and
frowning
faces
grew
more
pale
and
frowning
prince
andrei
frowning
and
pale
like
all
the
men
of
the
regiment
paced
up
and
down
the
meadow
next
to
the
oat
field
from
one
edge
to
the
other
his
hands
behind
his
back
his
head
bowed
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
or
to
order
everything
was
being
done
by
itself
the
dead
were
dragged
back
behind
the
front
line
the
wounded
were
carried
away
the
ranks
closed
up
if
soldiers
ran
off
they
came
hurrying
back
at
once
at
first
prince
andrei
walked
up
and
down
the
ranks
considering
it
his
duty
to
rouse
the
courage
of
the
solders
and
set
them
an
example
but
then
he
realized
that
he
had
nothing
to
teach
them
all
the
forces
of
his
soul
as
of
every
soldier
were
unconsciously
bent
solely
on
keeping
himself
from
contemplating
the
horror
of
the
situation
they
were
in
he
paced
over
the
meadow
dragging
his
feet
scuffing
up
the
grass
and
observing
the
dust
that
covered
his
boots
now
he
took
big
steps
trying
to
get
into
the
footprints
left
on
the
meadow
by
the
mowers
then
he
counted
his
steps
trying
to
reckon
up
how
many
times
he
had
to
go
from
edge
to
edge
to
make
a
mile
then
he
pulled
off
the
flowers
of
the
wormwood
that
grew
along
the
edge
and
rubbed
those
flowers
between
his
palms
sniffing
the
fragrantly
bitter
strong
smell
of
all
his
mental
work
the
day
before
nothing
remained
he
was
not
thinking
about
anything
he
listened
with
a
weary
ear
to
the
same
sounds
distinguishing
the
whistle
of
projectiles
from
the
roar
of
cannon
fire
looked
at
the
familiar
faces
of
the
first
battalion
and
waited
here
it
comesthis
ones
for
us
again
he
thought
listening
to
the
approaching
whistle
of
something
from
the
hidden
zone
of
smoke
one
another
more
a
hit
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
ranks
no
an
overshot
but
that
ones
a
hit
and
he
began
pacing
again
trying
to
take
big
strides
so
as
to
reach
the
edge
in
sixteen
steps
a
whistle
and
a
thud
five
paces
from
him
a
cannonball
dug
up
the
dry
earth
and
disappeared
an
involuntary
chill
ran
down
his
spine
he
glanced
at
the
ranks
again
many
had
probably
been
taken
out
a
large
crowd
gathered
by
the
second
battalion
mr
adjutant
he
shouted
order
them
not
to
crowd
around
the
adjutant
having
carried
out
the
order
was
coming
towards
prince
andrei
from
the
other
side
the
battalion
commander
rode
up
look
out
came
a
soldiers
frightened
cry
and
like
a
little
bird
whistling
over
in
quick
flight
and
alighting
on
the
ground
a
shell
dully
plopped
down
within
two
paces
of
prince
andrei
near
the
battalion
commanders
horse
the
horse
first
of
all
not
asking
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
to
show
fear
snorted
reared
up
nearly
throwing
the
major
and
leaped
aside
the
horses
terror
communicated
itself
to
the
men
get
down
cried
the
voice
of
the
adjutant
throwing
himself
to
the
ground
prince
andrei
stood
undecided
the
shell
was
smoking
spinning
like
a
top
between
him
and
the
prone
adjutant
on
the
border
between
the
field
and
the
meadow
near
a
bush
of
wormwood
can
this
be
death
thought
prince
andrei
gazing
with
completely
new
envious
eyes
at
the
grass
at
the
wormwood
and
at
the
little
stream
of
smoke
curling
up
from
the
spinning
black
ball
i
cant
i
dont
want
to
die
i
love
life
i
love
this
grass
the
earth
the
air
he
was
thinking
all
that
and
at
the
same
time
remembered
that
he
was
being
looked
at
shame
on
you
officer
he
said
to
the
adjutant
what
an
he
did
not
finish
at
one
and
the
same
time
there
was
the
sound
of
an
explosion
a
whistling
of
splinters
as
if
from
a
shattered
window
a
choking
smell
of
powderand
prince
andrei
hurtled
sideways
and
raising
his
arm
fell
on
his
chest
several
officers
ran
to
him
from
the
right
side
of
his
stomach
a
large
stain
of
blood
was
spreading
onto
the
grass
the
summoned
militiamen
stopped
behind
the
officers
prince
andrei
lay
on
his
chest
his
face
lowered
to
the
grass
and
was
breathing
in
heavy
gasps
well
what
are
you
standing
there
for
come
here
the
muzhiks
went
over
and
took
hold
of
him
by
the
shoulders
and
legs
but
he
moaned
pitifully
and
the
muzhiks
exchanging
glances
let
go
of
him
again
pick
him
up
lay
him
out
its
all
the
same
cried
someones
voice
they
took
hold
of
him
again
by
the
shoulders
and
laid
him
on
a
stretcher

ah
my
god
voices
were
heard
among
the
officers
it
whizzed
just
a
hair
away
from
my
ear
said
the
adjutant
the
muzhiks
hoisting
the
stretcher
on
their
shoulders
started
down
the
path
they
had
trodden
to
the
dressing
station

stepehyou
clodhoppers
cried
an
officer
stopping
the
muzhiks
by
the
shoulders
as
they
walked
off
unevenly
jolting
the
stretcher

fyodor

the
muzhik
in

there

the
one

said
joyfully
falling
into
step
your
excellency
eh
prince
timokhin
said
in
a
trembling
voice
running
up
and
looking
into
the
stretcher
prince
andrei
opened
his
eyes
looked
out
from
the
stretcher
into
which
his
head
had
sunk
deeply
at
the
one
who
was
speaking
and
lowered
his
eyelids
again
the
militiamen
brought
prince
andrei
to
the
woods
where
the
carts
stood
and
where
the
dressing
station
was
the
dressing
station
consisted
of
three
tents
with
turnedback
flaps
pitched
at
the
edge
of
a
birch
grove
in
the
birch
grove
stood
carts
and
horses
the
horses
were
eating
oats
from
their
nosebags
and
sparrows
flew
down
to
them
pecking
up
the
spilled
grain
crows
scenting
blood
crowing
impatiently
flew
about
in
the
birches
around
the
tents
over
more
than
five
acres
bloodied
men
lay
sat
or
stood
in
various
clothes
around
the
wounded
with
dejected
attentive
faces
stood
crowds
of
stretcher
bearers
whom
the
officers
in
charge
of
keeping
order
tried
in
vain
to
drive
away
from
the
place
not
heeding
the
officers
the
bearers
stood
leaning
on
the
stretchers
and
as
if
trying
to
comprehend
the
difficult
meaning
of
the
spectacle
looked
intently
at
what
was
going
on
before
them
from
the
tents
came
now
loud
angry
screams
now
a
pitiful
wailing
occasionally
surgeons
assistants
ran
out
to
fetch
water
and
pointed
to
those
who
were
to
be
carried
in
the
wounded
waiting
their
turn
by
the
tents
wheezed
moaned
wept
shouted
cursed
begged
for
vodka
some
were
delirious
as
prince
andrei
was
a
regimental
commander
the
bearers
stepping
among
the
notyettreated
men
brought
him
close
to
one
of
the
tents
and
stopped
waiting
for
orders
prince
andrei
opened
his
eyes
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
around
him
he
remembered
the
meadow
the
wormwood
the
field
the
black
spinning
ball
and
his
passionate
fit
of
love
for
life
two
steps
away
from
him
talking
loudly
and
attracting
general
attention
to
himself
stood
a
tall
handsome
blackhaired
sergeant
leaning
on
a
branch
his
head
bandaged
he
had
bullet
wounds
in
his
head
and
leg
around
him
listening
eagerly
to
his
talk
gathered
a
crowd
of
wounded
and
stretcher
bearers
we
just
pounded
him
out
of
there
he
dropped
everything
we
caught
the
king
himself
the
soldier
shouted
looking
around
him
his
black
inflamed
eyes
glittering
if
only
the
reservers
had
come
just
then
brothers
he
wouldnt
even
have
left
his
name
behind
its
the
truth
im
telling
you
prince
andrei
like
everyone
else
around
the
narrator
looked
at
him
with
shining
eyes
and
experienced
a
comforting
feeling
but
does
it
make
any
difference
now
he
thought
and
what
will
be
there
and
what
has
there
been
here
why
was
i
so
sorry
to
life
there
was
something
in
this
life
that
i
didnt
and
still
dont
understand
xxxvii
one
of
the
doctors
came
out
of
the
tent
in
a
bloody
apron
and
with
small
bloody
hands
in
one
of
which
between
the
thumb
and
the
little
finger
so
as
not
to
stain
it
he
was
holding
a
cigar
this
doctor
raised
his
head
and
began
looking
from
side
to
side
but
over
the
heads
of
the
wounded
he
obviously
wanted
to
rest
a
little
turning
his
head
to
right
and
left
for
some
time
he
sighed
and
lowered
his
eyes
right
now
he
said
to
the
words
of
the
assistant
who
was
pointing
to
prince
andrei
and
ordered
him
brought
into
the
tent
a
murmur
arose
in
the
crowd
of
waiting
wounded
looks
like
in
the
next
world
too
only
the
mastersll
have
it
good
one
said
prince
andrei
was
brought
in
and
laid
on
a
justvacated
table
from
which
an
assistant
was
rinsing
something
prince
andrei
could
not
sort
out
separately
what
was
in
the
tent
the
pitiful
moans
on
all
sides
the
tormenting
pain
in
his
hip
stomach
and
back
distracted
him
everything
he
saw
around
him
merged
for
him
into
a
general
impression
of
bared
bloody
human
flesh
which
seemed
to
fill
this
low
tent
as
several
weeks
ago
on
that
hot
august
day
that
same
flesh
had
filled
the
dirty
pool
on
the
smolensk
road
yes
it
was
the
same
flesh
the
same
chair
224
canon
the
sight
of
which
already
then
as
if
foretelling
the
present
had
filled
him
with
horror
there
were
three
tables
in
the
tent
two
were
occupied
prince
andrei
was
laid
on
the
third
he
was
left
alone
for
a
time
and
he
involuntarily
saw
what
was
taking
place
on
the
other
two
tables
on
the
near
table
sat
a
tartar
probably
a
cossack
judging
by
the
uniform
thrown
down
next
to
him
four
soldiers
were
holding
him
a
doctor
in
spectacles
was
cutting
at
something
in
his
brown
muscular
back
unh
unh
unh
the
tartar
was
as
if
grunting
and
suddenly
lifting
up
his
highcheeked
dark
snubnosed
face
and
baring
his
white
teeth
he
began
to
strain
pull
and
shriek
in
a
piercingly
ringing
drawnout
shriek
on
the
other
table
around
which
many
people
crowded
a
big
sturdy
man
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
curly
hair
its
color
and
the
shape
of
his
head
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
prince
andrei
several
assistants
leaned
their
weight
on
the
mans
chest
and
held
him
down
one
big
sturdy
white
leg
kept
jerking
quickly
and
rhythmically
with
a
feverish
quivering
the
man
sobbed
and
spluttered
convulsively
two
doctorsone
was
pale
and
tremblingwere
silently
doing
something
to
the
mans
other
leg
which
was
red
having
finished
with
the
tartar
over
whom
an
overcoat
was
thrown
the
doctor
in
spectacles
wiping
his
hands
came
up
to
prince
andrei
he
looked
at
prince
andreis
face
and
quickly
turned
away
undress
him
what
are
you
standing
there
for
he
cried
angrily
to
the
assistants
his
very
first
distant
childhood
came
to
prince
andreis
mind
as
the
assistant
his
sleeves
rolled
up
unbuttoned
and
removed
his
clothes
with
hurrying
hands
the
doctor
bent
down
over
the
wound
felt
it
and
sighed
deeply
then
he
made
a
sign
to
someone
and
the
tormenting
pain
inside
his
stomach
made
prince
andrei
lose
consciousness
when
he
came
to
the
shattered
hip
bones
had
been
removed
the
shreds
of
flesh
had
been
cut
off
and
the
wound
had
been
dressed
someone
sprayed
water
in
his
face
as
soon
as
prince
andrei
opened
his
eyes
the
doctor
bent
over
him
silently
kissed
him
on
the
lips
and
hurried
away
after
the
suffering
he
had
endured
prince
andrei
felt
a
bliss
such
as
he
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time
all
the
best
and
happiest
moments
of
his
life
especially
his
most
distant
childhood
when
he
had
been
undressed
and
put
in
his
little
bed
when
the
nanny
had
sung
to
lull
him
to
sleep
when
burying
his
head
in
the
pillows
he
had
felt
happy
in
the
mere
consciousness
of
life
presented
itself
to
his
imagination
not
as
the
past
but
as
a
reality
the
doctors
were
bustling
about
a
wounded
man
the
shape
of
whose
head
seemed
familiar
to
prince
andrei
they
were
lifting
him
and
calming
him
show
meoooh
oh
oooh
his
moaning
broken
by
sobs
was
heard
frightened
and
resigned
to
his
suffering
hearing
those
moans
prince
andrei
wanted
to
weep
whether
it
was
because
he
was
dying
without
glory
or
because
he
was
sorry
to
life
or
from
those
memories
of
longlost
childhood
or
because
he
was
suffering
others
were
suffering
and
this
man
was
moaning
so
pitifully
before
him
he
wanted
to
weep
childlike
kind
almost
joyful
tears
the
wounded
man
was
shown
his
cutoff
leg
in
a
boot
caked
with
blood
oh
oooh
he
sobbed
like
a
woman
the
doctor
who
was
standing
in
front
of
the
wounded
man
screening
his
face
stepped
away
my
god
what
is
this
why
is
he
here
prince
andrei
said
to
himself
in
the
unfortunate
sobbing
exhausted
man
whose
leg
had
just
been
removed
he
recognized
anatole
kuragin
they
were
holding
him
up
in
their
arms
and
offering
him
water
in
a
glass
the
rim
of
which
he
could
not
catch
in
his
trembling
swollen
lips
anatole
was
sobbing
deeply
yes
its
he
yes
this
man
is
closely
and
painfully
connected
with
me
by
something
thought
prince
andrei
not
yet
understanding
clearly
what
he
saw
before
him
what
is
this
mans
connection
with
my
childhood
with
my
life
he
asked
himself
without
finding
an
answer
and
suddenly
a
new
and
unexpected
memory
from
the
world
of
childhood
purity
and
love
came
to
prince
andrei
he
remembered
natasha
as
he
had
seen
her
for

at

ball
in
1810
with
her
slender
neck
and
arms
with
her
frightened
happy
face
ready
for
rapture
and
in
his
soul
love
and
tenderness
for

awakened
stronger
and
more
alive
than
ever
he
now
remembered
the
connection
between
him

was
looking
at
him
dully
through
the
tears
that
filled
his
swollen

a
rapturous
pity
and
love
for
this

could
no

himself
and
he
wept

xxxviii
the
dreadful
sight
of
the
battlefield
covered
with
corpses
and
wounded
combined
with
a
heaviness
of
the
head
and
with
the
news
that
twenty
generals
he
knew
well
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
with
the
awareness
of
the
impotence
of
his
oncestrong
arm
made
an
unexpected
impression
on
napoleon
who
ordinarily
liked
to
survey
the
dead
and
wounded
thereby
testing
his
inner
strength
as
he
thought
on
that
day
the
terrible
sight
of
the
battlefield
overcame
that
inner
strength
in
which
he
placed
his
merit
and
greatness
he
hastily
left
the
battlefield
and
returned
to
the
shevardino
barrow
yellow
bloated
heavy
with
dull
eyes
a
red
nose
and
a
hoarse
voice
he
sat
on
a
camp
chair
involuntarily
listening
to
the
sounds
of
gunfire
and
not
raising
his
eyes
with
sickly
anguish
he
awaited
the
end
of
this
action
of
which
he
considered
himself
the
cause
but
which
he
was
unable
to
stop
personal
human
feeling
for
a
brief
moment
got
the
upper
hand
over
that
artificial
phantom
of
life
which
he
had
served
so
long
he
transferred
to
himself
the
sufferings
and
death
he
had
seen
on
the
battlefield
the
heaviness
in
his
head
and
chest
reminded
him
of
the
possibility
of
his
own
suffering
and
death
at
that
moment
he
wanted
for
himself
neither
moscow
nor
victory
nor
glory
what
more
glory
did
he
need
the
only
thing
he
wished
for
now
was
rest
tranquillity
and
freedom
but
when
he
was
on
the
semyonovskoe
heights
the
artillery
commander
had
suggested
placing
several
batteries
on
those
heights
to
increase
the
fire
on
the
russian
troops
crowding
before
knyazkovo
napoleon
had
agreed
and
ordered
them
to
let
him
know
what
effect
those
batteries
had
an
adjutant
came
riding
to
tell
him
that
on
the
emperors
orders
two
hundred
guns
had
been
turned
on
the
russians
but
the
russians
still
stood
firm
our
fire
takes
them
out
by
whole
ranks
but
they
stand
firm
said
the
adjutant
ils
en
veulent
encore
napoleon
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
sire
said
the
adjutant
who
had
not
caught
what
he
said
ils
en
veulent
encore
napoleon
frowning
rasped
in
a
husky
voice
donnezleuren
and
even
without
his
order
they
were
doing
what
he
wanted
and
he
gave
the
instruction
only
because
he
thought
an
order
was
expected
of
him
and
again
he
was
transferred
to
his
former
artificial
world
of
phantoms
of
some
sort
of
greatness
and
again
as
a
horse
walking
about
a
slanting
treadmill
imagines
it
is
doing
something
for
itself
he
began
to
obediently
fulfill
that
cruel
sad
oppressive
and
inhuman
role
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
and
not
only
for
that
hour
and
day
were
reason
and
conscience
darkened
in
this
man
who
more
than
all
the
other
participants
in
this
affair
bore
upon
himself
the
whole
weight
of
what
was
happening
but
never
to
the
end
of
his
life
was
he
able
to
understand
goodness
or
beauty
or
truth
or
the
meaning
of
his
own
actions
which
were
too
much
the
opposite
of
goodness
and
truth
and
too
far
removed
from
everything
human
for
him
to
be
able
to
grasp
their
meaning
he
could
not
renounce
his
actions
extolled
by
half
the
world
and
therefore
he
had
to
renounce
truth
and
goodness
and
everything
human
not
only
on
that
day
riding
around
the
battlefield
strewn
with
dead
and
mutilated
men
by
his
will
as
he
thought
did
he
looking
at
these
men
count
how
many
russians
there
were
to
one
frenchman
and
deceiving
himself
find
cause
to
rejoice
that
for
every
frenchman
there
were
five
russians
not
only
on
that
day
did
he
write
in
a
letter
to
paris
that
le

because
there
were
fifty
thousand
corpses
on
it
but
also
on
the
island
of
st
helena
in
the
quiet
of
solitude
where
he
said
he
intended
to
devote
his
leisure
to
setting
forth
the
great
deeds
he
had
done

he
imagined
that
the
war
with
russia
had
came
about
by
his
will
and
the
horror
of
what
happened
did
not
strike
his
soul
he
boldly
took
upon
himself
all
responsibility
for
the
event
and
his
darkened
reason
saw
his
justification
in
the
fact
that
among
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
who
perished
there
were
fewer
frenchmen
than
hessians
and
bavarians
xxxix
several
tens
of
thousands
of
men
lay
dead
in
various
positions
and
uniforms
in
the
fields
and
meadows
that
belonged
to
the
davydov
family
and
to
crown
peasants
on
fields
and
meadows
where
for
hundreds
of
years
peasants
of
the
villages
of
borodino
gorki
shevardino
and
semyonovskoe
had
at
the
same
time
gathered
crops
and
pastured
cattle
at
the
dressing
stations
the
grass
and
soil
were
soaked
with
blood
over
the
space
of
three
acres
crowds
of
wounded
and
unwounded
men
of
various
units
with
frightened
faces
trudged
on
the
one
side
back
to
mozhaisk
and
on
the
other
side
back
to
valuevo
other
crowds
exhausted
and
hungry
led
by
their
commanders
moved
forward
still
others
stayed
put
and
went
on
shooting
over
the
whole
field
once
so
gaily
beautiful
with
its
gleaming
bayonets
and
puffs
of
smoke
in
the
morning
sun
there
now
hung
the
murk
of
dampness
and
smoke
and
the
strangely
acidic
smell
of
saltpeter
and
blood
small
clouds
gathered
and
rain
began
to
sprinkle
on
the
dead
the
wounded
the
frightened
and
on
the
exhausted
and
on
the
doubtful
men
it
was
as
if
it
were
saying
enough
enough
men
stop
nowcome
to
your
senses
what
are
you
doing
exhausted
men
on
both
sides
without
food
and
rest
began
alike
to
doubt
whether
they
had
to
go
on
exterminating
each
other
hesitation
was
seen
on
all
faces
and
in
every
soul
alike
the
question
arose
why
for
whom
should
i
kill
and
be
killed
you
kill
whomever
you
like
do
whatever
you
like
but
i
dont
want
any
more
of
it
towards
evening
this
thought
ripened
alike
in
each
mans
soul
at
any
moment
all
these
men
might
become
horrified
at
what
they
were
doing
drop
everything
and
run
away
wherever
their
legs
took
them
but
though
by
the
end
of
the
battle
the
men
felt
all
the
horror
of
their
actions
though
they
would
have
been
glad
to
stop
some
incomprehensible
mysterious
power
still
went
on
governing
them
and
the
artillery
men
sweaty
covered
with
powder
and
blood
reduced
to
one
in
three
though
stumbling
and
gasping
from
fatigue
kept
bringing
charges
loaded
aimed
applied
the
slow
match
and
the
cannonballs
with
the
same
speed
and
cruelty
flew
from
both
sides
and
crushed
human
bodies
flat
and
the
terrible
thing
continued
to
be
accomplished
which
was
accomplished
not
by
the
will
of
men
but
by
the
will
of
him
who
governs
people
and
worlds
anyone
looking
at
the
disordered
rear
of
the
russian
army
would
have
said
that
the
french
needed
to
make
one
more
little
effort
and
the
russian
army
would
have
vanished
and
anyone
looking
at
the
french
rear
would
have
said
that
the
russians
needed
to
make
one
more
little
effort
and
the
french
would
have
perished
but
neither
the
french
nor
the
russians
made
that
effort
and
the
flame
of
battle
slowly
burned
out
the
russians
did
not
make
that
effort
because
it
was
not
they
who
were
attacking
the
french
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
they
merely
stood
on
the
way
to
moscow
shielding
it
and
they
went
on
standing
in
the
same
way
at
the
end
of
the
battle
as
they
had
at
the
beginning
but
even
if
the
goal
of
the
russians
had
consisted
in
bringing
down
the
french
they
could
not
have
made
that
last
effort
because
all
the
russian
troops
were
battered
there
was
not
a
single
army
unit
that
had
not
suffered
in
the
battle
and
the
russians
while
staying
in
their
places
had
lost
half
their
troops
for
the
french
with
the
memory
of
all
the
previous
fifteen
years
of
victories
with
their
confidence
in
napoleons
invincibility
with
the
awareness
that
they
had
taken
the
battlefield
that
they
had
lost
only
a
quarter
of
their
men
and
that
they
still
had
the
intact
twentythousandman
guard
it
would
have
been
easy
to
make
that
effort
the
french
who
had
attacked
the
russian
army
with
the
goal
of
dislodging
it
from
its
position
ought
to
have
made
that
effort
because
as
long
as
the
russians
barred
the
road
to
moscow
as
they
had
done
before
the
battle
the
goal
of
the
french
had
not
been
attained
and
all
their
efforts
and
losses
were
in
vain
but
the
french
did
not
make
that
effort
some
historians
say
that
napoleon
needed
only
to
send
in
his
intact
old
guard
for
the
battle
to
be
won
to
talk
of
what
would
have
happened
if
napoleon
had
sent
in
his
guard
is
the
same
as
talking
about
what
would
happen
if
autumn
became
spring
it
could
not
be
it
is
not
that
napoleon
did
not
send
in
his
guard
because
he
did
not
want
to
but
that
it
could
not
be
done
all
the
generals
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
french
army
knew
that
it
could
not
be
done
because
the
armys
fallen
spirits
did
not
allow
it
it
was
not
napoleon
alone
who
experienced
that
dreamlike
feeling
that
the
terrible
swing
of
the
arm
fell
strengthless
but
all
the
generals
all
the
participating
and
nonparticipating
soldiers
of
the
french
army
after
all
their
experience
of
previous
battles
where
the
enemy
had
fled
after
ten
times
less
effort
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
terror
before
an
enemy
who
having
lost
half
his
army
stood
as
formidably
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
the
moral
strength
of
the
attacking
french
army
was
exhausted
it
was
not
the
sort
of
victory
that
is
determined
by
captured
pieces
of
cloth
on
sticks
known
as
standards
and
by
the
amount
of
ground
the
troops
stood
and
stand
on
but
a
moral
victory
the
sort
that
convinces
the
adversary
of
the
moral
superiority
of
his
enemy
and
of
his
own
impotence
that
was
gained
by
the
russians
at
borodino
the
french
invasion
like
an
enraged
beast
mortally
wounded
as
it
charges
sensed
its
destruction
but
it
could
not
stop
just
as
the
twice
weaker
russian
army
could
not
help
moving
aside
after
the
shove
it
had
been
given
the
french
army
could
still
roll
on
as
far
as
moscow
but
there
with
no
new
efforts
on
the
the
russian
army
it
was
to
perish
bleeding
from
the
mortal
wound
it
had
received
at
borodino
the
direct
consequence
of
the
battle
of
borodino
was
napoleons
causeless
flight
from
moscow
the
return
down
the
old
smolensk
road
the
destruction
of
an
invading
army
of
five
hundred
thousand
men
and
the
destruction
of
napoleonic
france
upon
which
had
been
laid
for
the
first
time
at
borodino
the
hand
of
an
adversary

it
is
from
this
arbitrary
division
of
continuous
movement
into
discrete
units
that
the
greater
human
errors
proceeds
a
wellknown
socalled
sophism
of
the
ancients
posits
that
achilles
can
never
overtake
a
tortoise
that
is
walking
ahead
of
him
even
though
achilles
walks
ten
times
faster
than
the
tortoise
while
achilles
covers
the
distance
that
separates
him
from
the
tortoise
the
tortoise
will
get
ahead
of
him
by
one
tenth
of
that
distance
achilles
covers
that
one
tenth
the
tortoise
gets
ahead
by
one
hundredth
and
so
on
to
infinity
the
ancients
considered
this
problem
insoluble
the
nonsensical
conclusion
that
achilles
will
never
overtake
the
tortoise
resulted
only
from
the
fact
that
discrete
units
of
movement
were
introduced
arbitrarily
while
the
movement
of
both
achilles
and
the
tortoise
was
continuous
by
taking
smaller
and
smaller
units
of
movement
we
only
approach
the
solution
of
the
problem
but
never
reach
it
only
by
allowing
for
an
infinitesimal
quantity
and
the
ascending
progression
from
that
up
to
one
tenth
and
by
taking
the
sum
of
that
geometrical
progression
do
we
arrive
at
the
solution
of
the
problem
a
new
branch
of
mathematics
having
attained
to
the
art
of
dealing
with
infinitesimal
quantities
in
other
more
complex
problems
of
movement
as
well
now
gives
answers
to
questions
that
used
to
seem
insoluble
this
new
branch
of
mathematics
unknown
to
the
ancients
in
examining
questions
of
movement
allows
for
infinitesimal
quantities
that
is
such
as
restore
the
main
condition
of
movement
absolute
continuity
and
thereby
corrects
the
inevitable
error
that
human
reason
cannot
help
committing
when
it
examines
discrete
units
of
movement
instead
of
continuous
movement
the
same
thing
happens
in
the
search
for
the
laws
of
historical
movement
the
movement
of
mankind
proceeding
from
a
countless
number
of
human
wills
occurs
continuously
to
comprehend
the
laws
of
this
movement
is
the
goal
of
history
but
in
order
to
comprehend
the
laws
of
the
continuous
movement
of
the
sum
of
all
individual
wills
human
reason
allows
for
arbitrary
discrete
units
the
first
method
of
history
consists
in
taking
an
arbitrary
series
of
continuous
events
and
examining
it
separately
from
others
whereas
there
is
not
and
cannot
be
a
beginning
to
any
event
but
one
event
always
continuously
follows
another
the
second
method
consists
in
examining
the
actions
of
one
person
a
king
a
commander
as
the
sum
of
individual
wills
whereas
the
sum
of
individual
wills
is
never
expressed
in
the
activity
of
one
historical
person
historical
science
in
its
movement
always
takes
ever
smaller
units
for
examination
and
in
this
way
strives
to
approach
the
truth
but
however
small
the
units
that
history
takes
we
feel
that
allowing
for
a
unit
that
is
separate
from
another
allowing
for
the
beginning
of
some
phenomenon
and
allowing
for
the
notion
that
all
individual
wills
are
expressed
in
the
actions
of
one
historical
person
is
false
in
itself
any
conclusion
of
historical
science
without
the
least
effort
on
the
criticism
falls
a
dust
leaving
nothing
behind
only
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
criticism
selects
as
an
object
for
observation
a
larger
or
smaller
discrete
unit
which
it
always
has
the
right
to
do
because
any
chosen
historical
unit
is
always
arbitrary
only
by
admitting
an
infinitesimal
unit
for
observationa
differential
of
history
that
is
the
uniform
strivings
of
peopleand
attaining
to
the
art
of
integrating
them
taking
the
sums
of
these
infinitesimal
quantities
can
we
hope
to
comprehend
the
laws
of
history
the
first
fifteen
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
europe
present
an
extraordinary
movement
of
millions
of
people
people
abandon
their
usual
occupations
rush
from
one
side
of
europe
to
the
other
plunder
kill
each
other
triumph
and
despair
and
the
whole
course
of
life
is
altered
for
several
years
and
presents
an
intense
movement
which
initially
increases
then
weakens
human
reason
asks
what
was
the
cause
of
this
movement
or
according
to
what
laws
did
it
occur
historians
in
answer
to
this
question
lay
before
us
the
deeds
and
speeches
of
several
dozen
men
in
one
of
the
buildings
in
the
city
of
paris
calling
these
deeds
and
speeches
by
the
name
of
revolution
then
they
give
a
detailed
biography
of
napoleon
and
of
some
persons
sympathetic
or
hostile
to
him
tell
of
the
influence
of
some
of
these
persons
on
others
and
say
here
is
the
origin
of
this
movement
and
here
are
its
laws
but
human
reason
not
only
refuses
to
believe
in
this
explanation
but
says
straight
out
that
this
method
of
explaining
is
incorrect
because
in
this
explanation
a
weaker
phenomenon
is
taken
as
the
cause
of
a
stronger
one
the
sum
of
individual
human
wills
produced
the
revolution
and
napoleon
and
only
the
sum
of
those
wills
endured
them
and
then
destroyed
them
but
every
time
there
were
conquests
there
were
conquerors
every
time
there
were
upheavals
in
the
state
there
were
great
men
says
history
indeed
each
time
conquerors
appeared
there
were
wars
human
reason
replies
but
that
does
not
prove
that
the
conquerors
were
the
cause
of
the
wars
and
that
it
is
possible
to
find
the
laws
of
war
in
the
personal
activity
of
one
man
every
time
i
look
at
my
watch
and
see
the
hand
approaching
ten
i
hear
the
bells
start
to
ring
in
the
neighboring
church
yet
from
the
fact
that
the
bells
start
to
ring
every
time
the
hand
reaches
ten
i
have
no
right
to
conclude
that
the
position
of
the
hand
is
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
bells
every
time
i
see
the
movement
of
a
locomotive
i
hear
a
whistling
sound
i
see
the
opening
of
the
valve
and
the
movement
of
the
wheels
but
i
have
no
right
to
conclude
from
this
that
the
whistling
and
the
movement
of
the
wheels
are
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
peasants
say
that
a
cold
wind
blows
in
late
spring
because
the
leaf
buds
of
the
oak
are
sprouting
and
indeed
a
cold
wind
blows
every
spring
when
the
oak
is
sprouting
but
though
the
cause
of
the
cold
wind
that
blows
as
the
oak
sprouts
is
unknown
to
me
i
cannot
agree
with
the
peasants
about
the
sprouting
of
the
oak
being
the
cause
of
the
cold
wind
if
only
because
the
force
of
the
wind
is
beyond
the
influence
of
the
leaf
buds
i
only
see
the
coincidence
of
conditions
that
occurs
in
every
phenomenon
of
life
and
i
see
that
however
long
and
thoroughly
i
observe
the
hand
of
my
watch
the
valve
and
wheels
of
the
locomotive
and
the
leaf
buds
i
will
not
learn
the
cause
of
the
bells
ringing
the
movement
of
the
train
and
the
spring
wind
for
that
i
must
change
my
point
of
observation
completely
and
study
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
steam
bells
and
the
wind
historical
science
must
do
the
same
and
attempts
at
it
have
already
been
made
to
study
the
laws
of
history
we
must
change
completely
the
object
of
observation
leave
kings
ministers
and
generals
alone
and
study
the
uniform
infinitesimal
elements
that
govern
the
masses
no
one
can
tell
to
what
extent
it
is
given
to
man
to
achieve
in
this
way
an
understanding
of
the
laws
of
history
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
possibility
of
grasping
historical
laws
lies
only
on
this
path
and
that
on
this
path
human
reason
has
not
yet
made
one
millionth
of
those
efforts
the
historians
have
made
in
describing
the
deeds
of
various
kings
commanders
and
ministers
and
in
setting
forth
their
reflections
on
the
occasion
of
those
deeds
ii
the
forces
of
twoandten
european
nations
burst
into
russia
the
russian
army
and
populace
retreat
avoiding
a
confrontation
as
far
as
smolensk
and
from
smolensk
to
borodino
the
french
army
with
an
everincreasing
force
of
momentum
races
on
to
moscow
the
goal
of
its
movement
the
force
of
its
momentum
increases
as
it
nears
its
goal
just
as
the
velocity
of
a
falling
body
increases
as
it
nears
the
earth
behind
are
thousands
of
miles
of
famished
hostile
country
ahead
are
a
few
dozen
miles
separating
it
from
its
goal
every
soldier
of
napoleons
army
feels
that
and
the
invasion
pushes
on
of
itself
by
the
mere
force
of
its
momentum
in
the
russian
army
as
it
retreats
the
spirit
of
hostility
towards
the
enemy
flares
up
more
and
more
as
it
falls
back
it
concentrates
and
increases
at
borodino
a
confrontation
takes
place
neither
army
falls
apart
but
immediately
after
the
confrontation
the
russian
army
retreats
of
necessity
just
as
a
ball
rebounds
of
necessity
after
colliding
with
another
ball
coming
towards
it
at
a
greater
speed
and
also
of
necessity
though
losing
all
its
force
in
the
collision
the
swiftly
rolling
ball
of
the
invasion
rolls
on
for
a
certain
distance
the
russians
retreat
another
eighty
miles
beyond
moscow
the
french
reach
moscow
and
stop
there
during
the
five
weeks
after
that
there
is
not
a
single
battle
the
french
do
not
move
like
a
mortally
wounded
beast
which
losing
blood
licks
its
wounds
they
remain
in
moscow
for
five
weeks
without
undertaking
anything
and
suddenly
with
no
new
cause
flee
back
they
rush
down
the
kaluga
high
road
and
that
after
a
victory
for
the
field
remains
theirs
again
after
maloyaroslavets
without
entering
a
single
serious
battle
flee
still
more
quickly
back
to
smolensk
beyond
smolensk
beyond
vilno
beyond
the
berezina
and
further
on
the
evening
of
the
twentysixth
of
august
both
kutuzov
and
the
whole
russian
army
were
convinced
that
the
battle
of
borodino
had
been
won
kutuzov
wrote
as
much
to
the
sovereign
kutuzov
ordered
preparations
for
a
new
battle
to
finish
off
the
enemy
not
because
he
wanted
to
deceive
anyone
but
because
he
knew
that
the
enemy
was
defeated
just
as
every
participant
in
the
battle
knew
it
but
that
same
evening
and
the
next
day
reports
came
in
one
after
another
about
unheardof
losses
about
the
loss
of
half
the
army
and
a
new
battle
turned
out
to
be
physically
impossible
it
was
impossible
to
offer
battle
when
not
all
the
information
had
been
gathered
when
the
wounded
had
not
been
taken
away
the
charges
had
not
been
replenished
the
dead
had
not
been
counted
new
commanders
had
not
been
appointed
to
replace
those
killed
and
the
men
had
not
had
enough
food
or
sleep
and
at
the
same
time
immediately
after
the
battle
the
next
morning
the
french
army
by
that
impetuous
force
of
movement
now
increased
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
was
of
itself
already
making
for
the
russian
army
kutuzov
had
wanted
to
attack
the
next
day
and
the
whole
army
had
wanted
it
but
in
order
to
attack
the
wish
to
do
so
is
not
enough
what
is
needed
is
the
possibility
of
doing
so
and
that
possibility
was
not
there
it
was
impossible
not
to
retreat
by
one
march
then
it
was
just
as
impossible
not
to
retreat
by
another
and
by
a
third
march
and
finally
on
the
first
of
september
when
the
army
got
as
far
as
moscow
despite
the
strength
of
feeling
that
arose
in
the
ranks
of
the
army
the
force
of
things
demanded
that
those
troops
go
beyond
moscow
and
the
troops
retreated
by
one
last
march
and
surrendered
moscow
to
the
enemy
for
those
people
who
are
accustomed
to
think
that
the
plans
of
wars
and
battles
are
drawn
up
by
the
commanders
just
as
each
of
us
sitting
in
his
study
over
a
map
makes
reflections
on
how
he
would
have
disposed
such
and
such
battles
questions
present
themselves
as
to
why
kutuzov
as
he
retreated
did
not
act
thus
and
so
why
did
he
not
take
up
a
position
before
fili
why
did
he
not
retreat
directly
to
the
kaluga
road
why
did
he
abandon
moscow
and
so
on
people
who
are
accustomed
to
think
that
way
forget
or
do
not
know
those
inevitable
conditions
in
which
the
activity
of
every
commander
in
chief
always
takes
place
the
activity
of
a
commander
does
not
have
the
slightest
resemblance
to
the
activity
we
imagine
to
ourselves
sitting
at
ease
in
our
study
analyzing
some
campaign
on
a
map
with
a
known
number
of
troops
on
one
side
and
the
other
and
on
known
terrain
and
beginning
our
reflections
from
some
certain
moment
a
commander
in
chief
is
never
in
those
conditions
of
the
beginning
of
some
event
in
which
we
always
consider
events
a
commander
in
chief
always
finds
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
shifting
series
of
events
and
in
such
a
way
that
he
is
never
able
at
any
moment
to
ponder
all
the
meaning
of
the
ongoing
event
imperceptibly
moment
by
moment
an
event
is
carved
into
its
meaning
and
at
every
moment
of
this
consistent
ceaseless
carving
of
the
event
a
commander
in
chief
finds
himself
in
the
center
of
a
most
complex
play
of
intrigues
cares
dependency
power
projects
advice
threats
deceptions
finds
himself
constantly
in
the
necessity
of
responding
to
the
countless
number
of
questions
put
to
him
which
always
contradict
each
other
learned
military
men
tell
us
quite
seriously
that
kutuzov
ought
to
have
moved
his
troops
to
the
kaluga
road
long
before
fili
that
someone
had
even
suggested
such
a
plan
but
a
commander
in
chief
especially
at
a
difficult
moment
has
before
him
not
one
plan
but
always
dozens
simultaneously
and
all
these
plans
based
on
strategy
and
tactics
contradict
each
other
the
work
of
the
commander
in
chief
seems
to
be
merely
to
choose
one
of
these
plans
but
he
cannot
even
do
that
events
and
time
do
not
wait
suppose
a
suggestion
is
made
to
move
to
the
kaluga
road
on
the
twentyeighth
but
just
then
an
adjutant
comes
galloping
from
miloradovich
and
asks
whether
they
should
go
into
action
against
the
french
now
or
retreat
an
order
must
be
given
at
once
that
minute
and
the
order
to
retreat
deflects
us
from
the
turnoff
to
the
kaluga
road
after
the
adjutant
a
commissary
comes
asking
where
to
transport
the
food
supplies
and
the
head
of
the
hospitals
asking
where
to
transport
the
wounded
and
a
courier
from
petersburg
brings
a
letter
from
the
sovereign
that
does
not
admit
the
possibility
of
abandoning
moscow
and
the
commanders
rival
the
one
who
tries
to
undermine
him
there
are
always
rivalsnot
one
but
several
suggests
a
new
plan
diametrically
opposed
to
the
plan
of
going
to
the
kaluga
road
and
the
commanders
own
forces
require
sleep
and
fortification
and
a
venerable
general
overlooked
for
a
reward
comes
to
complain
and
the
inhabitants
beg
for
protection
and
an
officer
sent
to
survey
the
terrain
comes
and
reports
the
complete
opposite
of
what
an
officer
sent
out
before
him
had
said
and
a
spy
a
prisoner
and
a
general
who
did
some
reconnoitering
all
describe
the
position
of
the
enemy
army
differently
people
accustomed
to
not
understanding
or
to
forgetting
all
these
unavoidable
conditions
of
the
activity
of
any
commander
in
chief
present
to
us
for
instance
the
position
of
the
army
at
fili
and
in
so
doing
suppose
that
on
the
first
of
september
the
commander
in
chief
could
quite
freely
decide
the
question
of
whether
to
abandon
or
defend
moscow
whereas
with
the
russian
army
positioned
within
three
miles
of
moscow
this
question
could
not
exist
when
then
was
the
question
decided
at
drissa
and
at
smolensk
and
most
palpably
at
shevardino
on
the
twentyfourth
on
the
twentysixth
at
borodino
and
every
day
hour
and
minute
of
our
retreat
from
borodino
to
fili
iii
the
russian
troops
having
retreated
from
borodino
were
camped
at
fili
ermolov
who
had
gone
to
survey
the
position
rode
up
to
the
field
marshal
its
not
possible
to
fight
in
this
position
he
said
kutuzov
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
made
him
repeat
what
he
had
said
when
he
did
kutuzov
held
out
his
hand
to
him
give
me
your
hand
he
said
and
turning
it
so
as
to
feel
the
pulse
he
said
youre
unwell
my
dear
boy
think
what
youre
saying
on
poklonnaya
hill
four
miles
from
the
dorogomilovo
gate
kutuzov
got
out
of
his
carriage
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
side
of
the
road
a
huge
crowd
of
generals
gathered
around
him
count
rastopchin
having
come
from
moscow
joined
them
all
this
brilliant
society
breaking
up
into
several
circles
talked
among
themselves
about
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
position
about
the
situation
of
the
troops
about
the
suggested
plans
about
the
condition
of
moscow
about
military
questions
in
general
everyone
felt
that
though
they
had
not
been
summoned
for
that
though
it
had
not
been
called
that
this
was
a
council
of
war
all
conversations
kept
to
the
area
of
general
questions
if
anyone
reported
or
asked
about
personal
news
he
spoke
of
it
in
a
whisper
and
at
once
went
on
to
general
questions
again
no
jokes
no
laughter
no
smiles
even
could
be
noticed
among
all
these
people
everyone
with
obvious
effort
tried
to
be
equal
to
the
occasion
and
all
the
groups
talking
among
themselves
tried
to
keep
in
proximity
to
the
commander
in
chief
whose
bench
constituted
the
center
of
these
circles
and
spoke
so
that
he
was
able
to
hear
them
the
commander
in
chief
listened
and
occasionally
asked
them
to
repeat
what
had
been
said
around
him
but
did
not
enter
the
conversation
himself
or
express
any
opinion
most
often
having
listened
to
the
conversation
in
some
circle
he
turned
away
with
a
look
of
disappointment
as
if
what
they
were
speaking
about
was
not
at
all
what
he
wished
to
know
one
spoke
of
the
position
chosen
criticizing
not
so
much
the
position
as
the
mental
abilities
of
those
who
had
chosen
it
another
argued
that
the
mistake
had
been
made
before
that
battle
should
have
been
accepted
two
days
earlier
a
third
discussed
the
battle
of
salamanca
which
the
newly
arrived
frenchman
crosart
in
a
spanish
uniform
told
about
this
frenchman
along
with
one
of
the
german
princes
who
served
in
the
russian
army
was
analyzing
the
siege
of
saragossa
anticipating
the
possibility
of
defending
moscow
in
the
same
way
in
a
fourth
circle
count
rastopchin
said
that
he
and
the
moscow
militia
were
ready
to
perish
under
the
walls
of
the
capital
but
even
so
he
could
not
help
regretting
the
uncertainty
in
which
he
had
been
left
and
had
he
known
it
earlier
things
would
have
been
differenta
fifth
showing
the
profundity
of
its
strategic
reflections
spoke
of
the
direction
the
troops
would
have
to
take
a
sixth
talked
total
nonsense
kutuzovs
face
was
growing
more
and
more
preoccupied
and
sad
from
all
these
conversations
kutuzov
saw
one
thing
the
defense
of
moscow
was
in
no
way
physically
possible
in
the
full
meaning
of
those
words
that
is
impossible
to
such
a
degree
that
if
some
insane
commander
in
chief
gave
the
order
to
offer
battle
confusion
would
set
in
and
there
would
be
no
battle
anyway
there
would
not
be
because
all
the
higher
officers
not
only
acknowledged
that
the
position
was
impossible
but
in
their
conversations
discussed
only
what
would
take
place
after
the
undoubted
abandoning
of
that
position
how
could
the
officers
lead
their
troops
to
a
battlefield
they
considered
impossible
the
lower
officers
even
the
soldiers
who
also
reason
considered
the
position
just
as
impossible
and
therefore
could
not
go
to
fight
in
the
certainty
of
defeat
if
bennigsen
insisted
on
the
defense
of
that
position
and
others
still
discussed
it
the
question
no
longer
had
any
meaning
in
itself
but
only
as
a
pretext
for
argument
and
intrigue
kutuzov
understood
that
bennigsen
having
chosen
the
position
ardently
displaying
his
patriotism
which
kutuzov
could
not
listen
to
without
wincing
insisted
on
defending
moscow
kutuzov
saw
bennigsens
aim
as
clear
as
day
if
the
defense
failed
to
throw
the
blame
on
kutuzov
who
had
led
the
troops
as
far
as
sparrow
hills
without
a
battle
if
it
succeeded
to
ascribe
it
to
himself
in
case
of
refusalto
clear
himself
of
criminally
abandoning
moscow
but
this
question
of
intrigue
did
not
concern
the
old
man
now
one
terrible
question
concerned
him
and
he
heard
no
answer
to
this
question
from
anyone
for
him
the
question
now
consisted
only
in
this
can
it
be
that
i
allowed
napoleon
to
get
as
far
as
moscow
and
when
then
did
i
do
it
when
was
it
decided
was
it
yesterday
when
i
sent
platov
the
order
to
retreat
or
was
it
the
evening
before
when
i
dozed
off
and
told
bennigsen
to
give
the
orders
or
still
earlierbut
when
when
was
this
terrible
matter
decided
moscow
must
be
abandoned
the
troops
must
retreat
and
the
order
has
to
be
given
to
give
this
terrible
order
seemed
to
him
the
same
as
giving
up
command
of
the
army
and
it
was
not
just
that
he
loved
power
and
was
used
to
it
the
honors
given
to
prince
prozorovsky
to
whom
he
had
been
attached
in
turkey
piqued
him
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
destined
to
save
russia
and
only
because
of
that
against
the
will
of
the
sovereign
and
by
the
will
of
the
people
was
he
chosen
commander
in
chief
he
was
convinced
that
he
alone
in
those
difficult
circumstances
could
maintain
himself
at
the
head
of
the
army
and
that
he
alone
in
the
whole
world
was
capable
of
knowing
without
dread
that
his
adversary
was
the
invincible
napoleon
and
he
dreaded
the
thought
of
the
order
he
had
to
give
but
he
had
to
decide
something
had
to
stop
these
conversations
around
him
which
were
beginning
to
take
on
too
free
a
character
he
called
the
senior
generals
to
him
ma

he
said
getting
up
from
the
bench
and
riding
to
fili
where
his
carriages
were
waiting
iv
in
the
spacious
better
side
of
the
muzhik
andrei
savostyanovs
cottage
a
council
gathered
at
two
oclock
the
men
women
and
children
of
the
large
peasant
family
crowded
into
the
kitchen
side
across
the
front
hall
only
andreis
granddaughter
malasha
a
sixyearold
girl
whom
his
serenity
caressed
and
gave
a
lump
of
sugar
at
tea
stayed
on
the
stove
in
the
big
side
malasha
looked
down
timidly
and
joyfully
from
the
stove
on
the
faces
uniforms
and
crosses
of
the
generals
who
came
into
the
cottage
one
after
another
and
sat
down
in
the
best
corner
on
wide
benches
under
the
icons
grandpa
himself
as
malasha
mentally
called
kutuzov
sat
a
them
in
a
dark
corner
behind
the
stove
he
sat
deeply
immersed
in
a
folding
armchair
constantly
groaning
and
spreading
the
collar
of
his
tunic
which
though
unbuttoned
still
seemed
to
chafe
his
neck
the
entering
men
went
up
to
the
field
marshal
one
after
another
he
shook
hands
with
some
nodded
to
others
the
adjutant
kaisarov
was
about
to
pull
open
the
curtain
on
the
window
opposite
kutuzov
but
kutuzov
waved
his
hand
crossly
and
kaisarov
understood
that
his
serenity
did
not
want
people
to
see
his
face
there
were
so
many
people
gathered
around
the
peasant
pine
table
on
which
lay
maps
plans
pencils
and
papers
that
the
orderlies
brought
another
bench
and
set
it
down
at
the
table
on
this
bench
sat
the
already
arrived
ermolov
kaisarov
and
toll
just
under
the
icons
in
the
foremost
place
a
st
george
on
his
neck
with
a
pale
sickly
face
and
with
his
high
forehead
merging
into
his
bald
head
sat
barclay
de
tolly
it
was
the
second
day
that
he
had
been
suffering
from
a
fever
and
just
then
he
had
chills
and
cramps
next
to
him
sat
uvarov
who
in
a
low
voice
as
they
all
spoke
was
telling
barclay
something
gesticulating
rapidly
the
small
round
dokhturov
with
raised
eyebrows
listened
attentively
his
hands
folded
on
his
stomach
on
the
other
side
his
broad
head
with
its
bold
features
and
shining
eyes
propped
on
his
hand
sat
count
ostermanntolstoy
who
seemed
to
be
immersed
in
his
own
thoughts
raevsky
with
an
impatient
expression
twirling
the
black
hair
on
his
temples
with
a
habitual
gesture
glanced
now
at
kutuzov
now
at
the
door
the
firm
handsome
and
kindly
face
of
konovnitsyn
shone
with
a
tender
and
sly
smile
he
met
malashas
gaze
and
made
signs
to
her
with
his
eyes
that
made
the
girl
smile
they
were
all
waiting
for
bennigsen
who
on
the
pretext
of
making
a
new
survey
of
the
position
was
finishing
his
delicious
dinner
they
waited
for
him
from
four
to
six
oclock
and
all
that
while
did
not
commence
the
deliberations
but
conducted
conversations
in
quiet
voices
only
when
bennigsen
came
into
the
cottage
did
kutuzov
stir
from
his
corner
and
move
towards
the
table
but
only
so
far
so
that
his
face
would
not
be
lit
by
the
candles
that
had
been
placed
on
it
bennigsen
opened
the
council
with
the
question
to
abandon
russias
sacred
and
ancient
capital
without
a
fight
or
to
defend
it
a
long
and
general
silence
ensued
all
faces
frowned
and
in
the
silence
kutuzovs
angry
grunting
and
coughing
could
be
heard
all
eyes
looked
at
him
malasha
also
looked
at
grandpa
she
was
closest
to
him
of
all
and
saw
how
his
face
winced
it
was
as
if
he
was
about
to
cry
but
that
did
not
last
long
russias
sacred
and
ancient
capital
he
suddenly
began
in
an
angry
voice
repeating
bennigsens
words
and
thereby
indicating
the
false
note
in
those
words
allow
me
to
tell
you
your
excellency
that
this
question
has
no
meaning
for
a
russian
he
heaved
his
heavy
body
forward
such
a
question
cannot
be
posed
and
such
a
question
has
no
meaning
the
question
for
which
i
have
asked
these
gentlemen
to
meet
is
a
military
one
the
question
is
this
russias
salvation
lies
in
the
army
is
it
more
advantageous
to
risk
losing
the
army
and
moscow
by
accepting
battle
or
to
surrender
moscow
without
a
battle
that
is
the
question
on
which
i
would
like
to
know
your
opinion
he
heaved
himself
back
in
the
armchair
a
debate
began
bennigsen
still
did
not
consider
the
game
lost
allowing
for
the
opinion
of
barclay
and
others
about
the
impossibility
of
accepting
a
defensive
battle
at
fili
he
imbued
with
russian
patriotism
and
love
for
moscow
suggested
shifting
the
troops
during
the
night
from
the
right
flank
to
the
left
and
striking
at
the
right
wing
of
the
french
the
next
day
opinions
were
divided
there
were
arguments
for
and
against
this
opinion
ermolov
dokhturov
and
raevsky
agreed
with
bennigsens
opinion
whether
guided
by
a
sense
of
the
need
for
sacrifice
before
abandoning
the
capital
or
by
other
more
personal
considerations
these
generals
seemed
not
to
understand
that
the
present
council
could
not
change
the
inevitable
course
of
events
and
that
moscow
had
already
been
abandoned
the
rest
of
the
generals
understood
that
and
leaving
aside
the
question
of
moscow
spoke
of
the
direction
the
army
should
take
in
its
retreat
malasha
who
looked
at
what
was
happening
before
her
without
taking
her
eyes
away
understood
the
meaning
of
this
council
differently
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
a
matter
only
of
a
personal
struggle
between
grandpa
and
longskirts
as
she
called
bennigsen
she
saw
that
they
were
angry
when
they
spoke
to
each
other
and
in
her
heart
she
took
grandpas
side
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
she
noticed
a
sly
glance
that
grandpa
cast
at
bennigsen
and
after
that
to
her
joy
noticed
that
grandpa
had
said
something
to
longskirts
that
took
him
aback
bennigsen
suddenly
turned
red
and
angrily
paced
about
the
cottage
the
words
that
had
so
affected
bennigsen
were
kutuzovs
opinion
expressed
in
a
calm
and
soft
voice
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
bennigsens
suggestion
about
shifting
the
troops
during
the
night
from
the
right
flank
to
the
left
for
an
attack
on
the
french
right
wing
gentlemen
said
kutuzov
i
cannot
approve
of
the
counts
plan
shifting
troops
in
close
proximity
to
the
enemy
is
always
dangerous
and
military
history
confirms
this
consideration
thus
for
example
kutuzov
seemed
to
ponder
searching
for
an
example
and
looked
at
bennigsen
with
a
bright
na239ve
gaze
yes
lets
just
take
the
battle
of
friedland
which
as
i
believe
the
count
remembers
well
wasnot
entirely
successful
only
because
our
troops
were
reformed
in
much
too
close
proximity
to
the
enemy
a
moments
silence
ensued
which
seemed
very
long
to
all
of
them
the
debate
began
again
but
there
were
frequent
pauses
and
the
feeling
was
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
talk
about
during
one
such
pause
kutuzov
sighed
deeply
as
if
he
was
about
to
speak
they
all
turned
to
look
at
him
eh
bien
messieurs
je
vois
que
cest
moi
qui
payerai
les
pots
cass233s
he
said
and
slowly
getting
up
he
went
to
the
table
gentlemen
ive
heard
your
opinions
some
will
disagree
with
me
but
i
he
stopped
by
the
power
entrusted
in
me
by
my
sovereign
and
the
fatherland
iorder
a
retreat
after
that
the
generals
began
to
disperse
with
the
same
solemn
and
silent
discretion
as
people
dispersing
after
a
funeral
some
of
the
generals
in
low
voices
in
quite
a
different
register
than
when
they
were
speaking
at
the
council
conveyed
something
to
the
commander
in
chief
malasha
who
had
long
been
expected
at
supper
carefully
climbed
down
backwards
from
her
stove
shelf
resting
her
bare
little
feet
on
the
ledges
of
the
stove
and
getting
tangled
between
the
legs
of
the
generals
darted
through
the
door
having
dismissed
the
generals
kutuzov
sat
for
a
long
time
his
elbow
leaning
on
the
table
and
thought
about
the
same
terrible
question
when
when
was
it
decided
finally
to
abandon
moscow
when
was
the
thing
done
that
decided
this
question
and
who
is
to
blame
for
it
this
this
i
didnt
expect
he
said
to
the
adjutant
schneider
who
came
into
the
room
when
it
was
already
late
at
night
this
i
didnt
expect
this
never
occurred
to
me
you
must
get
some
rest
your
serenity
said
schneider
but
no
theyll
eat
horseflesh
like
the
turks
kutuzov
shouted
without
replying
banging
the
table
with
his
plump
hand
that
they
will
if
only
v
in
contrast
to
kutuzov
at
that
same
time
in
an
event
still
more
important
than
the
armys
retreat
without
a
battle
in
the
abandoning
and
burning
of
moscow
rastopchin
whom
we
picture
as
the
guiding
hand
of
this
event
acted
quite
differently
this
eventthe
abandoning
and
burning
of
moscowwas
as
inevitable
as
the
armys
retreat
beyond
moscow
without
a
battle
after
the
battle
of
borodino
every
russian
not
on
the
basis
of
reasoning
but
on
the
basis
of
the
feeling
that
is
inside
us
and
was
inside
our
fathers
could
have
predicted
what
was
to
take
place
beginning
with
smolensk
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
moscow
had
been
happening
in
all
the
towns
and
villages
on
russian
soil
without
the
participation
of
rastopchin
and
his
posters
people
nonchalantly
awaited
the
enemy
did
not
riot
did
not
fret
did
not
tear
anyone
to
pieces
but
calmly
awaited
their
fate
feeling
themselves
strong
enough
to
find
at
the
most
difficult
moment
what
needed
to
be
done
and
as
soon
as
the
enemy
approached
the
wealthiest
elements
of
the
population
left
abandoning
their
property
the
poorest
stayed
and
set
fire
to
and
destroyed
what
remained
the
consciousness
that
it
would
be
so
and
always
would
be
so
lay
and
lies
in
the
soul
of
every
russian
and
that
consciousness
and
what
is
more
the
foreboding
that
moscow
would
be
taken
lay
in
russian
moscow
society
in
the
year
twelve
those
who
started
leaving
moscow
already
in
july
and
the
beginning
of
august
showed
that
they
expected
it
those
who
left
taking
along
whatever
they
could
abandoning
houses
and
half
their
property
acted
that
way
because
of
the
hidden
latent
patriotism
which
is
expressed
not
in
phrases
not
in
the
killing
of
children
to
save
the
fatherland
and
similar
unnatural
acts
but
inconspicuously
simply
organically
and
therefore
always
produces
the
strongest
results
it
is
shameful
to
flee
from
danger
only
cowards
are
fleeing
moscow
they
were
told
rastopchin
in
his
little
posters
kept
instilling
in
them
that
to
leave
moscow
was
disgraceful
people
were
ashamed
to
be
called
cowards
were
ashamed
to
go
but
all
the
same
they
went
knowing
that
it
had
to
be
so
why
did
they
go
it
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
rastopchin
had
frightened
them
with
the
horrors
napoleon
had
committed
in
conquered
lands
the
first
to
leave
were
the
rich
educated
people
who
knew
very
well
that
vienna
and
berlin
remained
intact
and
that
there
during
napoleons
occupation
the
citizens
passed
the
time
gaily
with
the
charming
frenchmen
whom
the
russians
and
especially
the
ladies
liked
so
much
then
they
went
because
for
russians
there
could
be
no
question
of
whether
it
would
be
good
or
bad
under
french
rule
in
moscow
to
be
under
french
rule
was
impossible
it
was
the
worst
thing
of
all
they
were
leaving
before
the
battle
of
borodino
and
still
more
quickly
after
the
battle
of
borodino
despite
the
call
to
defense
despite
the
announcement
by
moscows
commander
in
chief
of
his
intention
to
take
up
the
iverskaya
icon
and
go
to
fight
and
the
hotair
balloons
that
were
to
destroy
the
french
and
despite
all
the
nonsense
rastopchin
wrote
in
his
posters
they
knew
it
was
for
the
army
to
fight
and
if
it
could
not
it
was
impossible
to
go
to
the
three
hills
with
young
ladies
and
servants
to
fight
napoleon
and
they
had
to
leave
however
sorry
they
were
to
abandon
their
property
to
destruction
they
were
leaving
without
thinking
of
the
majestic
significance
of
that
huge
wealthy
capital
being
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
and
obviously
burned
a
large
wooden
city
was
bound
to
be
burned
each
was
leaving
for
his
own
sake
and
at
the
same
time
it
was
only
because
they
left
that
that
majestic
event
took
place
which
will
forever
remain
the
finest
glory
of
the
russian
people
the
lady
who
in
the
month
of
june
was
already
moving
out
of
moscow
to
her
estate
near
saratov
with
her
blackamoors
and
women
jesters
with
a
vague
awareness
that
she
was
not
a
servant
to
bonaparte
and
fearing
she
might
be
stopped
by
an
order
from
count
rastopchin
was
performing
simply
and
genuinely
that
great
deed
which
saved
russia
but
count
rastopchin
who
now
shamed
those
who
were
leaving
now
evacuated
government
offices
now
distributed
goodfornothing
weapons
among
the
drunken
riffraff
now
took
up
icons
now
forbade
augustin
to
evacuate
relics
and
icons
now
confiscated
all
private
carts
now
transported
the
hotair
balloon
constructed
by
leppich
on
a
hundred
and
thirtysix
carts
now
hinted
that
he
would
burn
moscow
now
told
how
he
had
burned
his
own
house
and
wrote
a
proclamation
to
the
french
in
which
he
solemnly
reproached
them
for
destroying
his
orphanage
now
he
assumed
the
glory
of
having
burned
moscow
now
he
renounced
it
now
he
ordered
the
people
to
catch
all
the
spies
and
bring
them
to
him
now
he
reproached
the
people
for
it
now
he
banished
all
the
french
from
moscow
now
he
allowed
mme
aubertchalmet
the
center
of
all
the
french
population
of
moscow
to
remain
in
the
city
and
ordered
the
old
and
venerable
postmaster
general
klyucharev
who
had
done
nothing
particularly
wrong
to
be
arrested
and
exiled
now
he
gathered
the
people
on
the
three
hills
to
fight
the
french
now
in
order
to
be
rid
of
those
same
people
he
turned
them
loose
to
murder
a
man
and
escaped
through
the
back
gate
himself
now
he
said
he
would
not
survive
the
misfortune
of
moscow
now
he
wrote
french
verses
in
an
album
about
his
the
affair
this
man
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
event
that
was
taking
place
but
only
wanted
to
do
something
himself
to
astonish
someone
or
other
to
accomplish
something
patriotically
heroic
and
like
a
boy
frolicked
over
the
majestic
and
inevitable
event
of
the
abandoning
and
burning
of
moscow
and
tried
with
his
little
hand
now
to
encourage
now
to
stem
the
flow
of
the
enormous
current
of
people
which
carried
him
along
with
it
vi
h233l232ne
having
returned
with
the
court
from
vilno
to
petersburg
found
herself
in
a
difficult
situation
in
petersburg
h233l232ne
enjoyed
the
special
patronage
of
a
dignitary
who
occupied
one
of
the
highest
posts
in
the
state
in
vilno
she
had
become
close
with
a
young
foreign
prince
when
she
returned
to
petersburg
both
the
prince
and
the
dignitary
were
there
both
claimed
their
rights
and
h233l232ne
was
faced
with
a
new
task
in
her
career
to
maintain
her
close
relations
with
them
both
without
offending
either
what
would
have
seemed
difficult
and
even
impossible
for
another
woman
never
once
made
countess
bezukhov
stop
and
thinkclearly
it
was
not
in
vain
that
she
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
a
most
intelligent
woman
if
she
had
begun
to
conceal
her
actions
to
extricate
herself
by
cunning
from
an
awkward
situation
she
would
thereby
have
spoiled
things
for
herself
acknowledging
herself
guilty
but
h233l232ne
on
the
contrary
like
a
truly
great
person
who
can
do
whatever
she
likes
at
once
placed
herself
in
the
position
of
being
right
in
which
she
sincerely
believed
and
all
the
others
in
the
position
of
being
wrong
the
first
time
the
young
foreign
person
allowed
himself
to
reproach
her
she
proudly
raised
her
beautiful
head
and
half
turning
to
him
said
firmly

the
person
wanted
to
say
something
h233l232ne
interrupted
him
eh
bien
oui
she
said

a
pour

she
concluded
touching
her
high
beautiful
breasts
with
her
hand
and
glancing
up
at
the
sky
mais

said
h233l232ne
bursting
into
tears
the
person
began
to
comfort
her
h233l232ne
said
through
her
tears
as
if
forgetting
herself
that
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
marrying
that
there
were
examples
there
were
still
few
examples
then
but
she
named
napoleon
and
other
highly
placed
persons
that
she
had
never
been
a
wife
to
her
husband
that
she
had
been
sacrificed
but
laws
religion
said
the
person
already
yielding
laws
religionwhy
would
they
have
been
invented
if
they
couldnt
do
that
said
h233l232ne
the
important
person
was
astonished
that
such
a
simple
argument
could
have
failed
to
occur
to
him
and
turned
for
advice
to
the
holy
brothers
of
the
society
of
jesus
with
whom
he
was
in
close
relations
several
days
later
at
one
of
the
enchanting
f234tes
given
by
h233l232ne
at
her
summer
house
on
kamenny
island
the
enchanting
m
de
jobert
was
introduced
to
her
a
man
no
longer
young
with
snowwhite
hair
and
shining
black
eyes
un
j233suite
224
robe
courte
who
had
a
long
conversation
with
h233l232ne
in
the
light
of
the
garden
illuminations
and
to
the
sounds
of
music
about
the
love
of
god
of
christ
of
the
heart
of
the
mother
of
god
and
about
the
comforts
provided
in
this
life
and
the
next
by
the
one
true
catholic
religion
h233l232ne
was
moved
and
several
times
both
she
and
m
de
jobert
had
tears
in
their
eyes
and
a
tremor
in
their
voices
a
dance
to
which
a
partner
came
to
invite
h233l232ne
disrupted
her
conversation
with
her
future
directeur
de
conscience
but
the
next
day
m
jobert
came
alone
in
the
evening
to
see
h233l232ne
and
after
that
began
to
frequent
her
one
day
he
took
the
countess
to
the
catholic
church
where
she
knelt
before
the
altar
she
had
been
brought
to
the
enchanting
nottooyoung
frenchman
placed
his
hands
on
her
head
and
as
she
herself
recounted
later
she
felt
something
like
a
breath
of
fresh
wind
descend
into
her
soul
it
was
explained
to
her
that
this
was
la
gr226ce
then
an
abb233
224
robe
longue
was
brought
to
her
and
he
confessed
her
and
gave
her
absolution
of
her
sins
the
next
day
a
box
with
communion
in
it
was
brought
to
her
and
left
for
home
use
a
few
days
later
h233l232ne
to
her
satisfaction
learned
that
she
had
now
joined
the
true
catholic
church
and
that
one
of
those
days
the
pope
himself
would
learn
of
her
and
send
her
some
document
all
that
was
happening
around
her
and
to
her
at
this
time
all
this
attention
paid
to
her
by
so
many
intelligent
people
and
expressed
in
such
pleasant
refined
forms
and
the
dovelike
purity
in
which
she
now
found
herself
she
wore
white
dresses
with
white
ribbons
all
that
timeall
this
afforded
her
pleasure
but
never
for
a
moment
did
she
lose
sight
of
her
goal
beyond
that
pleasure
and
as
it
always
happens
in
matters
of
cunning
that
a
stupid
person
tricks
the
more
intelligent
she
having
realized
that
the
goal
of
all
this
talk
and
fuss
consisted
primarily
in
converting
her
to
catholicism
in
order
to
take
money
from
her
for
the
benefit
of
jesuit
institutions
of
which
they
had
given
her
hints
h233l232ne
before
giving
money
insisted
that
various
operations
be
performed
over
her
that
would
free
her
from
her
husband
to
her
mind
the
meaning
of
any
religion
consisted
only
in
observing
certain
decencies
while
satisfying
human
desires
and
with
that
purpose
in
one
of
her
talks
with
her
spiritual
director
she
insistently
demanded
an
answer
to
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
her
marriage
bound
her
they
were
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
by
the
window
it
was
twilight
through
the
window
came
the
scent
of
flowers
h233l232ne
was
wearing
a
white
dress
transparent
on
the
shoulders
and
breast
the
abb233
a
wellfed
man
with
a
plump
cleanshaven
chin
a
pleasant
firm
mouth
and
white
hands
folded
meekly
on
his
knees
sat
close
to
h233l232ne
and
with
a
subtle
smile
on
his
lips
looked
at
her
face
now
and
then
with
a
glance
peacefully
admiring
of
her
beauty
and
expounded
his
view
of
the
question
that
concerned
them
h233l232ne
smiling
uneasily
looked
at
his
wavy
hair
cleanshaven
plump
bluish
cheeks
and
expected
the
conversation
to
take
a
new
turn
any
moment
but
the
abb233
though
obviously
enjoying
the
beauty
and
closeness
of
his
interlocutrice
was
carried
away
by
his
mastery
of
the
case
the
course
of
the
spiritual
directors
reasoning
was
as
follows
in
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
what
you
were
undertaking
you
gave
a
vow
of
marital
fidelity
to
a
man
who
for
his
part
having
entered
into
marriage
without
believing
in
its
religious
meaning
had
committed
blasphemy
this
marriage
did
not
have
the
double
meaning
it
should
have
had
but
despite
that
you
were
bound
by
your
vow
you
departed
from
it
what
did
you
commit
in
so
doing
a
p233ch233
veniel
or
a
p233ch233
mortel
a
p233ch233
veniel
because
you
committed
your
act
without
bad
intent
if
you
now
entered
into
a
new
marriage
with
the
purpose
of
having
children
your
sin
could
be
forgiven
but
again
the
question
falls
into
two
parts
first
but
i
think
said
the
suddenly
bored
h233l232ne
with
her
enchanting
smile
that
having
embraced
the
true
religion
i
cannot
be
bound
by
what
a
false
religion
imposed
on
me
the
directeur
de
conscience
was
astounded
by
this
columbuss
egg
that
stood
before
him
with
such
simplicity
he
was
delighted
with
the
unexpectedly
quick
success
of
his
pupil
but
could
not
renounce
the
edifice
of
arguments
he
had
erected
with
such
mental
labor
entendonsnous
comtesse
he
said
with
a
smile
and
began
to
refute
the
reasoning
of
his
spiritual
daughter
vii
h233l232ne
realized
that
the
case
was
very
simple
and
easy
from
the
point
of
view
of
spiritual
direction
but
that
her
directors
made
difficulties
only
because
they
had
apprehensions
about
how
the
secular
authorities
would
look
at
it
and
as
a
result
h233l232ne
decided
that
the
case
had
to
be
prepared
for
in
society
she
provoked
the
jealousy
of
the
old
dignitary
and
told
him
the
same
thing
as
the
first
suitor
that
is
put
things
so
that
the
only
way
to
obtain
rights
over
her
was
to
marry
her
the
old
important
person
was
as
struck
for
the
first
moment
by
this
proposal
to
marry
her
while
her
husband
was
living
as
the
first
young
person
had
been
but
h233l232nes
unshakeable
conviction
that
this
was
as
simple
and
natural
as
a
young
girl
getting
married
had
its
effect
on
him
too
if
even
the
slightest
signs
of
hesitation
shame
or
secretiveness
had
been
noticeable
in
h233l232ne
herself
her
case
would
undoubtedly
have
been
lost
but
not
only
were
there
no
signs
of
secretiveness
or
shame
but
on
the
contrary
with
simplicity
and
goodnatured
na239vet233
she
told
her
close
friends
and
that
meant
all
petersburg
that
both
the
prince
and
the
dignitary
had
proposed
to
her
and
that
she
loved
them
both
and
was
afraid
to
upset
either
of
them
the
rumor
instantly
spread
through
petersburg
not
that
h233l232ne
wanted
to
divorce
her
husband
if
such
a
rumor
had
spread
a
great
many
people
would
have
risen
up
against
such
an
unlawful
intention
but
simply
that
the
unfortunate
interesting
h233l232ne
was
in
perplexity
about
which
of
the
two
men
to
marry
the
question
now
consisted
not
in
the
degree
to
which
this
was
possible
but
only
in
which
match
was
the
more
advantageous
and
how
the
court
would
look
at
it
there
were
indeed
some
obdurate
people
who
were
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
the
question
and
saw
in
this
project
a
profanation
of
the
sacrament
of
marriage
but
they
were
few
and
they
kept
quiet
while
the
majority
was
interested
in
the
questions
of
the
happiness
that
had
befallen
h233l232ne
and
which
choice
was
better
as
for
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
to
marry
while
ones
husband
was
living
no
one
spoke
of
it
because
this
question
had
obviously
already
been
decided
by
people
more
intelligent
than
you
and
i
as
they
said
and
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
the
decision
would
mean
to
risk
showing
ones
stupidity
and
inability
to
live
in
society
only
marya
dmitrievna
akhrosimov
who
came
to
petersburg
that
summer
to
meet
one
of
her
sons
allowed
herself
to
openly
express
her
opinion
which
ran
counter
to
that
of
society
meeting
h233l232ne
at
a
ball
marya
dmitrievna
stopped
her
in
the
middle
of
the
ballroom
and
amidst
the
general
silence
said
to
her
in
her
gruff
voice
so
here
youve
started
this
marrying
while
the
husbands
still
living
maybe
you
think
youve
invented
some
novelty
youve
been
forestalled
dearie
it
was
invented
long
ago
they
do
it
in
all
the
and
with
those
words
marya
dmitrievna
with
a
habitual
threatening
gesture
pushing
up
her
wide
sleeves
and
looking
around
sternly
strode
through
the
room
marya
dmitrievna
though
feared
was
looked
upon
in
petersburg
as
a
jester
and
therefore
of
the
words
she
had
spoken
only
the
crude
word
was
noticed
and
repeated
among
them
in
a
whisper
supposing
that
that
one
word
contained
all
the
salt
of
what
she
had
said
prince
vassily
who
forgot
what
he
said
especially
often
of
late
and
repeated
the
same
thing
a
hundred
times
said
each
time
he
happened
to
see
his
daughter
h233l232ne
jai
un
mot
224
vous
dire
he
said
taking
her
aside
and
pulling
her
hand
down
jai

eh

consultez
que

ce
que

dis
and
concealing
ever
the
same
emotion
he
pressed
his
cheek
to
his
daughters
cheek
and
walked
away
bilibin
who
had
not
lost
his
reputation
as
a
most
intelligent
man
and
who
was
h233l232nes
disinterested
friend
one
of
those
friends
that
brilliant
women
always
have
male
friends
who
can
never
pass
into
the
category
of
lovers
bilibin
once
in
a
petit
comit233
voiced
his
view
of
this
matter
to
his
friend
h233l232ne
201coutez
bilibine
h233l232ne
always
called
such
friends
as
bilibin
by
their
last
name
and
she
touched
the
sleeve
of
his
tailcoat
with
her
white
beringed
hand
ditesmoi

vous

224
une

faire

bilibin
gathered
the
skin
over
his
eyebrows
and
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
fell
to
thinking
vous
ne
me
prenez

en

vous

he
said

and
he
released
the
skin
voil224
un

said
h233l232ne
brightening
up
and
touching
bilibins
sleeve
once
again

she
said
bilibin
shrugged
his
shoulders
showing
that
even
he
could
do
nothing
about
such
a
plight

thought
bilibin
but
tell
me
how
will
your
husband
look
at
the
matter
he
said
his
reputation
being
so
firmly
founded
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
harming
himself
by
such
a
na239ve
question

he

said
h233l232ne
who
for
some
reason
fancied
that
pierre
also
loved
her

bilibin
gathered
the
skin
to
indicate
that
a
mot
was
in
preparation
m234me
le
divorce
he
said
h233l232ne
laughed
among
the
people
who
allowed
themselves
to
doubt
the
lawfulness
of
the
projected
marriage
was
h233l232nes
mother
princess
kuragin
she
was
constantly
tormented
by
envy
of
her
daughter
and
now
when
the
subject
of
envy
was
closest
to
the
princesss
heart
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
this
thought
she
consulted
with
a
russian
priest
about
the
extent
to
which
it
was
possible
to
divorce
and
enter
into
marriage
while
the
husband
was
living
and
the
priest
told
her
it
was
impossible
and
to
her
joy
pointed
out
to
her
a
gospel
text
which
as
it
seemed
to
the
priest
rejected
outright
the
possibility
of
entering
into
marriage
while
the
husband
is
living
armed
with
these
arguments
which
to
her
seemed
irrefutable
the
princess
went
to
her
daughter
early
one
morning
so
as
to
find
her
alone
having
heard
her
mothers
objections
h233l232ne
smiled
meekly
and
mockingly
but
it
says
straight
out
whoever
marries
a
divorced
woman
said
the
old
princess
ah
maman
ne
dites
pas
de
b234tises
vous
ne
comprenez
rien
dans
ma
position
jai
des
devoirs
h233l232ne
began
switching
to
french
from
russian
in
which
it
always
seemed
to
her
there
was
some
lack
of
clarity
in
her
case
but
my
friend
ah
maman
comment
estce
que
vous
ne
comprenez
pas
que
le
saint
p232re
qui
a
le
droit
de
donner
des
dispenses
just
then
a
lady
companion
who
lived
at
h233l232nes
came
to
report
that
his
highness
was
in
the
reception
room
and
wished
to
see
her
non
diteslui
que
je
ne
veux
pas
le
voir

suis
furieuse
contre
lui
parce
quil

mis233ricorde
said
a
fairhaired
young
man
with
a
long
face
and
nose
coming
in
the
old
princess
respectfully
rose
and
curtsied
the
young
man
paid
no
attention
to
her
the
princess
nodded
to
her
daughter
and
sailed
towards
the
door
no
shes
right
thought
the
old
princess
all
of
whose
convictions
crumbled
before
the
appearance
of
his
highness
shes
right
but
how
is
it
we
didnt
know
it
in
our
longlost
youth
yet
it
was
so
simple
thought
the
old
princess
getting
into
her
carriage
at
the
beginning
of
august
h233l232nes
case
became
perfectly
defined
and
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
husband
who
loved
her
very
much
as
she
thought
in
which
she
informed
him
of
her
intention
to
marry
n
n
and
of
the
fact
that
she
had
embraced
the
one
true
religion
and
that
she
asked
him
to
go
through
all
the
necessary
formalities
for
divorce
of
which
the
bearer
of
the
letter
would
inform
him
sur
ce
je
prie
dieu
mon
ami
de
vous
avoir
sous
sa
sainte
et
puissante
garde
votre
amie
h233l232ne
this
letter
was
brought
to
pierres
house
at
the
time
when
he
was
on
the
field
of
borodino
viii
having
run
down
from
the
raevsky
battery
for
the
second
time
towards
the
end
of
the
battle
of
borodino
pierre
with
crowds
of
soldiers
made
his
way
through
the
gully
towards
knyazkovo
reached
the
dressing
station
and
seeing
blood
and
hearing
cries
and
moans
hastened
on
mixing
with
the
crowds
of
soldiers
the
one
thing
pierre
now
desired
with
all
the
forces
of
his
soul
was
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
those
dreadful
impressions
in
which
he
had
lived
that
day
to
return
to
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
and
fall
peacefully
asleep
in
a
room
on
his
own
bed
he
felt
that
only
in
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
would
he
be
able
to
understand
himself
and
all
that
he
had
seen
and
experienced
but
there
were
no
ordinary
conditions
of
life
anywhere
though
there
was
no
whistling
of
cannonballs
and
bullets
here
on
the
road
he
was
walking
along
there
was
on
all
sides
the
same
thing
as
there
on
the
battlefield
there
were
the
same
suffering
tormented
and
sometimes
strangely
indifferent
faces
the
same
blood
the
same
soldiers
greatcoats
the
same
sounds
of
gunfire
distant
now
but
arousing
terror
all
the
same
besides
it
was
stifling
and
dusty
having
gone
some
two
miles
along
the
mozhaisk
high
road
pierre
sat
down
by
the
roadside
dusk
had
fallen
over
the
earth
and
the
roar
of
the
artillery
had
died
down
pierre
propping
himself
on
his
elbow
lay
down
and
stayed
that
way
for
a
long
time
gazing
at
the
shadows
that
moved
past
him
in
the
darkness
he
kept
fancying
that
a
cannonball
was
flying
at
him
with
a
frightful
whistling
he
would
give
a
start
and
raise
himself
up
he
did
not
remember
how
long
he
lay
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night
three
soldiers
bringing
brushwood
settled
next
to
him
and
began
to
make
a
fire
the
soldiers
glancing
sidelong
at
pierre
made
the
fire
put
a
kettle
on
it
crumbled
some
biscuits
into
it
and
added
some
lard
the
pleasant
smell
of
edible
and
greasy
viands
mingled
with
the
smell
of
smoke
pierre
sat
up
and
sighed
the
soldiers
there
were
three
of
them
were
eating
without
paying
attention
to
pierre
and
talking
among
themselves
and
what
sort
are
you
one
of
the
soldiers
suddenly
addressed
pierre
obviously
implying
by
this
question
what
pierre
was
thinking
namely
if
you
want
to
eat
well
give
you
some
only
tell
us
if
youre
an
honest
man
i
i
said
pierre
feeling
it
necessary
to
diminish
his
social
position
as
much
as
possible
so
as
to
be
closer
and
more
understandable
to
the
soldiers
im
actually
a
militia
officer
only
my
detachment
isnt
here
i
was
in
the
battle
and
lost
my
men
just
look
at
that
said
one
of
the
soldiers
another
soldier
shook
his
head
well
then
eat
some
of
our
mess
if
you
want
said
the
first
and
he
handed
pierre
a
wooden
spoon
after
licking
it
clean
pierre
moved
towards
the
fire
and
began
to
eat
the
mess
that
was
in
the
kettle
and
that
seemed
to
him
the
tastiest
of
all
the
dishes
he
had
ever
eaten
while
he
bent
over
the
kettle
scooping
up
big
spoonfuls
and
greedily
chewing
one
after
another
his
face
could
be
seen
in
the
firelight
and
the
soldiers
silently
looked
at
him
where
are
you
headed
tell
us
one
of
them
again
asked
to
mozhaisk
so
youd
be
a
gentleman
yes
and
whats
your
name
pyotr
kirillovich
well
pyotr
kirillovich
come
on
well
take
you
there
in
total
darkness
the
soldiers
walked
with
pierre
towards
mozhaisk
the
cocks
were
already
crowing
when
they
reached
mozhaisk
and
began
to
climb
the
steep
town
hill
pierre
walked
with
the
soldiers
having
forgotten
completely
that
his
inn
was
below
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
that
he
had
already
gone
past
it
he
would
not
have
remembered
it
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
bewilderment
if
halfway
up
the
hill
he
had
not
run
into
his
groom
who
had
gone
looking
for
him
all
over
the
town
and
was
now
going
back
to
the
inn
the
groom
recognized
pierre
by
his
hat
showing
white
in
the
darkness
your
excellency
he
said
weve
been
in
despair
why
are
you
on
foot
where
are
you
going
if
you
please
ah
yes
said
pierre
the
soldiers
stopped
well
so
youve
found
your
people
said
one
of
them
well
goodbye
to
you
pyotr
kirillovich
is
it
goodbye
to
you
pyotr
kirillovich
said
other
voices
goodbye
said
pierre
and
he
headed
for
the
inn
together
with
his
groom
i
should
give
them
something
pierre
thought
putting
his
hand
to
his
pocket
no
you
shouldnt
some
voice
said
to
him
there
was
no
place
left
in
the
rooms
of
the
inn
they
were
all
taken
pierre
went
out
to
the
yard
and
covering
himself
head
and
all
lay
down
in
his
carriage
ix
pierre
had
barely
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
when
he
felt
himself
falling
asleep
but
suddenly
with
an
almost
lifelike
clarity
he
heard
the
boomboomboom
of
gunfire
heard
groans
cries
the
smack
of
projectiles
smelled
blood
and
powder
and
a
feeling
of
terror
and
the
fear
of
death
seized
him
frightened
he
opened
his
eyes
and
raised
his
head
from
under
the
greatcoat
all
was
quiet
in
the
courtyard
only
some
orderly
came
through
the
gate
talking
with
the
yard
porter
and
splashing
through
the
mud
some
pigeons
above
pierres
head
in
the
dark
under
the
wooden
eaves
were
roused
by
the
movement
he
made
as
he
raised
himself
the
whole
courtyard
was
filled
with
the
peaceful
strong
smell
of
an
inn
which
gladdened
pierre
at
that
moment
the
smell
of
hay
dung
and
tar
between
the
two
black
sheds
the
clear
starry
night
could
be
seen
thank
god
theres
no
more
of
that
thought
pierre
covering
his
head
again
oh
how
terrible
fear
is
and
how
disgracefully
i
yielded
to
it
and
theythey
were
firm
calm
all
the
time
till
the
end
they
to
pierres
mind
were
the
soldiersthose
who
had
been
at
the
battery
and
those
who
had
fed
him
and
those
who
had
prayed
before
the
icon
theythese
strange
people
hitherto
unknown
to
himthey
were
clearly
and
sharply
separated
in
his
mind
from
all
other
people
to
be
a
soldier
simply
a
soldier
thought
pierre
falling
asleep
to
enter
that
common
life
with
my
whole
being
to
be
pervaded
by
what
makes
them
that
way
but
how
to
cast
off
all
thats
superfluous
devilish
all
the
burden
of
the
outer
man
at
one
time
i
could
have
been
that
i
could
have
run
away
from
my
father
as
i
wanted
to
i
could
have
been
sent
off
as
a
soldier
after
the
duel
with
dolokhov
and
there
flashed
in
pierres
imagination
the
dinner
at
the
club
when
he
had
challenged
dolokhov
and
his
benefactor
in
torzhok
and
now
pierre
pictures
to
himself
the
solemn
dining
room
of
the
lodge
this
lodge
is
meeting
in
the
english
club
and
someone
familiar
close
dear
is
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
it
is
he
it
is
his
benefactor
but
isnt
he
dead
thought
pierre
yes
dead
but
i
didnt
know
he
was
alive
how
sorry
i
am
that
hes
dead
and
how
glad
i
am
that
hes
alive
again
on
one
side
of
the
table
sat
anatole
dolokhov
nesvitsky
denisov
and
others
like
them
in
his
dream
the
category
of
these
people
was
as
clearly
defined
in
pierres
soul
as
the
category
of
people
he
called
they
and
these
people
anatole
dolokhov
were
shouting
and
singing
loudly
but
from
beyond
their
shouting
the
voice
of
his
benefactor
could
be
heard
talking
ceaselessly
and
the
sound
of
his
words
was
as
significant
and
constant
as
the
noise
of
the
battlefield
yet
it
was
pleasant
and
comforting
pierre
did
not
understand
what
his
benefactor
was
saying
but
he
knew
the
categories
of
thought
were
just
as
clear
in
his
dream
that
the
benefactor
was
speaking
of
the
good
of
the
possibility
of
being
what
they
were
and
they
surrounded
his
benefactor
on
all
sides
with
their
simple
kind
firm
faces
but
although
they
were
kind
they
were
not
looking
at
pierre
they
did
not
know
him
pierre
wanted
to
attract
their
attention
and
speak
he
rose
a
little
but
just
then
his
feet
became
cold
and
bare
he
was
embarrassed
and
covered
his
feet
with
his
hand
from
which
the
overcoat
had
actually
fallen
for
a
moment
as
he
straightened
the
overcoat
pierre
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
sheds
posts
courtyard
but
it
was
all
bluish
now
bright
and
covered
with
sparkles
of
dew
or
frost
day
is
breaking
thought
pierre
but
thats
not
it
i
have
to
finish
listening
and
understand
the
words
of
my
benefactor
he
covered
himself
again
with
the
overcoat
but
the
dining
room
lodge
and
his
benefactor
were
no
longer
there
there
were
only
thoughts
clearly
expressed
in
words
thoughts
which
someone
spoke
or
pierre
himself
pondered
recalling
these
thoughts
afterwards
pierre
was
convinced
that
even
though
they
had
been
called
up
by
the
impressions
of
the
day
someone
outside
him
had
spoken
them
to
him
never
as
it
seemed
to
him
would
he
have
been
able
to
think
and
express
his
thoughts
that
way
in
a
waking
state
war
is
the
most
difficult
subjection
of
mans
freedom
to
the
laws
of
god
the
voice
said
simplicity
is
obedience
to
god
you
cannot
get
away
from
him
and
they
are
simple
they
dont
talk
they
do
a
word
spoken
is
silver
unspoken
is
gold
man
cannot
possess
anything
as
long
as
he
fears
death
but
to
him
who
does
not
fear
it
everything
belongs
if
there
was
no
suffering
man
would
not
know
his
limits
would
not
know
himself
the
most
difficult
thing
pierre
went
on
thinking
or
hearing
in
his
sleep
consists
in
being
able
to
unite
the
meaning
of
all
things
in
his
soul
to
unite
all
things
pierre
said
to
himself
no
not
to
unite
its
impossible
to
unite
thoughts
but
to
hitch
together
all
these
thoughtsthats
whats
needed
yes
we
must
hitch
together
hitch
together
pierre
repeated
to
himself
with
inner
rapture
feeling
that
precisely
these
and
only
these
words
expressed
what
he
wanted
to
express
and
resolved
the
whole
question
that
tormented
him
yes
we
must
hitch
together
its
time
to
hitch
together
we
must
hitch
up
its
time
to
hitch
up
your
excellency
your
excellency
some
voice
repeated
we
must
hitch
up
its
time
to
hitch
up
it
was
the
voice
of
his
groom
waking
pierre
up
the
sun
was
shining
directly
into
pierres
face
he
glanced
at
the
dirty
inn
yard
in
the
middle
of
which
soldiers
were
watering
some
scrawny
horses
and
from
which
wagons
were
driving
through
the
gate
pierre
turned
away
with
revulsion
closed
his
eyes
and
quickly
fell
back
again
on
the
seat
of
the
carriage
no
i
dont
want
it
i
dont
want
to
see
or
understand
it
i
want
to
understand
what
was
being
revealed
to
me
in
my
dream
one
more
second
and
id
have
understood
everything
what
am
i
to
do
hitch
together
but
how
hitch
everything
together
and
pierre
felt
with
horror
that
all
the
meaning
of
what
he
had
seen
and
thought
in
his
dream
was
destroyed
the
groom
the
coachman
and
the
yard
porter
told
pierre
that
an
officer
had
arrived
with
news
that
the
french
were
advancing
on
mozhaisk
and
that
our
troops
were
leaving
pierre
got
up
and
ordering
them
to
harness
the
carriage
and
catch
up
with
him
set
off
on
foot
through
the
town
the
troops
were
leaving
and
abandoning
about
ten
thousand
wounded
these
wounded
could
be
seen
in
the
courtyards
and
in
the
windows
of
houses
and
crowding
in
the
streets
in
the
streets
around
the
wagons
that
were
to
take
the
wounded
away
shouts
curses
and
blows
could
be
heard
pierres
carriage
caught
up
with
him
and
he
offered
it
to
a
wounded
general
of
his
acquaintance
and
drove
with
him
to
moscow
on
the
way
pierre
learned
of
the
death
of
his
brotherinlaw
and
the
death
of
prince
andrei
x
on
the
thirtieth
pierre
returned
to
moscow
almost
at
the
city
gate
he
ran
into
count
rastopchins
adjutant
weve
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
said
the
adjutant
the
count
absolutely
must
see
you
he
asks
you
to
come
at
once
on
very
important
business
pierre
without
stopping
at
home
hired
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
commander
in
chief
count
rastopchin
had
come
to
town
from
his
suburban
house
in
sokolniki
only
that
morning
the
anteroom
and
waiting
room
in
the
counts
house
were
full
of
officials
who
had
come
at
his
request
or
to
receive
orders
vasilchikov
and
platov
had
already
seen
the
count
and
explained
to
him
that
to
defend
moscow
was
impossible
and
that
it
would
be
surrendered
this
news
was
concealed
from
the
inhabitants
but
the
officials
the
heads
of
various
departments
knew
that
moscow
was
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
just
as
count
rastopchin
knew
it
and
to
shift
responsibility
from
themselves
they
all
came
to
the
commander
in
chief
to
ask
what
to
do
with
the
institutions
they
were
in
charge
of
just
as
pierre
came
into
the
anteroom
the
courier
who
had
come
from
the
army
was
leaving
the
counts
office
the
courier
waved
hopelessly
to
the
questions
people
addressed
to
him
and
walked
through
the
room
while
sitting
in
the
anteroom
pierre
looked
around
with
weary
eyes
at
the
various
officials
old
and
young
military
and
civilian
significant
and
insignificant
who
were
in
the
room
they
all
seemed
displeased
and
restless
pierre
went
over
to
one
group
of
officials
in
which
there
was
one
of
his
acquaintances
having
greeted
pierre
they
went
on
with
their
conversation
to
send
them
away
and
bring
them
back
again
wouldnt
do
any
harm
but
in
this
situation
one
cant
answer
for
anything
but
look
at
what
he
writes
said
another
pointing
to
a
printed
sheet
he
was
holding
in
his
hand
thats
another
matter
the
people
need
it
said
the
first
what
is
it
asked
pierre
a
new
poster
pierre
took
it
and
began
to
read
the
most
serene
prince
in
order
to
join
quickly
with
the
troops
coming
to
him
has
passed
through
mozhaisk
and
stopped
at
a
fortified
place
where
the
enemy
will
not
suddenly
fall
upon
him
fortyeight
cannon
with
ammunition
have
been
sent
to
him
from
here
and
his
serenity
says
he
will
defend
moscow
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
and
is
even
ready
to
fight
in
the
streets
dont
worry
brothers
about
the
closing
of
the
government
offices
we
have
to
keep
things
in
order
but
well
deal
summarily
with
the
villain
when
it
comes
to
that
ill
need
stout
fellows
from
the
city
and
the
country
ill
send
out
a
call
two
days
ahead
but
theres
no
need
yet
and
so
im
silent
an
ax
would
be
a
good
thing
a
spear
wouldnt
be
bad
but
a
pitchfork
would
be
best
a
frenchman
is
no
heavier
than
a
sheaf
of
rye
tomorrow
after
dinner
ill
have
the
iverskaya
icon
taken
up
and
brought
to
the
wounded
in
the
ekaterininsky
hospital
well
bless
the
water
there
theyll
recover
the
sooner
and
ive
now
recovered
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
eye
but
now
im
keeping
them
both
open
but
military
men
told
me
said
pierre
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
in
the
city
and
that
the
position
why
yes
thats
what
were
talking
about
said
the
first
official
but
what
does
it
mean
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
eye
but
now
im
keeping
them
both
open
asked
pierre
the
count
had
a
sty
the
adjutant
said
smiling
and
was
very
worried
when
i
told
him
that
people
were
coming
to
ask
how
he
was
by
the
way
count
the
adjutant
suddenly
added
turning
to
pierre
with
a
smile
weve
heard
you
have
family
troubles
it
seems
that
the
countess
your
wife
i
havent
heard
anything
pierre
said
indifferently
and
what
have
you
heard
no
you
know
people
often
invent
things
im
talking
about
what
ive
heard
what
have
you
heard
they
say
the
adjutant
said
with
the
same
smile
that
the
countess
your
wife
is
preparing
to
go
abroad
its
probably
nonsense
maybe
so
said
pierre
looking
around
distractedly
and
who
is
this
he
asked
pointing
to
a
short
old
man
in
a
clean
blue
merchants
kaftan
with
a
long
snowwhite
beard
similar
eyebrows
and
a
ruddy
face
this
this
is
the
merchant
that
is
the
tavern
keeper
vereshchagin
maybe
youve
heard
that
story
about
the
proclamation
ah
so
this
is
vereshchagin
said
pierre
peering
into
the
old
merchants
firm
and
calm
face
and
searching
for
an
expression
of
treachery
in
it
this
is
not
the
man
himself
this
is
the
father
of
the
one
who
wrote
the
proclamation
said
the
adjutant
that
ones
young
and
sitting
behind
bars
and
it
looks
like
things
will
go
badly
for
him
an
old
man
with
a
star
and
another
a
german
official
with
a
cross
on
his
neck
came
up
to
the
conversing
men
you
see
the
adjutant
was
saying
its
a
tangled
story
back
about
two
months
ago
this
proclamation
appeared
the
count
was
informed
he
ordered
an
investigation
gavrilo
ivanych
here
found
out
that
the
proclamation
had
passed
through
exactly
sixtythree
hands
he
comes
to
one
who
did
you
get
it
from
from
soandso
he
goes
to
that
one
and
you
and
so
on
they
got
to
vereshchagina
halfeducated
little
merchant
you
know
a
piddlerdiddler
the
adjutant
said
smiling
they
ask
him
who
did
you
get
it
from
and
the
thing
is
that
we
know
who
he
got
it
from
he
couldnt
have
gotten
it
from
anyone
else
than
the
postmaster
general
but
there
was
clearly
some
collusion
between
them
he
said
from
nobody
i
wrote
it
myself
they
threatened
him
and
pleaded
with
him
but
he
stood
by
it
i
wrote
it
myself
they
reported
it
to
the
count
the
count
told
them
to
summon
him
who
did
you
get
the
proclamation
from
i
wrote
it
myself
well
you
know
the
count
the
adjutant
said
with
a
proud
and
gay
smile
he
flew
into
a
terrible
temper
and
just
think
such
brazenness
lying
and
stubbornness
ah
i
see
the
count
wanted
him
to
point
to
klyucharev
said
pierre
he
didnt
want
that
at
all
the
adjutant
said
in
alarm
klyucharev
had
a
few
sins
to
his
name
without
that
which
is
why
he
was
banished
but
the
thing
was
that
the
count
was
highly
indignant
how
could
you
have
written
it
says
the
count
he
took
the
hamburg
gazette
from
the
table
its
here
you
didnt
write
it
you
translated
it
and
badly
at
that
because
fool
that
you
are
you
dont
even
know
french
and
what
do
you
think
no
he
says
i
didnt
read
any
newspapers
i
wrote
it
myself
if
so
youre
a
traitor
ill
have
you
up
in
court
and
youll
be
hanged
tell
me
who
did
you
get
it
from
i
havent
seen
any
newspapers
i
wrote
it
and
so
it
remained
the
count
summoned
his
father
he
stood
his
ground
they
took
him
to
court
and
sentenced
him
i
believe
to
hard
labor
now
his
father
has
come
to
petition
for
him
but
what
a
nasty
boy
you
know
that
sort
of
little
merchants
son
a
dandy
a
charmer
he
listened
to
some
lectures
and
thinks
he
can
pluck
the
devil
by
the
beard
quite
the
fellow
his
father
keeps
an
inn
here
by
the
kamenny
bridge
and
in
that
inn
theres
a
big
icon
of
god
almighty
you
know
holding
a
scepter
in
one
hand
and
an
orb
in
the
other
so
he
took
the
icon
home
for
a
few
days
and
what
did
he
do
he
found
some
scoundrel
of
a
painter
xi
in
the
middle
of
this
new
story
pierre
was
summoned
to
the
commander
in
chief
pierre
went
into
count
rastopchins
study
rastopchin
scowling
was
rubbing
his
forehead
and
eyes
with
his
hand
as
pierre
came
in
a
short
man
was
saying
something
to
him
but
as
soon
as
pierre
came
in
he
fell
silent
and
left
ah
greetings
great
warrior
said
rastopchin
as
soon
as
the
man
left
weve
heard
about
your
prouesses
but
thats
not
the
point
mon
cher
entre
nous
are
you
a
mason
count
rastopchin
said
in
a
stern
tone
as
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
but
he
intended
to
forgive
it
pierre
said
nothing
mon
cher
je
suis
bien
inform233
but
i
know
that
there
are
masons
and
masons
and
i
hope
you
dont
belong
to
those
who
on
the
pretence
of
saving
mankind
want
to
ruin
russia
yes
i
am
a
mason
pierre
replied
well
there
you
see
my
dear
i
suppose
youre
not
unaware
of
the
fact
that
messrs
speransky
and
magnitsky
have
been
sent
where
they
belong
the
same
has
been
done
with
mr
klyucharev
and
the
same
with
some
others
who
on
the
pretence
of
building
the
temple
of
solomon
were
trying
to
destroy
the
temple
of
their
fatherland
you
can
understand
that
there
are
reasons
for
that
and
that
i
could
not
have
banished
our
postmaster
general
if
he
had
not
been
a
harmful
man
now
i
am
informed
that
you
sent
him
your
carriage
so
that
he
could
leave
the
city
and
that
you
even
took
some
papers
from
him
for
safekeeping
i
like
you
and
dont
wish
you
any
harm
and
since
youre
half
my
age
i
advise
you
like
a
father
to
stop
all
contacts
with
that
sort
of
people
and
leave
here
as
soon
as
possible
but
what
is
klyucharev
guilty
of
count
asked
pierre
thats
for
me
to
know
and
not
for
you
to
ask
exclaimed
rastopchin
if
hes
accused
of
distributing
napoleons
proclamations
that
hasnt
been
proved
said
pierre
not
looking
at
rastopchin
and
vereshchagin
nous
y
voil224
rastopchin
suddenly
frowning
exclaimed
still
more
loudly
than
before
interrupting
pierre
vereshchagin
is
a
traitor
and
a
turncoat
who
will
get
the
punishment
he
deserves
said
rastopchin
with
that
hot
anger
with
which
people
speak
remembering
an
offense
but
i
didnt
send
for
you
in
order
to
discuss
my
affairs
but
so
as
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
or
an
order
if
you
prefer
that
i
ask
you
to
stop
all
contacts
with
gentlemen
the
likes
of
klyucharev
and
to
leave
here
and
ill
knock
the
foolishness
out
of
anyone
who
has
it
in
him
and
probably
realizing
that
he
seemed
to
be
shouting
at
bezukhov
who
so
far
was
not
guilty
of
anything
he
added
taking
pierres
hand
amiably

pierre
replied
still
without
raising
his
eyes
or
changing
the
expression
of
his
pensive
face
the
count
frowned

pierre
made
no
reply
and
frowning
and
angry
as
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
left
rastopchins
office
when
he
reached
home
it
was
already
dusk
some
eight
different
people
visited
him
that
evening
the
secretary
of
a
committee
the
colonel
of
his
battalion
his
steward
his
butler
and
various
petitioners
they
all
had
business
with
pierre
which
he
was
supposed
to
decide
pierre
understood
nothing
was
not
interested
in
these
matters
and
to
all
questions
gave
such
answers
as
would
rid
him
of
these
people
left
alone
at
last
he
opened
and
read
his

and
going
to
his
bed
he
collapsed
on
it
without
undressing
and
fell
asleep
at
once
when
he
woke
up
the
next
morning
his
butler
came
to
tell
him
that
a
specially
sent
police
official
had
come
from
count
rastopchin
to
find
out
whether
count
bezukhov
had
left
or
was
leaving
some
ten
people
of
various
sorts
having
business
with
pierre
were
waiting
for
him
in
the
drawing
room
pierre
hurriedly
dressed
and
instead
of
going
to
those
who
were
waiting
for
him
went
to
the
back
door
and
from
there
left
through
the
gate
from
then
on
until
the
end
of
the
devastation
of
moscow
no
one
of
the
bezukhov
household
in
spite
of
all
their
searching
saw
any
more
of
pierre
or
knew
where
he
was
xii
the
rostovs
remained
in
the
city
until
the
first
of

that
is
until
the

of

into

after

the
regiment
was
being
formed
the
countess
was
overcome
with
fear
the
thought
that
both
of
her
sons
were
at
war
that
they
were
both
no
longer
under
her
wing
that
today
or
tomorrow
either
one
of
them
and
maybe
both
together
like
the
three
sons
of
one
of
her
acquaintances
might
be
killed
now
for
the
first
time
during
that
summer
came
to
her
mind
with
a
cruel
clarity
she
tried
to
call
nikolai
back
tried
to
go
to
petya
herself
or
to
arrange
a
place
for
him
somewhere
in
petersburg
but
both
proved
impossible
petya
could
not
be
sent
back
except
with
his
regiment
or
by
means
of
a
transfer
to
another
active
regiment
nikolai
was
somewhere
with
the
army
and
after
his
last
letter
in
which
he
had
described
in
detail
his
meeting
with
princess
marya
had
not
been
heard
from
again
the
countess
did
not
sleep
at
night
or
when
she
did
saw
her
sons
killed
in
her
dreams
after
many
discussions
and
negotiations
the
count
finally
thought
of
a
means
to
calm
the
countess
he
transferred
petya
from
obolenskys
regiment
to
bezukhovs
regiment
which
was
being
formed
outside
moscow
though
petya
remained
in
military
service
the
countess
after
this
transfer
had
the
comfort
of
having
at
least
one
son
under
her
wing
and
hoped
to
arrange
things
for
her
petya
so
that
he
would
not
leave
her
again
and
would
always
be
assigned
to
places
of
service
where
there
was
no
chance
of
his
getting
into
battle
while
nicolas
alone
was
in
danger
it
seemed
to
the
countess
and
she
even
felt
sorry
because
of
it
that
she
loved
her
eldest
more
than
the
rest
of
her
children
but
when
her
youngest
the
mischief
the
poor
student
who
broke
everything
in
the
house
and
pestered
everybody
this
snubnosed
petya
with
his
merry
dark
eyes
fresh
ruddy
cheeks
barely
touched
with
down
ended
up
there
with
those
big
frightening
cruel
men
who
were
fighting
over
something
and
found
something
joyful
in
itit
seemed
to
the
mother
that
it
was
him
that
she
loved
more
much
more
than
all
her
other
children
the
closer
it
came
to
the
time
when
the
awaited
petya
was
to
return
to
moscow
the
more
the
countesss
anxiety
grew
she
thought
she
would
never
live
to
see
that
happiness
the
presence
not
only
of
sonya
but
of
her
favorite
natasha
even
of
her
husband
vexed
the
countess
what
do
i
care
about
them
i
dont
need
anyone
but
petya
she
thought
in
the
last
days
of
august
the
rostovs
received
a
second
letter
from
nikolai
he
wrote
from
voronezh
province
where
he
had
been
sent
for
horses
this
letter
did
not
calm
the
countess
knowing
that
one
son
was
out
of
danger
she
began
to
worry
still
more
about
petya
though
by
the
twentieth
of
august
almost
all
the
rostovs
acquaintances
had
left
moscow
though
everyone
tried
to
persuade
the
countess
to
leave
as
soon
as
possible
she
would
hear
nothing
about
departure
until
her
treasure
her
adored
petya
returned
on
the
twentyeighth
of
august
petya
arrived
the
sixteenyearold
officer
did
not
like
the
morbidly
passionate
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
met
him
though
his
mother
concealed
from
him
her
intention
of
not
letting
him
go
again
from
under
her
wing
petya
understood
her
designs
and
instinctively
afraid
of
going
soft
with
his
mother
of
turning
womanish
as
he
thought
to
himself
he
treated
her
coldly
avoided
her
and
during
his
stay
in
moscow
kept
exclusively
to
the
company
of
natasha
for
whom
he
had
always
had
a
special
almost
amorous
brotherly
tenderness
owing
to
the
counts
habitual
insouciance
nothing
was
ready
for
departure
on
the
twentyeighth
of
august
and
the
carts
expected
from
the
ryazan
and
moscow
estates
to
transport
all
the
possessions
from
the
house
arrived
only
on
the
thirtieth
from
the
twentyeighth
to
the
thirtyfirst
of
august
moscow
was
all
bustle
and
commotion
every
day
thousands
of
men
wounded
at
the
battle
of
borodino
were
brought
through
the
dorogomilovo
gate
and
distributed
all
over
moscow
and
thousands
of
carts
with
citizens
and
their
possessions
left
through
other
gates
despite
rastopchins
posters
or
independently
of
them
or
on
account
of
them
the
most
strange
and
contradictory
news
spread
about
town
some
said
that
no
one
was
allowed
to
leave
some
on
the
contrary
said
that
all
the
icons
had
been
removed
from
the
churches
and
everybody
was
being
sent
away
by
force
some
said
that
there
had
been
another
battle
after
borodino
in
which
the
french
had
been
crushed
some
said
that
on
the
contrary
the
whole
russian
army
had
been
annihilated
some
spoke
of
the
moscow
militia
going
to
the
three
hills
with
the
clergy
at
their
head
some
said
on
the
quiet
that
augustin
had
been
ordered
not
to
leave
that
some
traitors
had
been
caught
that
the
muzhiks
were
rioting
and
robbing
those
who
were
leaving
and
so
on
and
so
forth
but
that
was
only
talk
while
in
reality
both
those
who
were
leaving
and
those
who
were
staying
though
the
council
in
fili
at
which
it
was
decided
to
abandon
moscow
had
not
taken
place
yet
felt
though
without
showing
it
that
moscow
would
certainly
be
surrendered
and
that
they
had
to
take
themselves
away
as
soon
as
possible
and
save
their
possessions
they
felt
that
everything
was
suddenly
going
to
break
up
and
change
but
up
to
the
first
nothing
had
changed
yet
as
a
criminal
led
out
to
execution
knows
that
he
is
about
to
die
yet
still
looks
around
and
straightens
the
hat
he
has
put
on
askew
so
moscow
involuntarily
went
on
with
her
usual
life
though
she
knew
that
the
time
of
her
destruction
was
near
when
all
the
conventions
of
life
which
people
were
accustomed
to
obey
would
be
broken
in
the
course
of
those
three
days
that
preceded
the
capture
of
moscow
the
whole
rostov
family
found
themselves
bustling
in
various
ways
the
head
of
the
family
count
ilya
andreich
constantly
drove
around
town
gathering
the
rumors
that
came
from
all
sides
and
at
home
gave
generally
superficial
and
hasty
instructions
about
preparing
for
departure
the
countess
supervised
the
storing
of
things
was
displeased
with
everything
and
followed
after
petya
who
was
constantly
running
away
from
her
jealous
of
natasha
over
him
because
he
spent
all
his
time
with
her
sonya
alone
saw
to
the
practical
side
of
the
matter
the
packing
of
things
but
sonya
had
been
especially
sad
and
taciturn
all
the
time
recently
nicolass
letter
in
which
he
mentioned
princess
marya
had
provoked
the
countess
into
talking
joyfully
in
sonyas
presence
about
seeing
gods
providence
in
the
meeting
of
marya
and
nicolas
i
was
never
glad
said
the
countess
when
bolkonsky
was
natashas
fianc233
but
i
have
always
wished
and
have
a
presentiment
that
nikolenka
would
marry
the
princess
and
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
sonya
felt
that
that
was
true
that
the
only
possibility
of
mending
the
rostovs
affairs
was
marriage
to
a
rich
girl
and
the
princess
was
a
good
match
but
she
felt
very
bitter
in
spite
of
her
grief
or
maybe
precisely
because
of
it
she
took
upon
herself
all
the
difficulties
of
arranging
for
the
storing
and
packing
of
things
and
was
busy
all
day
long
the
count
and
countess
turned
to
her
when
they
needed
to
give
some
order
petya
and
natasha
on
the
contrary
not
only
did
not
help
their
parents
but
mostly
pestered
and
hindered
everyone
in
the
house
and
for
almost
the
whole
day
their
running
shouting
and
causeless
laughter
were
heard
in
the
house
they
laughed
and
made
merry
not
at
all
because
there
was
any
reason
for
laughter
but
their
souls
were
filled
with
joy
and
mirth
because
for
them
everything
that
happened
was
a
cause
of
joy
and
laughter
petya
was
merry
because
having
left
home
a
boy
he
had
returned
so
everyone
told
him
a
fine
man
he
was
merry
because
he
was
at
home
because
from
belaya
tserkov
where
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
into
battle
he
had
ended
up
in
moscow
where
there
would
be
fighting
any
day
and
above
all
he
was
merry
because
natasha
whose
moods
he
was
always
subject
to
was
merry
natasha
was
merry
because
she
had
been
sad
for
too
long
and
now
nothing
reminded
her
of
the
cause
of
her
sadness
and
she
was
in
good
health
she
was
also
merry
because
there
was
a
person
who
admired
her
the
admiration
of
others
was
that
grease
for
the
wheels
which
was
necessary
if
her
machine
was
to
run
perfectly
freely
and
petya
admired
her
and
above
all
they
were
merry
because
there
was
war
near
moscow
there
would
be
fighting
at
the
city
gates
weapons
were
being
distributed
everyone
was
fleeing
going
somewhere
and
in
general
something
extraordinary
was
happening
which
is
always
joyful
for
a
person
especially
a
young
one
xiii
on
saturday
the
thirtyfirst
of
august
everything
in
the
rostovs
house
seemed
turned
upside
down
all
the
doors
were
open
all
the
furniture
had
been
taken
out
or
moved
around
the
mirrors
and
paintings
had
been
taken
down
there
were
trunks
in
the
rooms
straw
wrapping
paper
and
string
lay
about
muzhiks
and
servants
carrying
things
out
tramped
heavily
over
the
parquet
floors
the
courtyard
was
crowded
with
peasant
carts
some
already
filled
to
the
top
and
tied
up
some
still
empty
the
voices
and
footsteps
of
the
huge
number
of
servants
and
of
the
muzhiks
coming
with
carts
rang
out
calling
to
each
other
in
the
courtyard
and
the
house
the
count
had
been
away
somewhere
since
morning
the
countess
who
had
a
headache
from
the
fuss
and
noise
lay
in
the
new
sitting
room
her
head
wrapped
in
a
cloth
with
vinegar
petya
was
not
at
home
he
had
gone
to
see
a
friend
with
whom
he
intended
to
transfer
from
the
militia
to
the
active
army
sonya
was
in
the
reception
room
seeing
to
the
packing
of
the
crystal
and
china
natasha
was
sitting
on
the
floor
in
her
devastated
room
amidst
the
scattered
dresses
ribbons
scarves
staring
fixedly
at
the
floor
holding
in
her
hands
an
old
ball
gown
the
same
one
already
out
of
fashion
in
which
she
had
gone
to
a
petersburg
ball
for
the
first
time
natasha
was
ashamed
to
be
doing
nothing
in
the
house
when
everybody
was
so
busy
and
since
morning
she
had
tried
several
times
to
do
something
but
her
heart
was
not
in
it
and
she
could
not
and
did
not
know
how
to
do
things
if
not
with
all
her
heart
with
all
her
might
she
stood
over
sonya
while
she
packed
the
china
wanted
to
help
but
abandoned
it
at
once
and
went
to
her
room
to
pack
her
own
things
at
first
she
amused
herself
by
giving
her
dresses
and
ribbons
to
the
maids
but
then
when
she
had
to
pack
the
rest
of
them
she
found
it
boring
dunyasha
darling
will
you
pack
yes
yes
and
when
dunyasha
willingly
promised
to
do
it
all
natasha
sat
on
the
floor
took
her
old
ball
gown
in
her
hands
and
fell
to
thinking
of
something
that
should
not
have
concerned
her
at
all
now
she
was
brought
out
of
her
reverie
by
the
talk
of
the
girls
in
the
maids
room
next
door
and
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
hurrying
from
the
room
to
the
back
porch
natasha
got
up
and
looked
out
the
window
in
the
street
an
enormous
train
of
wounded
had
stopped
the
girls
the
footmen
the
housekeeper
the
nanny
the
cooks
the
coachmen
the
postilions
the
scullions
were
standing
at
the
gates
looking
at
the
wounded
natasha
covered
her
hair
with
a
white
kerchief
and
holding
it
by
the
ends
with
both
hands
went
outside
their
former
housekeeper
old
mavra
kuzminishna
had
separated
from
the
crowd
that
stood
by
the
gate
and
going
up
to
a
cart
with
a
bast
hood
over
it
was
talking
with
a
pale
young
officer
who
lay
in
the
cart
natasha
took
several
steps
and
stopped
timidly
still
holding
her
kerchief
and
listening
to
what
the
housekeeper
was
saying
what
have
you
got
nobody
in
moscow
mavra
kuzminishna
was
saying
youd
be
more
comfortable
staying
somewherewith
us
even
the
masters
are
leaving
i
dont
know
if
its
allowed
the
officer
said
in
a
weak
voice
heres
my
superiorask
him
and
he
pointed
to
a
fat
major
who
was
coming
back
down
the
street
along
the
row
of
carts
natasha
peeked
with
frightened
eyes
into
the
wounded
officers
face
and
immediately
went
to
meet
the
major
may
the
wounded
stay
in
our
house
she
asked
the
major
put
his
hand
to
his
visor
with
a
smile
whom
do
you
want
mamzelle
he
said
narrowing
his
eyes
and
smiling
natasha
calmly
repeated
her
question
and
her
face
and
her
whole
manner
even
though
she
went
on
holding
her
kerchief
by
the
corners
were
so
serious
that
the
major
stopped
smiling
and
reflecting
at
first
as
if
asking
himself
to
what
extent
it
was
possible
replied
in
the
affirmative
oh
yes
why
not
they
may
he
said
natasha
inclined
her
head
slightly
and
with
quick
steps
returned
to
mavra
kuzminishna
who
was
standing
over
the
officer
talking
to
him
with
pitying
sympathy
they
may
he
says
they
may
natasha
said
in
a
whisper
the
officer
in
the
hooded
cart
turned
into
the
rostovs
courtyard
and
dozens
of
carts
with
wounded
at
the
invitation
of
the
towns
inhabitants
began
turning
into
the
yards
and
driving
up
to
the
entrances
of
houses
on
povarskaya
street
natasha
clearly
liked
these
relations
with
new
people
outside
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
together
with
mavra
kuzminishna
she
tried
to
get
as
many
of
the
wounded
as
possible
to
turn
into
their
courtyard
all
the
same
you
must
tell
your
father
said
mavra
kuzminishna
never

the
drawing
room
for
a
day

the
wings

spare
room
and
nannys
room

must
ask
well

then
natasha
ran
into
the
house
and
went
on
tiptoe
through
the
halfopen
door
to
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
smell
of
vinegar
and
hoffmanns
drops

the
countess

the

and
natasha
kissed
her
mother

up
and

reception
room
she
met
her
father
who
had

had
said
he
would
give
the
call
two
days
beforehand
the
orders
had
certainly
already
been
given
that
all
the
people
should
go
to
the
three
hills
tomorrow
with
their
weapons
and
a
major
battle
would
take
place
there
the
countess
kept
glancing
with
timid
horror
at
her
sons
merry
flushed
face
as
he
was
saying
that
she
knew
that
if
she
said
a
word
about
it
if
she
asked
petya
not
to
go
to
this
battle
she
knew
he
was
glad
of
this
impending
battle
he
would
say
something
about
men
honor
the
fatherlandsomething
senseless
masculine
obstinate
against
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
objectand
the
matter
would
be
spoiled
and
therefore
hoping
to
arrange
everything
so
as
to
leave
before
then
and
take
petya
along
as
a
defender
and
protector
she
said
nothing
to
petya
but
summoned
the
count
after
dinner
and
tearfully
implored
him
to
take
her
away
quickly
that
same
night
if
possible
with
the
involuntary
feminine
cunning
of
love
she
who
so
far
had
shown
perfect
fearlessness
said
that
she
would
die
of
fear
unless
they
left
that
night
she
was
afraid
of
everything
now
without
feigning
xiv
mme
schoss
who
had
gone
to
see
her
daughter
increased
the
countesss
fear
still
more
by
telling
her
what
she
had
seen
in
myasnitskaya
street
at
a
drinking
establishment
on
her
way
home
as
she
came
down
the
street
she
had
been
unable
to
reach
home
because
of
a
drunken
crowd
of
people
rioting
outside
the
establishment
she
had
hired
a
cab
and
come
home
by
a
back
lane
and
the
cabby
had
told
her
that
people
were
breaking
open
the
barrels
in
the
drinking
establishment
that
they
had
been
ordered
to
after
dinner
the
whole
rostov
household
with
enthusiastic
haste
got
to
work
packing
things
and
preparing
for
departure
the
old
count
suddenly
getting
to
work
after
dinner
kept
going
back
and
forth
from
the
yard
to
the
house
shouting
senselessly
at
the
hurrying
people
telling
them
to
hurry
still
more
petya
was
in
charge
in
the
courtyard
sonya
did
not
know
what
to
do
under
the
influence
of
the
counts
contradictory
orders
and
was
completely
at
a
loss
people
shouting
arguing
and
making
noise
rushed
about
the
rooms
and
the
courtyard
natasha
with
her
typical
passion
in
everything
also
suddenly
got
to
work
at
first
her
interference
in
the
work
of
packing
was
met
with
mistrust
everybody
expected
some
joke
from
her
and
did
not
want
to
obey
her
but
she
stubbornly
and
passionately
demanded
to
be
obeyed
became
angry
all
but
wept
that
they
did
not
listen
to
her
and
finally
got
them
to
believe
her
her
first
exploit
which
cost
her
enormous
effort
and
gave
her
power
was
packing
the
rugs
in
the
counts
house
there
were
costly
gobelin
tapestries
and
persian
carpets
when
natasha
got
down
to
work
there
were
two
open
crates
standing
in
the
reception
room
one
was
filled
almost
to
the
top
with
china
the
other
with
carpets
there
was
also
a
good
deal
of
china
standing
on
the
tables
and
more
was
being
brought
from
the
storeroom
a
new
third
crate
had
to
be
started
and
people
went
for
one
wait
sonya
well
be
able
to
fit
everything
in
said
natasha
its
impossible
miss
weve
already
tried
said
the
pantryman
no
please
wait
and
natasha
began
taking
the
dishes
and
plates
wrapped
in
paper
out
of
the
crate
the
dishes
ought
to
be
put
in
here
with
the
carpets
she
said
well
be
lucky
if
we
get
the
carpets
into
three
crates
as
it
is
said
the
pantryman
wait
please
and
natasha
quickly
deftly
began
sorting
things
those
we
dont
need
she
said
of
the
kievan
plates
these
yes
these
go
in
with
the
carpets
she
said
of
the
saxony
dishes
let
it
be
natasha
enough
now
well
pack
sonya
said
with
reproach
eh
miss
said
the
butler
but
natasha
did
not
give
in
threw
all
the
things
out
and
quickly
began
repacking
deciding
that
the
inferior
domestic
carpets
and
extra
dishes
should
not
be
taken
at
all
when
everything
had
been
taken
out
they
began
packing
again
and
indeed
having
discarded
almost
all
the
cheap
things
that
were
not
worth
taking
along
they
fitted
all
the
costly
things
into
two
crates
only
the
lid
of
the
carpet
crate
would
not
close
a
few
things
could
have
been
taken
out
but
natasha
insisted
on
having
her
way
she
packed
and
repacked
pressed
down
made
the
pantryman
and
petya
whom
she
drew
into
the
business
of
packing
press
down
on
the
lid
and
made
desperate
efforts
herself
enough
natasha
sonya
said
to
her
i
see
youre
right
just
take
out
the
one
on
top
i
dont
want
to
cried
natasha
holding
her
loosened
hair
away
from
her
sweaty
face
with
one
hand
and
pressing
down
on
the
carpets
with
the
other
press
on
it
petka
press
on
it
vassilyich
press
down
on
it
she
cried
the
carpets
got
pressed
down
and
the
lid
closed
natasha
clapped
her
hands
and
squealed
with
joy
and
tears
burst
from
her
eyes
but
that
lasted
only
a
second
she
at
once
took
up
another
task
and
now
they
trusted
her
fully
and
the
count
was
not
angry
when
he
was
told
that
natalya
ilyinichna
had
cancelled
his
order
and
the
servants
came
to
natasha
to
ask
if
they
should
tie
up
a
cart
or
not
and
was
it
sufficiently
loaded
the
work
went
swimmingly
owing
to
natashas
directions
the
unnecessary
things
were
left
and
the
most
costly
ones
were
packed
in
as
tightly
as
possible
but
however
everyone
bustled
by
late
at
night
they
could
not
get
everything
packed
the
countess
fell
asleep
and
the
count
having
postponed
their
departure
till
morning
went
to
bed
sonya
and
natasha
slept
in
the
sitting
room
without
undressing
that
night
one
more
wounded
man
was
transported
down
povarskaya
and
mavra
kuzminishna
who
was
standing
at
the
gate
had
him
turn
in
at
the
rostovs
this
wounded
man
was
to
mavra
kuzminishnas
mind
a
very
important
one
he
was
being
transported
in
a
caleche
with
the
apron
completely
closed
and
the
hood
down
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
sat
an
old
man
a
venerable
valet
a
doctor
and
two
soldiers
followed
behind
in
a
wagon
do
come
to
us
if
you
please
the
masters
are
leaving
the
whole
house
is
empty
said
the
old
woman
addressing
the
old
servant
why
not
the
valet
answered
sighing
we
dont
hope
to
make
it
we
have
our
own
house
in
moscow
but
its
far
and
theres
nobody
living
there
kindly
come
in
our
masters
have
plenty
of
everything
if
you
please
said
mavra
kuzminishna
what
is
he
very
unwell
she
added
the
valet
waved
his
hand
we
dont
hope
to
make
it
you
must
ask
the
doctor
and
the
valet
got
down
from
the
box
and
went
to
the
wagon
all
right
said
the
doctor
the
valet
came
back
to
the
caleche
looked
into
it
shook
his
head
told
the
driver
to
turn
into
the
courtyard
and
stopped
beside
mavra
kuzminishna
lord
jesus
christ
she
said
mavra
kuzminishna
suggested
that
the
wounded
man
be
taken
into
the
house
my
masters
wont
say
anything
she
said
but
they
had
to
avoid
carrying
him
upstairs
and
therefore
the
wounded
man
was
taken
to
the
wing
and
put
in
mme
schosss
former
room
this
wounded
man
was
prince
andrei
bolkonsky
xv
moscows
last
day
came
the
weather
was
clear
cheerful
autumnal
it
was
sunday
as
on
an
ordinary
sunday
the
bells
were
ringing
for
the
liturgy
in
all
the
churches
no
one
it
seemed
could
yet
grasp
what
was
in
store
for
moscow
only
two
indicators
of
the
condition
of
society
expressed
the
state
moscow
was
in
the
mob
that
is
the
estate
of
the
poor
and
the
prices
of
products
an
enormous
crowd
of
factory
workers
servants
and
muzhiks
mixed
with
clerks
seminarians
and
noblemen
went
out
to
the
three
hills
early
in
the
morning
of
that
day
they
stood
there
and
waited
in
vain
for
rastopchin
and
realizing
that
moscow
would
be
surrendered
this
crowd
dispersed
to
pothouses
and
taverns
all
over
moscow
the
prices
that
day
also
indicated
the
state
of
things
the
prices
of
weapons
gold
carts
and
horses
kept
going
up
while
the
prices
of
paper
money
and
city
things
kept
going
down
so
that
by
the
middle
of
the
day
there
were
occasions
when
cabbies
drove
off
with
expensive
goods
like
broadcloth
for
half
the
price
while
a
peasant
horse
was
sold
for
five
hundred
roubles
furniture
mirrors
bronze
objects
were
given
away
for
nothing
in
the
sedate
old
household
of
the
rostovs
the
breakdown
of
the
former
conditions
of
life
expressed
itself
very
faintly
in
regard
to
the
servants
the
only
thing
was
that
three
persons
from
the
enormous
staff
disappeared
during
the
night
but
nothing
was
stolen
and
in
regard
to
the
prices
of
things
it
turned
out
that
the
thirty
carts
that
had
come
from
their
country
estates
amounted
to
enormous
wealth
which
was
envied
by
many
and
for
which
the
rostovs
were
offered
enormous
sums
not
only
were
enormous
sums
offered
for
these
carts
but
in
the
evening
and
early
in
the
morning
of
the
first
of
september
orderlies
and
servants
sent
by
wounded
officers
kept
coming
to
the
rostovs
courtyard
and
wounded
men
placed
with
the
rostovs
and
neighbors
came
dragging
themselves
imploring
the
rostovs
servants
to
intercede
for
them
to
be
given
carts
in
order
to
leave
moscow
the
butler
to
whom
these
requests
were
addressed
though
he
pitied
the
wounded
resolutely
refused
saying
he
would
not
dare
even
inform
the
count
of
it
however
pitiful
these
abandoned
wounded
were
it
was
obvious
that
if
they
were
to
give
them
one
cart
there
would
be
no
reason
not
to
give
them
more
alland
their
own
carriages
as
well
thirty
carts
would
not
save
all
the
wounded
and
amidst
the
general
disaster
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
of
oneself
and
ones
own
family
so
the
butler
thought
for
his
master
waking
up
on
the
morning
of
the
first
count
ilya
andreich
quietly
left
the
bedroom
trying
not
to
wake
the
countess
who
had
fallen
asleep
only
towards
morning
and
in
his
purple
silk
dressing
gown
went
out
to
the
porch
the
tieddown
carts
stood
in
the
courtyard
by
the
porch
stood
the
carriages
the
butler
stood
by
the
entrance
talking
with
an
old
orderly
and
a
pale
young
officer
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
the
butler
seeing
the
count
gave
the
officer
and
the
orderly
a
meaningful
and
stern
sign
to
withdraw
well
is
everything
ready
vassilyich
said
the
count
rubbing
his
bald
pate
glancing
goodnaturedly
at
the
officer
and
the
orderly
and
nodding
to
them
the
count
liked
new
faces
we
can
hitch
up
at
once
your
excellency
well
thats
nice
the
countess
will
wake
up
and
god
speed
us
what
about
you
gentlemen
he
turned
to
the
officer
are
you
staying
in
my
house
the
officer
moved
closer
his
pale
face
suddenly
flushed
with
bright
color
do
me
a
favor
count
allow
mefor
gods
saketo
take
refuge
somewhere
on
one
of
your
carts
ive
got
nothing

me
ill

topit
wont
matter
before
the
officer
finished
the
orderly
came
up
to
the
count
with
the
same
request
for
his
master
ah
yes
yes
yes
the
count
said
quickly
ill
be
very
glad
to
vassilyich
arrange
it
so
that
one
or
two
carts
are
cleared
therewhateverwhatevers
necessary
the
count
said
ordering
something
in
some
sort
of
indefinite
terms
but
at
that
same
instant
the
ardent
expression
of
gratitude
from
the
officer
confirmed
what
he
had
ordered
the
count
looked
around
in
the
courtyard
in
the
gateway
in
the
windows
of
the
wing
wounded
men
and
orderlies
could
be
seen
they
were
all
looking
at
the
count
and
moving
towards
the
porch
if
you
please
your
excellency
come
to
the
gallery
what
are
your
instructions
concerning
the
paintings
said
the
butler
and
the
count
went
into
the
house
with
him
repeating
his
order
about
not
refusing
the
wounded
who
asked
to
ride
along
well
why
not
you
can
take
something
out
he
added
in
a
soft
secretive
voice
as
if
fearing
that
someone
might
overhear
him
at
nine
oclock
the
countess
woke
up
and
matryona
timofeevna
her
former
maid
who
carried
out
the
functions
of
a
police
chief
with
the
countess
came
to
report
to
her
former
young
lady
that
marya
karlovna
was
very
offended
and
that
the
young
ladies
summer
dresses
could
not
be
left
behind
on
the
countesss
inquiries
as
to
why
mme
schoss
was
offended
it
was
discovered
that
her
trunk
had
been
taken
off
the
cart
and
all
the
carts
were
being
untied
the
chattels
taken
out
and
wounded
men
put
in
whom
the
count
in
his
simplicity
had
ordered
to
be
taken
along
the
countess
ordered
her
husband
sent
for
what
is
it

the
hurry
the
count
said
this
timidly
as
he
always
spoke
when
it
had
to
do
with
money
the
countess
was
accustomed
to
this
tone
which
always
preceded
something
ruinous
for
their
children
like
some
sort
of
building
of
a
gallery
or
conservatory
the
organizing
of
a
home
theater
or
musical
performancesand
being
accustomed
to
it
she
considered
it
her
duty
always
to
fight
against
whatever
was
expressed
in
that
timid
tone
she
assumed
her
submissively
tearful
air
and
said
to
her
husband
listen

brought
it
to
the
point
that

that
everybody

something
to

the
way
a
certain
general
talking
about
it
in
his
presence

a
little
late
because
he
should
have
beaten

words
russian

ill
tell
you

that

hardly
restrain
those
thoseyes

courageous
and

he
said
in
a
rapid
patter
general

tolly
risked
his
life
everywhere
at
the
head
of
his
troops
i
can
tell
you
our
corps
was
stationed
on
the
side
of
a
hill
can
you
imagine
it
and
here
berg
told
everything
he
could
remember
from
various
stories
he
had
heard
since
that
time
natasha
not
taking
her
eyes
away
which
embarrassed
berg
looked
at
him
as
if
seeking
the
answer
to
some
question
in
his
face
in
general
such
heroism
as
the
russian
troops
displayed
is
impossible
to
imagine
and
praise
worthily
said
berg
glancing
at
natasha
and
smiling
at
her
as
if
trying
to
placate
her
in
response
to
her
stubborn
gazerussia
is
not
in
moscow
she
is
in
the
hearts
of
her
sons
right
papa
said
berg
just
then
the
countess
came
in
from
the
sitting
room
with
a
weary
and
displeased
air
berg
hastily
jumped
up
kissed
the
countesss
hand
asked
after
her
health
and
expressing
his
sympathy
with
a
wagging
of
the
head
stood
beside
her
yes

the
count
was
about

something
but
evidently
restrained
himself
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
door
berg
took
out
his
handkerchief
just
then
as
if
to
blow
his
nose
and
looking
at
the
knot
fell
to
thinking
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
significantly
i
have
a
big
favor
to
ask
of
you

he
said

the

laughing
the

out

went
in

there

this
little
chiffonier
and
a
dressing
table
you

how
verushka
wanted

and
how
we
argued
over
it
berg
involuntarily
passed
into
a
tone
of
joy
at
his
comfortable
life
when
he
began
talking
about
the
little
chiffonier
and
the
dressing
table
and
its
so

countess
began
to
cry

said
berg
natasha
left
with
her
father
and
as
if

difficulty
figuring
something
out
first
followed
after
him
then
ran
downstairs
petya
was
standing
on
the
porch
handing
out
weapons
to
the
servants
who
were
leaving
moscow
the
hitchedup
carts
were
still
standing
in
the
courtyard
two
of
them
had
been
unloaded
and
an
officer
supported
by
his
orderly
was
getting
into
one
of
them
do
you
know
why
petya
asked
natasha
natasha
understood
what
petya
meant
why
their
father
and
mother
had
quarreled
she
did
not
reply
because
papa
wanted
to
give
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
said
petya

natasha
suddenly

my
opinion
this

so
vile
so
loathsome
soi
dont

some
sort
of
germans
her
throat
trembled
with
convulsive
sobs
and
afraid
of
weakening
and
expending
the
charge
of
her
anger
for
nothing
she
turned
and
rushed
precipitously
up
the
stairs
berg
was
sitting
by
the
countess
and
with
respectful
intimacy
was
trying
to
comfort
her
the
count
was
pacing
the
room
with
his
pipe
in
his
hands
when
natasha
her
face
distorted
by
anger
stormed
into
the
room
and
with
quick
steps
went
up
to
her
mother
this
is
vile
this
is
loathsome
she
shouted
it
cant
be
that
you
ordered
it
berg
and
the
countess
looked
at
her
in
perplexity
and
fear
the
count
stopped
by
the
window
listening

the
count
stood
by
the
window
and
without
turning
his
face
listened
to
natashas
words
suddenly
he
snuffed
his
nose
and
brought
his
face
close
to
the
window
the
countess
glanced
at
her
daughter
saw
her
face
ashamed
for
her
mother
saw
her
agitation
understood
why
her
husband
did
not
turn
to
look
at
her
now
and
glanced
around
her
with
a
lost
air
ah

as
you
like
as
if
im
hindering
anybody
she
said
still
not
surrendering
outright
mama
darling

me
but
the
countess
pushed
her
daughter
aside
and
went
up
to
the
count
mon
cher

things
she
said
lowering
her
eyes
guiltily
the
eggsthe
eggs
are
teaching
the
hen
the
count
said
through
happy
tears
and
he
embraced
his
wife
who
was
glad
to
hide
her
ashamed
face
on
his
chest
papa
mama
may

orders

i
asked
natasha
well

the
most
necessary
things
anyway
she
said
the
count
nodded
affirmatively
to
her
and
natasha
running
quickly
as
she
used
to
run
when
playing
blindmans
buff
rushed
through
the
reception
room
to
the
front
hall
down
the
steps
and
into
the
courtyard
people
gathered
around
natasha
and
could
not
believe
the
strange
instructions
she
gave
them
until
the
count
himself
in
his
wifes
name
confirmed
the
instructions
to
hand
over
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
and
put
the
trunks
in
the
storerooms
once
they
understood
the
instructions
the
people
joyful
and
bustling
got
down
to
the
new
task
now
the
servants
not
only
did
not
find
it
strange
but
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
as
though
it
could
not
be
otherwise
just
as
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
not
only
had
no
one
found
it
strange
that
the
wounded
should
be
left
behind
and
objects
taken
along
but
it
had
seemed
as
though
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
whole
household
as
if
making
up
for
not
having
done
it
earlier
began
bustling
about
the
new
task
of
accommodating
the
wounded
the
wounded
crawled
out
of
their
rooms
and
with
pale
joyful
faces
surrounded
the
carts
rumor
also
reached
the
neighboring
houses
that
there
were
carts
available
and
the
wounded
from
other
houses
started
coming
to
the
rostovs
courtyard
many
of
the
wounded
asked
them
not
to
unload
the
things
but
just
to
sit
them
on
top
but
once
begun
the
business
of
dumping
things
could
not
be
stopped
it
made
no
difference
whether
everything
was
left
or
only
half
the
courtyard
was
strewn
with
the
trunks
of
dishes
bronzes
paintings
and
mirrors
that
had
been
so
carefully
packed
the
night
before
and
people
were
still
seeking
and
finding
possibilities
for
unloading
one
thing
or
another
and
providing
more
and
more
carts

can
take
four
more
said
the
steward

the
countess

in
the
carriage
with
me
the
wardrobe
cart
was
handed
over
and
sent
to
fetch
some
wounded
men
two
houses
away
all
the
household
and
the
servants
were
cheerfully
animated
natasha
was
in
a
state
of
rapturously
happy
animation
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time
where

we
tie
it
on
asked
the
servants
trying
to
fix
a
trunk

the
narrow
tailboard
of
the
carriage

box
petya
cried
natasha
sonya
also
bustled
about
constantly
but
the
goal
of
her
bustling
was
the
opposite
of
natashas
she
was
putting
away
the
things
that
had
to
be
left
behind
she
made
a
list
of
them
as
the
countess
wished
and
tried
to
take
along
as
much
as
possible
xvii
towards
two
oclock
the
rostovs
four
carriages
harnessed
and
packed
stood
by
the
entrance
the
carts
of
wounded
were
driving
out
of
the
courtyard
one
after
another
the
caleche
in
which
prince
andrei
was
being
transported
driving
past
the
porch
caught
the
attention
of
sonya
who
along
with
a
maid
was
arranging
a
seat
for
the
countess
in
her
enormous
high
carriage
which
stood
by
the
entrance
whose
caleche
is
that
asked
sonya
leaning
out
the
window
of
the
carriage
dont
you
know
miss
the
maid
replied
the
wounded
prince

the

the
maid
answered
with
a
sigh
they
say

sonya
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
and
ran
to
the
countess
the
countess
already
dressed
for
traveling
in
a
shawl
and
a
hat
tired
out
was
pacing
the
drawing
room
waiting
for
the
household
so
as
to
sit
with
the
door
closed
and
pray
before
their
departure
natasha
was
not
in
the
room
maman
said
sonya
prince
andrei

going
with

the
countess
opened
her
eyes
fearfully
and
seizing
sonyas
hand
looked
around
natasha
she
said
for
both
sonya
and
the
countess
this
news
had
in
the
first
moment
only
one
meaning
they
knew
their
natasha
and
the
dread
of
what
would
happen
to
her
at
this
news
stifled
in
them
any
sympathy
for
the
man
whom
they
both
liked
natasha
doesnt
know
yet
but
hes
going
with
us
said
sonya
you
say
hes
dying
sonya
nodded
her
head
the
countess
embraced
sonya
and
wept
the
ways
of
god
are
inscrutable
she
thought
feeling
that
in
all
that
was
now
happening
an
almighty
hand
which
had
previously
been
hidden
from
peoples
eyes
was
beginning
to
show
well
mama
everythings
ready

matter
natasha
asked
running
into
the
room
with
an
animated
look
nothing
said
the
countess
everythings
ready
so
lets
go
and
the
countess
bent
over
her
reticule
to
hide
her
upset
face
sonya
embraced
natasha
and
kissed
her
natasha
looked
at
her
questioningly
whats
wrong
whats

something
very
bad

the
sensitive
natasha
asked
sonya
sighed
and
said
nothing
the
count
petya
mme
schoss
mavra
kuzminishna
and
vassilyich
came
into
the
drawing
room
and
having
closed
the
door
they
all
sat
down
and
silently
not
looking
at
each
other
remained
seated
for
several
seconds
the
count
got
up
first
and
with
a
loud
sigh
began
crossing
himself
before
the
icon
they
all
did
the
same
then
the
count
began
to
embrace
mavra
kuzminishna
and
vassilyich
who
were
to
remain
in
moscow
and
while
they
tried
to
take
hold
of
his
hand
and
kissed
his
shoulder
he
patted
them
lightly
on
the
back
murmuring
something
vague
and
tenderly
soothing
the
countess
went
to
the
icon
room
and
sonya
found
her
there
kneeling
before
the
few
remaining
icons
that
hung
here
and
there
on
the
wall
the
icons
most
precious
for
the
familys
past
they
brought
with
them
on
the
porch
and
in
the
courtyard
the
servants
who
were
leaving
armed
by
petya
with
daggers
and
swords
their
trousers
tucked
into
their
boots
and
tightly
girded
with
belts
and
sashes
were
saying
goodbye
to
those
who
were
staying
as
is
usual
during
a
departure
many
things
were
forgotten
or
wrongly
packed
and
for
some
time
two
liveried
postilions
stood
on
either
side
of
the
open
door
and
steps
of
the
carriage
ready
to
help
the
countess
in
while
maids
ran
about
with
pillows
and
bundles
from
the
house
to
the
carriages
the
caleche
the
britzka
and
back
they
eternally
forget
everything
said
the
countess
why
you
know
i
cant
sit
like
that
and
dunyasha
clenching
her
teeth
and
not
replying
with
an
expression
of
reproach
on
her
face
rushed
into
the
carriage
to
rearrange
the
seat
ah
these
folk
said
the
count
shaking
his
head
the
old
coachman
efim
who
was
the
only
one
with
whom
the
countess
would
venture
to
ride
sitting
high
up
on
the
box
did
not
even
turn
to
look
at
what
was
happening
behind
him
he
knew
with
his
thirty
years
of
experience
that
it
would
be
a
while
before
they
told
him
godspeed
and
that
once
they
had
told
him
they
would
stop
him
twice
more
and
send
for
things
they
had
forgotten
and
after
that
would
stop
him
once
again
and
the
countess
herself
would
stick
her
head
out
and
beg
him
in
christs
name
to
drive
more
carefully
on
the
descents
he
knew
it
and
therefore
waited
for
what
was
to
come
more
patiently
than
his
horses
especially
the
chestnut
on
the
left
sokol
who
pawed
the
ground
and
champed
at
the
bit
at
last
everybody
was
seated
the
steps
were
folded
and
flipped
back
into
the
carriage
the
door
banged
shut
the
strongbox
was
sent
for
the
countess
leaned
out
and
said
what
she
ought
then
efim
slowly
took
off
his
hat
and
began
crossing
himself
the
postilion
and
all
the
servants
did
the
same
godspeed
said
efim
putting
on
his
hat
whip
em
up
the
postilion
started
the
horses
the
right
trace
horse
lunged
into
the
collar
the
high
springs
creaked
and
the
body
rocked
a
footman
jumped
up
on
the
box
in
motion
the
carriage
jolted
as
it
drove
out
of
the
courtyard
onto
the
bumpy
pavement
the
other
equipages
jolted
in
the
same
way
and
the
train
started
up
the
street
everyone
in
the
carriages
the
caleche
and
the
britzka
crossed
themselves
before
the
church
across
the
street
those
staying
in
moscow
walked
on
both
sides
of
the
equipages
seeing
them
off
natasha
had
rarely
experienced
such
a
joyful
feeling
as
she
experienced
now
sitting
in
the
carriage
next
to
the
countess
and
gazing
at
the
walls
slowly
moving
past
her
of
alarmed
abandoned
moscow
she
occasionally
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
looked
up
and
down
the
long
train
of
wounded
that
preceded
them
almost
at
the
head
of
it
she
could
see
the
closed
top
of
prince
andreis
caleche
she
did
not
know
who
was
in
it
and
each
time
she
looked
over
the
extent
of
her
train
she
sought
that
caleche
with
her
eyes
she
knew
it
was
at
the
head
of
them
all
from
nikitskaya
from
presnia
from
podnovinsky
boulevard
several
trains
like
the
rostovs
came
together
in
kudrino
and
now
two
lines
of
carriages
drove
down
sadovaya
driving
around
the
sukhareva
tower
natasha
who
was
curiously
and
quickly
studying
the
people
driving
and
walking
by
suddenly
cried
out
with
joyful
surprise
good
heavens
mama
sonya
look
its
him
who
who
look
for
gods
sake
its
bezukhov
said
natasha
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
gazing
at
a
tall
fat
man
in
a
coachmans
kaftan
obviously
a
disguised
gentleman
by
his
gait
and
bearing
who
side
by
side
with
a
sallow
beardless
little
old
man
in
a
frieze
overcoat
was
walking
out
from
under
the
archway
of
the
sukhareva
tower
by
god
its
bezukhov
in
a
kaftan
with
some
sort
of
little
old
boy
by
god
natasha
said
look
look
no
its
not
him
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
mama
natasha
shouted
its
him
ill
bet
you
anything
i
assure
you
wait
wait
she
shouted
to
the
driver
but
the
driver
could
not
stop
because
more
carts
and
carriages
were
driving
out
of
meshchanskaya
street
and
they
were
shouting
at
the
rostovs
to
move
on
and
not
hold
up
others
indeed
though
now
much
further
away
than
before
all
the
rostovs
saw
pierre
or
a
man
extraordinarily
like
pierre
in
a
coachmans
kaftan
walking
down
the
street
with
a
bowed
head
and
a
serious
face
beside
a
little
beardless
old
man
who
looked
like
a
footman
the
little
old
man
noticed
a
face
thrust
out
at
him
from
the
carriage
and
respectfully
touching
pierres
elbow
said
something
to
him
pointing
at
the
carriage
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
so
immersed
he
obviously
was
in
his
thoughts
when
he
finally
understood
him
he
looked
in
the
direction
he
was
pointing
in
and
recognizing
natasha
yielded
to
his
first
impression
that
same
second
and
quickly
made
for
the
carriage
but
having
gone
some
ten
steps
he
evidently
remembered
something
and
stopped
natashas
face
thrust
out
of
the
carriage
window
beamed
with
mocking
tenderness
pyotr
kirilych
come
here
we
recognized
you
its
astonishing
she
shouted
giving
him
her
hand
how
can
it
be
why
are
you
like
this
pierre
took
the
hand
held
out
to
him
and
clumsily
in
motion
since
the
carriage
went
on
moving
kissed
it
whats
the
matter
with
you
count
the
countess
asked
in
an
astonished
and
commiserating
voice
what
what
why
dont
ask
me
said
pierre
and
he
glanced
at
natasha
whose
radiant
joyful
gaze
he
felt
it
without
glancing
at
her
poured
its
loveliness
upon
him
but
youre
not
staying
in
moscow
are
you
pierre
was
silent
for
a
moment
in
moscow
he
said
questioningly
yes
in
moscow
goodbye
ah

wish
i
were
a
man
id
certainly

with
you
ah

good
said
natasha
mama
please

pierre
looked
distractedly
at
natasha
and
was
about
to
say
something
but
the
countess
interrupted
him
you
were
in
the
battle
weve
heard
yes

he
began
but
natasha
interrupted
him

look

ah

goodbye
goodbye
he
said
terrible
times
and
dropping
behind
the
carriage
he
went
back
to
the
sidewalk
natasha
leaned
out
of
the
window
for
a
long
time
beaming
at
him
with
her
tender
and
slightly
mocking
joyful
smile
xviii
pierre
since
disappearing
from
his
house
had
been
living
for
two
days
in
the
empty
apartment
of
the
late
bazdeev
here
is
how
it
happened
on
waking
up
the
day
after
his
return
to
moscow
and
his
meeting
with
count
rastopchin
pierre
could
not
understand
for
a
long
time
where
he
was
and
what
was
wanted
of
him
when
among
the
names
of
other
persons
waiting
for
him
in
the
waiting
room
he
was
told
there
was
also
a
frenchman
who
had
brought
a
letter
from
countess
elena
vassilievna
he
was
suddenly
overcome
by
that
feeling
of
confusion
and
hopelessness
he
was
apt
to
succumb
to
he
suddenly
imagined
that
everything
was
over
now
everything
was
mixed
up
everything
was
destroyed
that
no
one
was
right
or
wrong
that
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
future
and
there
was
no
way
out
of
this
situation
smiling
unnaturally
and
muttering
something
he
sat
on
the
sofa
in
a
helpless
pose
then
got
up
went
to
the
door
peeked
through
the
crack
into
the
waiting
room
then
waving
his
hands
went
back
and
picked
up
a
book
the
butler
came
for
a
second
time
to
inform
pierre
that
the
frenchman
who
had
brought
the
letter
from
the
countess
wished
very
much
to
see
him
at
least
for
a
moment
and
that
someone
had
come
from
the
widow
of
i
a
bazdeev
asking
him
to
take
the
books
since
mrs
bazdeev
herself
had
left
for
the
country
ah
yes
at
once
wait
a
momentor
nono
go
and
tell
them
ill
come
at
once
pierre
said
to
the
butler
but
as
soon
as
the
butler
left
pierre
took
his
hat
which
was
lying
on
the
table
and
left
by
the
back
door
of
his
study
there
was
no
one
in
the
corridor
pierre
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
corridor
to
the
stairway
and
wincing
and
rubbing
his
forehead
with
both
hands
went
down
to
the
firstfloor
landing
the
porter
was
standing
by
the
front
door
from
the
landing
where
pierre
stood
another
stairway
led
to
the
back
door
pierre
went
down
it
and
walked
out
to
the
courtyard
no
one
had
seen
him
but
in
the
street
as
soon
as
he
went
out
the
gate
the
coachmen
who
were
standing
by
the
carriages
and
the
caretaker
saw
their
master
and
took
their
hats
off
to
him
feeling
their
gazes
directed
at
him
pierre
behaved
like
an
ostrich
which
hides
its
head
in
a
bush
so
as
not
to
be
seen
he
lowered
his
head
and
quickening
his
pace
went
down
the
street
of
all
the
matters
that
faced
pierre
that
morning
to
him
the
most
important
seemed
to
be
sorting
the
books
and
papers
of
iosif
alexeevich
he
took
the
first
cab
that
came
along
and
told
the
driver
to
take
him
to
the
patriarchs
ponds
where
the
widow
bazdeevs
house
was
glancing
constantly
at
the
carts
of
those
leaving
moscow
which
were
moving
on
all
sides
and
shifting
his
fat
body
so
as
not
to
slip
off
the
old
rattling
droshky
pierre
experiencing
a
joyful
feeling
similar
to
that
experienced
by
a
boy
who
has
run
away
from
school
fell
to
talking
with
the
cabby
the
cabby
told
him
that
weapons
were
being
distributed
that
day
in
the
kremlin
and
that
the
next
day
the
people
would
all
be
driven
out
of
the
three
hills
gate
and
there
would
be
a
big
battle
having
reached
the
patriarchs
ponds
pierre
found
bazdeevs
house
where
he
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
he
went
to
the
gate
gerasim
the
same
sallow
beardless
little
old
man
whom
pierre
had
seen
five
years
before
in
torzhok
with
iosif
alexeevich
came
out
to
his
knocking
is
the
lady

the
old
servant
makar
alexeevich

as
pierre

the
halfmad
brother
of
iosif
alexeevich
and
given
to
heavy
drinking
yes
yes
i
know
lets

go
said
pierre
and
he
went
into
the
house
a
tall
bald
old
man
in
a
dressing
gown
with
a
red
nose
and
galoshes
on
his
bare
feet
was
standing
in
the
front
hall
seeing
pierre
he
angrily
muttered
something
and
went
to
the
corridor
he
was
a
great
mind
but
now
if
you
please
look
how
feeble
hes
become
said
gerasim
would
you
like
to
go
to
the
study
pierre
nodded
the
study
has
stayed
the
way
it
was
when
it
was
first
sealed
sofya
danilovna
ordered
that
if
someone
came
from
you
he
was
to
be
given
the
books
pierre
entered
the
same
gloomy
study
he
used
to
enter
with
such
awe
while
his
benefactor
was
alive
this
study
dusty
and
untouched
since
iosif
alexeevichs
demise
was
gloomier
still
gerasim
opened
one
shutter
and
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
pierre
walked
around
the
study
went
to
the
bookcase
in
which
the
manuscripts
lay
and
took
out
what
had
once
been
one
of
the
most
important
sacred
objects
of
the
order
these
were
the
authentic
scottish
charters
with
his
benefactors
notes
and
commentaries
he
sat
down
at
the
dusty
writing
table
and
placed
the
manuscripts
before
him
opened
them
closed
them
and
finally
moving
them
aside
propped
his
head
in
his
hands
and
lapsed
into
thought
gerasim
cautiously
peeked
into
the
study
several
times
and
saw
pierre
sitting
in
the
same
position
more
than
two
hours
went
by
gerasim
allowed
himself
to
make
some
noise
by
the
door
so
as
to
attract
pierres
attention
pierre
did
not
hear
him
do
you
wish
me
to
dismiss
the
cabby
ah
yes
said
pierre
coming
to
his
senses
and
hastening
to
stand
up
listen
he
said
taking
gerasim
by
the
button
of
his
frock
coat
and
looking
down
on
the
old
man
with
shining
moist
rapturous
eyes
listen
do
you
know
that
there
will
be
a
battle
tomorrow
theres
been
talk
of
it
replied
gerasim
i
ask
you
to
tell
no
one
who
i
am
and
to
do
what
i
tell
you
yes
sir
said
gerasim
do
you
wish
to
be
served
some
food
no
but
i
need
something
else
i
need
peasant
clothes
and
a
pistol
said
pierre
suddenly
blushing
yes
sir
said
gerasim
after
a
moments
thought
all
the
rest
of
that
day
pierre
spent
alone
in
his
benefactors
study
pacing
restlessly
as
gerasim
could
hear
from
one
corner
to
the
other
talking
to
himself
and
he
spent
the
night
on
a
bed
made
up
for
him
there
gerasim
with
the
habit
of
a
servant
who
had
seen
all
sorts
of
strange
things
in
his
life
accepted
pierres
moving
in
without
surprise
and
seemed
pleased
that
he
had
someone
to
serve
that
same
evening
without
even
asking
himself
what
they
were
needed
for
he
obtained
a
kaftan
and
hat
for
pierre
and
promised
to
get
the
requested
pistol
the
next
day
that
evening
makar
alexeevich
shuffling
in
his
galoshes
twice
came
to
the
door
and
stopped
looking
ingratiatingly
at
pierre
but
as
soon
as
pierre
turned
to
him
he
bashfully
and
angrily
wrapped
his
dressing
gown
around
him
and
hastily
retreated
it
was
when
pierre
in
a
coachmans
kaftan
acquired
and
steamcleaned
for
him
by
gerasim
was
going
with
him
to
buy
a
pistol
near
the
sukhareva
tower
that
he
met
the
rostovs
xix
on
the
night
of
the
first
of
september
kutuzovs
order
was
given
for
the
retreat
of
the
russian
troops
through
moscow
to
the
ryazan
road
the
first
troops
set
out
at
night
the
troops
moving
by
night
did
not
hurry
and
moved
slowly
and
measuredly
but
at
dawn
the
moving
troops
approaching
the
dorogomilovo
bridge
saw
ahead
of
them
on
this
side
endless
masses
of
troops
crowding
hurrying
over
the
bridge
and
on
the
other
side
climbing
up
and
clogging
the
streets
and
lanes
while
more
troops
were
pressing
behind
them
and
they
were
seized
by
a
groundless
haste
and
anxiety
they
all
rushed
ahead
towards
the
bridge
onto
the
bridge
to
the
fords
and
into
the
boats
kutuzov
had
ordered
himself
taken
around
by
the
back
streets
to
the
other
side
of
moscow
by
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
september
only
the
troops
of
the
rear
guard
remained
at
large
in
the
dorogomilovo
suburb
the
army
was
already
on
the
other
side
of
moscow
and
beyond
moscow
at
that
same
time
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
september
napoleon
was
standing
among
his
troops
on
poklonnaya
hill
and
looking
at
the
spectacle
spread
out
before
him
beginning
with
the
twentysixth
of
august
and
until
the
second
of
september
from
the
battle
of
borodino
to
the
enemys
entry
into
moscow
in
all
the
days
of
that
anxious
memorable
week
there
had
been
that
extraordinary
autumn
weather
always
astonishing
for
people
when
the
low
sun
gives
more
heat
than
in
spring
when
everything
glistens
in
the
rarefied
clear
air
so
that
the
eyes
hurt
when
the
chest
feels
stronger
and
fresher
inhaling
the
fragrant
autumn
air
when
even
the
nights
are
warm
and
when
in
those
dark
warm
nights
the
sky
frightening
and
gladdening
ceaselessly
pours
down
golden
stars
on
the
second
of
september
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
the
weather
was
like
that
the
brilliance
of
the
morning
was
magical
moscow
from
poklonnaya
hill
spread
out
spaciously
with
its
river
its
gardens
and
churches
and
seemed
to
be
living
its
life
its
cupolas
glittering
like
stars
in
the
sunlight
at
the
sight
of
the
strange
city
with
the
neverseen
forms
of
its
extraordinary
architecture
napoleon
experienced
that
somewhat
envious
and
restless
curiosity
which
people
experience
at
the
sight
of
alien
forms
of
life
that
know
nothing
of
them
obviously
this
city
lived
with
all
the
forces
of
its
own
life
by
those
indefinable
signs
which
even
from
a
distance
unmistakably
distinguish
a
living
body
from
a
dead
one
napoleon
saw
from
poklonnaya
hill
the
quivering
of
life
in
the
city
and
felt
as
it
were
the
breathing
of
that
big
and
beautiful
body
every
russian
looking
at
moscow
feels
that
she
is
a
mother
every
foreigner
looking
at
her
and
not
knowing
her
maternal
significance
must
feel
the
feminine
character
of
this
city
and
napoleon
felt
it
cette
ville
asiatique
aux
innombrables
233glises
moscou
la
sainte
la
voil224
donc
enfin
cette
fameuse
ville
il
233tait
temps
said
napoleon
and
getting
off
his
horse
he
ordered
a
map
of
this
moscou
spread
out
before
him
and
summoned
the
interpreter
lelorgne
dideville
une
ville
occup233e
par
lennemi
ressemble
224
une
fille
qui
a
perdu
son
honneur
he
thought
as
he
had
also
said
to
tuchkov
in
smolensk
and
from
that
point
of
view
he
looked
for
the
first
time
upon
the
oriental
beauty
lying
before
him
it
was
strange
for
him
that
his
longstanding
wish
which
had
seemed
impossible
had
finally
been
fulfilled
in
the
clear
morning
light
he
looked
now
at
the
city
now
at
the
map
checking
the
details
of
the
city
and
the
certainty
of
possession
excited
and
awed
him
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
he
thought
here
it
is
this
capital
at
my
feet
awaiting
her
destiny
where
is
alexander
now
and
what
is
he
thinking
a
strange
beautiful
majestic
city
and
a
strange
and
majestic
moment
in
what
light
do
they
see
me
he
thought
of
his
troops
here
it
is
the
reward
for
all
those
of
little
faith
he
thought
looking
at
his
retinue
and
at
the
troops
approaching
and
forming
up
one
word
from
me
one
movement

i

will
take
precisely
that
most
painfully
of
alli
know
him
it
seemed
to
napoleon
that
the
main
significance
of
what
was
happening
lay
in
his
personal
struggle
with
alexander
from
the
heights
of

yes
thats
the

will
give

the

i
will
show

the
meaning
of
true
civilization
i
will
make
the
generations
of
boyars
remember
the
name
of
their
conqueror
with
love
i
will
tell
their
deputation
that
i
did
not
and
do
not
want

that
i
have
waged
war
only
with
the
faulty
policy
of

that
i
love
and
respect
alexander
and
that
i
will
accept
conditions

peace
in
moscow
which
are
worthy
of
me
and
of
my
people
i
do
not
want
to
use
the
fortunes
of

to
humiliate
a
respected

i
will
say
to
them
i
do
not
want
war
i
want
peace
and
the
wellbeing
of
all
my
subjects
however
i
know
that
their
presence
will
inspire
me
and
i
will
speak
to
them
as
i
always
do
clearly
solemnly
and
grandly

can
it

he
turned
to
his
suite
a
general
with
a
brilliant
suite
galloped
off
at
once
for
the
boyars
two
hours
went
by
napoleon
had
lunch
and
again
stood
in
the
same
place
on
poklonnaya
hill
waiting
for
the
deputation
his
speech
to
the
boyars
had
already
taken
clear
shape
in
his
imagination
this
speech
was
filled
with
dignity
and
with
grandeur
as
napoleon
understood
it
he
himself
was
carried
away
by
the
tone
of
magnanimity
he
intended
to
employ
in
moscow
in
his
imagination
he
appointed
days
for
the
r233union
dans
le
palais
des
czars
where
russian
dignitaries
would
get
together
with
the
dignitaries
of
the
french
emperor
he
mentally
appointed
a
governor
who
would
be
able
to
attract
the
populace
to
him
having
learned
that
there
were
many
charitable
institutions
in
moscow
he
decided
in
his
imagination
that
all
those
institutions
would
be
showered
with
his
favors
he
thought
that
as
in
africa
he
had
had
to
sit
in
a
burnous
in
a
mosque
so
in
moscow
he
had
to
be
merciful
like
the
tsars
and
so
as
to
definitively
touch
the
hearts
of
the
russians
he
like
all
frenchmen
who
could
not
imagine
anything
sentimental
without
mentioning
ma

would

he
decided
to
himself
but
can
it
be
that
im
in
moscow
yes
there
she
is
in
front
of
me
but
why
is
the
deputation
from
the
city
so
long
in
appearing
he
thought
meanwhile
at
the
back
of
the
emperors
suite
a
worried
debate
was
going
on
in
whispers
among
his
generals
and
marshals
those
sent
for
the
deputation
had
come
back
with
the
news
that
moscow
was
empty
that
everyone
had
left
the
faces
of
the
debating
men
were
pale
and
worried
they
were
frightened
not
by
the
fact
that
moscow
had
been
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
important
as
that
event
might
seem
but
by
how
to
announce
it
to
the
emperor
how
without
putting
his
majesty
into
that
dreadful
position
known
to
the
french
as
le
ridicule
to
announce
to
him
that
he
had
been
awaiting
the
boyars
so
long
for
nothing
that
there
were
crowds
of
drunken
men
and
nothing
else
some
said
that
at
least
some
sort
of
deputation
had
to
be
assembled
others
argued
against
that
opinion
and
insisted
that
they
had
to
prepare
the
emperor
cautiously
and
intelligently
and
tell
him
the
truth
il
faudra
le
lui
dire
tout
de
m234me
said
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
mais
messieurs
the
situation
was
the
more
difficult
in
that
the
emperor
thinking
over
his
plans
for
magnanimity
was
patiently
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
map
occasionally
glancing
from
under
his
hand
at
the
road
to
moscow
and
smiling
cheerfully
and
proudly
mais
cest
impossible
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
said
shrugging
their
shoulders
not
daring
to
utter
the
terrible
word
in
their
minds
le
ridicule
meanwhile
the
emperor
tired
of
vainly
waiting
and
sensing
with
his
actors
intuition
that
the
majestic
moment
having
gone
on
too
long
was
beginning
to
lose
its
majesty
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
the
solitary
shot
of
a
signal
gun
rang
out
and
the
troops
that
surrounded
moscow
on
all
sides
moved
into
the
city
through
the
tver
kaluga
and
dorogomilovo
gates
quicker
and
quicker
overtaking
each
other
the
troops
moved
at
a
rapid
walk
or
at
a
trot
disappearing
in
the
clouds
of
dust
they
raised
and
filling
the
air
with
the
merging
noise
of
their
cries
drawn
along
by
the
movement
of
the
troops
napoleon
went
with
them
as
far
as
the
dorogomilovo
gate
but
there
stopped
again
and
getting
off
his
horse
paced
for
a
long
time
by
the
kamerkollezhsky
rampart
awaiting
the
deputation
xx
meanwhile
moscow
was
empty
there
were
still
people
in
it
there
was
still
a
fiftieth
all
the
former
inhabitants
left
in
it
but
it
was
empty
it
was
empty
as
a
dyingout
queenless
beehive
is
empty
there
is
no
life
in
a
queenless
beehive
but
to
a
superficial
glance
it
seems
as
alive
as
the
others
in
the
hot
rays
of
the
noonday
sun
the
bees
hover
just
as
merrily
around
a
queenless
hive
as
around
the
other
living
hives
from
afar
it
has
the
same
smell
of
honey
bees
fly
in
and
out
of
it
in
the
same
way
but
we
need
only
take
a
closer
look
at
it
to
realize
that
there
is
no
longer
any
life
in
this
hive
the
bees
do
not
fly
in
the
same
way
as
in
a
living
hive
the
smell
is
not
the
same
it
is
not
the
same
sound
that
strikes
the
beekeepers
ear
to
the
beekeepers
tapping
on
the
wall
of
an
ailing
hive
instead
of
the
former
instantaneous
concerted
response
the
hissing
of
tens
of
thousands
of
bees
menacingly
tucking
their
behinds
under
and
producing
this
vital
airy
sound
by
the
rapid
beating
of
their
wings
there
comes
in
response
a
scattered
buzzing
that
resonates
at
various
points
of
the
empty
hive
the
entrance
does
not
give
out
as
before
a
spiritous
fragrant
smell
of
honey
and
venom
no
feeling
of
the
warmth
of
fullness
comes
from
it
but
the
smell
of
honey
is
mingled
with
a
smell
of
emptiness
and
rot
at
the
entrance
there
are
no
more
sentinels
ready
to
defend
it
to
the
death
their
behinds
turned
up
sounding
the
alarm
there
is
no
longer
that
measured
and
quiet
sound
the
throb
of
work
like
the
sound
of
seething
water
but
one
hears
the
discordant
scattered
noise
of

formerly
only

flew

now
laden

out
the
beekeeper
opens
the
lower
chamber
and
peers
into
the
lower
the
hive
instead
of
the
black
strands
of
juicy
bees
pacified
by
labor
that
formerly
hung
down
to
the
very
bottom
holding
each

legs
and
drawing
out
the

with
an
incessant
whisper

wander
absentmindedly
in

over

neatly
plastered
with

swept
by

is
covered
with

grumbling
is
occasionally
heard
from

sides
in

place
two
bees
cleaning
the

by

and

assiduous

the

slowly
lightly
like
a

of

falls
from
above
into
the
heap
of

the
beekeeper
opens
two
central
frames
so
as
to
see
into
the
nest
where
formerly
the
entire
space
was
covered
by
the
black
circles
of
thousands
of
bees
sitting
tightly
back
to
back
guarding
the
lofty
mysteries
of
generation
he
now
sees
hundreds
of
dejected
halfalive
and
somnolent
husks
of
bees
they
are
almost
all
dead
not
knowing
it
themselves
sitting
over
the
sacred
thing
they
were
guarding
which
is

the
beekeeper
closes
the
frames
marks
the
hive
with
chalk
and
when
he
finds
time
breaks
it
open
and
burns
it
out
so
moscow
was
empty
when
napoleon
weary
restless
and
scowling
paced
back
and
forth
by
the

what
to
his
mind
was
a
necessary
though
external
observance
of

deputation
in

corners
of
moscow

a
few
people
still
stirred
meaninglessly
keeping
to
old
habits
and
not
understanding
what
they
were
doing
when
with
due
caution
it
was
announced
to
napoleon
that
moscow
was
empty
he
glared
angrily
at

announced
it

turning
away
went
on

russian

along

the

the
biggest
crush
during

of

occurred
on

and

at
the
time
when
after
dividing
in
two
around
the
kremlin
the
troops
jammed
together
on
the
moskvoretsky
and
kamenny
bridges
a
great
number
of
soldiers
taking
advantage
of
the
pause
and
the
congestion
turned
back
from
the
bridges
and
darted
furtively
and
silently
past
basil
the
blessed
and
under
the
borovitsky
gate
back
up
the
hill
to
red
square
where
by
some
intuition
they
sensed
that
other
peoples
things
could
be
taken
without
trouble
the
same
crowd
of
people
as
at
cutrate
sales
filled
all
the
passes
and
passageways
of
the

there
were
no
caressingly

there
were
no

crowds
of

were
only
the
uniforms

greatcoats
of
soldiers
without

silently
coming
out

the
rows
laden
and
going
in
unladen
the

there
were
few
of

walked
among
the

like
lost
men
unlocking
and
locking
up
their

carrying
their
goods
off
somewhere
themselves
with
the

of
some
stalwart
young
men
on
the
square
by
the
shopping
arcade
drummers
stood
and
beat
to
muster
but
the
sound
of
the
drum
did
not
make
the
looting
soldiers
come
running
to
the
call
as
formerly
but
on
the
contrary
made
them
run
further
away
from
the
drum
among
the
soldiers
in
the
shops
and
passageways
people
in
gray
kaftans
and
with

could
be

two

one
with
a
sash
over
his

on
a
lean

gray
horse
the
other
in
a
greatcoat
on

standing
at

shouted
at

hoisting

slipped
past

into
the
rows
stop

off

went
into

arcade
with
him
a
group
of

broke
into

run
a
shopkeeper
with
red
pimples
on
his
cheeks
near
the
nose
with
a
calmly
unshakeable
expression
of
calculation
on
his
wellfed
face
went
up
to
the
officer
hastily
and
jauntily
swinging
his
arms

officer
stood
perplexed
and
hesitation
could
be
seen
in
his
face
ah
what
business
is
it
of
mine
he
cried
suddenly
and
walked
with
quick
steps
down
the
row
from
one
open
shop
came
the
sound
of
blows
and
abuse
and
just
as
the
officer
reached
it
a
man
in
a
gray
coat
and
with
a
shaved
head
was
sent
flying
out
of
the
door
this
man
bending
double
flashed
past
the
shopkeepers
and
the
officer
the
officer
fell
upon
the
soldiers
who
were
in
the
shop
but
just
then
the
terrible
cries
of
an
enormous
crowd
came
from
the
moskvoretsky
bridge
and
the
officer
ran
out
to
the
square
what
is
it
what
is
it
he
asked
but
his
comrade
was
already
galloping
in
the
direction
of
the
cries
past
basil
the
blessed
the
officer
got
on
his
horse
and
followed
him
when
he
rode
up
to
the
bridge
he
saw
two
cannon
dismounted
from
their
carriages
infantry
going
across
the
bridge
several
overturned
wagons
several
frightened
faces
and
the
laughing
faces
of
soldiers
near
the
cannon
stood
a
cart
hitched
to
two
horses
behind
the
cart
four
wolfhounds
in
collars
pressed
up
close
to
the
wheels
the
cart
was
heaped
with
chattels
and
on
the
very
top
next
to
a
childs
chair
turned
legs
up
sat
a
woman
shrieking
piercingly
and
desperately
his
comrades
told
the
officer
that
the
cries
of
the
crowd
and
the
shrieking
of
the
woman
came
from
the
fact
that
general
ermolov
had
come
upon
this
crowd
and
learning
that
the
soldiers
had
scattered
to
the
shops
and
crowds
of
inhabitants
were
blocking
the
bridge
had
ordered
the
cannon
dismounted
from
their
carriages
and
had
pretended
that
he
was
about
to
fire
on
the
bridge
the
crowd
overturning
carts
crushing
each
other
crying
desperately
shoving
had
cleared
the
bridge
and
the
troops
were
now
moving
forward
xxii
the
city
itself
meanwhile
was
empty
there
was
almost
no
one
in
the
streets
the
gates
and
shops
were
all
locked
here
and
there
around
the
pothouses
solitary
shouts
or
drunken
singing
could
be
heard
no
one
drove
through
the
streets
and
the
footsteps
of
pedestrians
were
rarely
heard
povarskaya
street
was
completely
quiet
and
deserted
in
the
huge
courtyard
of
the
rostovs
house
leftover
hay
and
dung
from
the
cart
horses
lay
about
and
not
a
single
person
was
to
be
seen
in
the
big
drawing
room
of
the
rostovs
house
where
all
their
belongings
had
been
left
behind
there
were
two
people
they
were
the
yard

ignat
and
the
servant

mishka
vassilyichs

who
had
stayed

and
played

joyfully

before
the
big

the

suddenly
beginning
to

on

replied
ignat
marveling
at
the
smile
spreading
across
his
face
in
the
mirror
shameless

the
voice
of
mavra
kuzminishna
who
had

and

wiping
the
dust
off
closed
the
clavichord
and
with
a
heavy
sigh
left
the
drawing
room
and
locked
the
door
going
out
to
the
courtyard
mavra
kuzminishna
pondered
where
to
go
next
to
have
tea
with
vassilyich
in
the
wing
or
to
the
pantry
to
put
away
what
had
not
been
put
away
yet
in
the
quiet
street
there
was
the
sound
of
quick
footsteps
the
footsteps
stopped
by
the
door
in
the
gate
the
latch
rattled
under
a
hand
that
tried
to
open
it
mavra
kuzminishna
went
up
to
the
gate
who

a
pleasant
and
gentlemanly
russian
voice
mavra
kuzminishna
opened
the
door
an
officer
of
about
eighteen
with
a
round
face
of
a
type
resembling
the
rostovs
came
into
the
courtyard
theyre

mavra
kuzminishna
said
kindly
the
young
officer
standing
in
the
doorway
as
if
undecided
whether
to
go
in
or
not
clucked
his
tongue
ah
how
vexing
he
said
yesterday
i

haveah
what
a
pity
mavra
kuzminishna
meanwhile
was
attentively
and
sympathetically
studying
the
familiar
features
of
the
rostov
breed
in
the
young
mans
face
and
the
worn
greatcoat
and
downatheel
boots
he
had
on
what
did
you
want
the
count
for
she
asked
ah
wellnothing
to
be
done
the
officer
said
vexedly
and
grasped
the
door
as
if
intending
to
leave
again
he
stopped
in
indecision
you
see
he
said
suddenly
im
a
relative
of
the
counts
and
hes
always
been
very
kind
to
me
well
so
you
see
he
looked
at
his
cloak
and
boots
with
a
kind
and
cheerful
smile
im
a
bit
shabby
and
ive
got
no
money
so

count
mavra
kuzminishna
did
not
let
him
finish
you

one
little
minute
dearie
just
one
little
minute
she
said
and
as
soon
as
the
officer
let
go
of
the
gate
mavra
kuzminishna
turned
and
with
a
quick
oldwomanish
step
went
to
her
wing
in
the
back
yard
while
mavra
kuzminishna
was
running
to
her
room
the
officer
lowering
his
head
and
gazing
at
his
torn
boots
strolled
about
the
courtyard
smiling
slightly
what
a
pity
i
didnt
find
my
uncle
but
shes
a
nice
old
woman
where
did
she
run
off
to
and
how

i
to
find
out
by
what
streets
it
will
be
closest
for
me
to
catch
up
with
my
regiment
which
must
now
be
approaching
the
rogozhsky
gate
the
young
officer
was
thinking
just
then
mavra
kuzminishna
with
a
frightened
and
at
the
same
time
determined
face
carrying
a
folded
checkered
handkerchief
in
her
hands
came
around
the
corner
while
still
a
few
steps
away
she
unfolded
the
handkerchief
took
a
white
twentyfive
rouble
note
from
it
and
hastily
handed
it
to
the
officer
if
his
excellency
had
been
at
home
goodness
knows
hed
just
have
given
it
to
you
since
youre
a
relationso
maybenow
mavra
kuzminishna
became
timid
and
confused
but
the
officer
not
refusing
and
not
hurrying
took
the
note
and
thanked
mavra
kuzminishna
if
the
count
had
been
at
home
mavra
kuzminishna
kept
saying
apologetically
christ
be
with
you
dearie
god
save
you
she
said
bowing
and
seeing
him
off
the
officer
smiling
and
shaking
his
head
as
if
laughing
at
himself
ran
almost
at
a
trot
down
the
empty
street
towards
the
yauzsky
bridge
to
catch
up
with
his
regiment
and
mavra
kuzminishna
went
on
standing
for
a
long
time
with
moist
eyes
before
the
closed
gate
pensively
shaking
her
head
and
feeling
a
sudden
flood
of
maternal
tenderness
and
pity
for
the
unknown
little
officer
xxiii
in
an
unfinished
house
on
varvarka
street
with
a
pothouse
on
the
ground
floor
drunken
shouting
and
singing
was
heard
some
ten
factory
workers
were
sitting
on
benches
by
the
tables
in
a
small
dirty
room
drunk
sweaty
blearyeyed
straining
and
opening
their
mouths
wide
they
were
all
singing
some
song
they
sang
discordantly
with
difficulty
with
effort
obviously
not
because
they
wanted
to
sing
but
only
in
order
to
prove
that
they
were
drunk
and
carousing
one
of
them
a
tall
blond
fellow
in
a
clean
blue
coat
was
standing
over
them
his
face
with
its
thin
straight
nose
would
have
been
handsome
if
it
were
not
for
the
thin
compressed
constantly
moving
lips
and
dull
fixed
frowning
eyes
he
stood
over
those
who
were
singing
and
evidently
imagining
something
to
himself
swung
his
white
arm
bared
to
the
elbow
solemnly
and
awkwardly
above
their
heads
trying
to
spread
the
dirty
fingers
of
his
hand
unnaturally
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
kept
coming
down
and
the
fellow
would
carefully
push
it
up
again
with
his
left
hand
as
if
there
was
something
especially
important
in
having
this
white
sinewy
waving
arm
be
unfailingly
bared
in
the
midst
of
the
song
shouts
of
fighting
and
blows
were
heard
in
the
front
hall
and
on
the
porch
the
tall
fellow
waved
his
arm
enough
he
cried
imperiously
theres
a
fight
boys
and
ceaselessly
pushing
up
his
sleeve
he
went
out
to
the
porch
the
factory
workers
followed
him
the
factory
workers
drinking
in
the
pothouse
that
morning
under
the
leadership
of
the
tall
fellow
had
brought
the
landlord
some
leather
from
the
factory
and
for
that
he
had
given
them
vodka
the
blacksmiths
from
the
neighboring
smithies
hearing
noises
of
carousing
in
the
pothouse
and
supposing
it
had
been
broken
into
wanted
to
force
their
way
in
a
fight
started
on
the
porch
the
landlord
was
fighting
with
a
blacksmith
in
the
doorway
and
just
as
the
factory
workers
came
out
the
blacksmith
tore
himself
away
from
the
landlord
and
fell
facedown
on
the
pavement
another
blacksmith
was
straining
in
the
doorway
heaving
the
whole
weight
of
his
chest
against
the
landlord
the
fellow
with
the
pushedup
sleeve
still
in
motion
hit
the
blacksmith
straining
in
the
doorway
in
the
face
and
shouted
wildly
hey
theyre
beating
our
boys
just
then
the
first
blacksmith
got
up
from
the
ground
and
scraping
at
the
blood
on
his
smashedin
face
cried
in
a
tearful
voice

mans

brothers
good

a
man
shrieked
a
woman
who
came
out
of
the
neighboring
gates
a
crowd
of
people
gathered
around
the
bloodsmeared
blacksmith
its
not

said
addressing
the
landlord
did

and
kill
the
man
brigand
the
tall
fellow
standing
on
the
porch
shifted
his
bleary
eyes
from
the
landlord
to
the
blacksmiths
and
back
as
if
considering
whom
he
should
fight
now
fiend
he
suddenly
cried
to
the
landlord
tie
him
up
boys

just
you
try
it
cried
the
landlord
waving
away
the
men
who
came
at
him
and
tearing
his
hat
off
he
flung
it
on
the
ground
as
if
this
act
had
some
mysterious
threatening
significance
the
workmen
who
surrounded
the
landlord
stopped
in
indecision

cried
the
landlord
picking
up
his
hat
lets
go
then
lets
go
the
landlord
and
the
tall
fellow
repeated
one
after
the
other
and
they
both
set
off
down
the
street
the
bloodsmeared
blacksmith
walked
beside
them
the
workmen
and
some
other
people
talking
and
shouting
followed
after
them
at
the
corner
of
maroseika
across
from
a
big
house
with
closed
shutters
on
which
a
cobblers
shingle

and
the
cobblers
with
hasty
curiosity

authorities

more
questions
and

the
landlord
taking
advantage
of
the
increased
crowd
fell
behind
and
went
back
to
his
pothouse
the
tall
fellow
not
noticing
the
disappearance
of
his
enemy
the
landlord
swinging
his
bared
arm
never
stopped
talking
attracting
general
attention
to
himself
people
pressed
mainly
around
him
supposing

would
receive
answers
from
him
to
the
questions
that
occupied
them

barely
perceptible
smile

no
authorities

thievery

by
the

another
small

in

and
the
people
streamed
towards
the
reader
the
man
in
the
frieze
overcoat
was
reading
a
poster
from
the
thirtyfirst
of
august
when
the
crowd
surrounded
him
he
seemed
embarrassed
but
at
the
demand
of
the
tall
fellow
who
pushed
his
way
through
to
him
he
began
with
a
slight
tremor
in
his
voice
to
read
the
poster
from
the
beginning
early
tomorrow

going
to

serenity
the

the
tall

repeated
solemnly
smiling
with
his
mouth
and
frowning
with
his
eyebrows
to
talk
things
over
with
him
to
act
and
to
help
the

the
last

read
by
the
reader
amidst
total
silence
the
tall
fellow
hung
his
head
sadly
it
was
obvious
that
no

understood
those
last
words
in

the
words

upset
both
the

and
the
listeners

tuned
to
a
higher
pitch
and
this
was
too
simple
needlessly
simple

was
something

could
have
said
and
that
a
ukase
issuing
from
the
highest
authority
therefore

moved
his
lips
and
swayed
slightly

suddenly
came
from

rows
of

turned
to
the

driving
out
to

accompanied
by

mounted
dragoons
the
police

errand
had
made
a
large
sum
of
money
which
at
that
moment
was
in
his
pocket

the
crowd
of
people
moving
towards
him
and
ordered
his
coachman
to
stop
who
are
these
people

cried
to
the
men
who
were
approaching
the
droshky
singly
and
timidly
who

police

repeated
without
getting
an
answer

said
to
the
coachman
the
crowd
stopped
clustering
around
those
who
had
heard
what
the
official
said
and
gazing
at
the
departing
droshky
the
police
chief
glanced
back
fearfully
at
that
moment
said
something
to
the
coachman
and
his
horses
picked
up

its
a
trick

in
the
direction
of
the

the
gentry
and
the
merchants
have
all
gone
and
were
to
perish
for
that
what
are
we
dogs
or
something
was
frequently
heard
in
the
crowd
xxiv
on
the
evening
of
the
first
of
september
after
his
meeting
with
kutuzov
count
rastopchin
upset
and
offended
that
he
had
not
been
invited
to
the
council
of
war
that
kutuzov
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
suggestion
of
taking
the
defense
of
the
capital
and
astonished
at
the
new
view
revealed
to
him
in
the
camp
in
which
the
question
of
the
tranquillity
of
the
capital
and
its
patriotic
spirit
appeared
not
only
secondary
but
completely
unnecessary
and
insignificantupset
offended
and
astonished
at
all
that
count
rastopchin
returned
to
moscow
after
supper
without
undressing
the
count
lay
down
on
the
couch
and
was
awakened
past
midnight
by
a
courier
who
brought
him
a
letter
from
kutuzov
the
letter
said
that
as
the
troops
were
retreating
to
the
ryazan
road
beyond
moscow
would
the
count
be
so
good
as
to
send
police
officers
to
lead
the
troops
through
the
city
this
came
as
no
news
to
rastopchin
not
only
since
the
previous
days
meeting
with
kutuzov
on
poklonnaya
hill
but
ever
since
the
battle
of
borodino
when
all
the
generals
who
came
to
moscow
said
with
one
voice
that
it
was
still
impossible
to
offer
battle
and
when
with
the
counts
permission
government
property
was
being
evacuated
every
night
and
half
the
inhabitants
had
left
count
rastopchin
had
known
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
nevertheless
this
news
conveyed
in
the
form
of
a
simple
note
with
an
order
from
kutuzov
and
received
during
the
night
just
as
he
was
falling
asleep
astonished
and
vexed
the
count
afterwards
explaining
his
activity
during
this
time
count
rastopchin
wrote
several
times
in
his
notes
that
he
then
had
two
important
goals
de
maintenir
la
tranquillit233

moscou
et
den
faire
partir
les
habitants
if
we
allow
for
this
double
goal
every
one
of
rastopchins
acts
turns
out
to
be
irreproachable
why
were
the
holy
objects
the
weapons
shot
powder
stores
of
grain
not
evacuated
why
were
thousands
of
inhabitants
deceived
about
moscow
not
being
surrendered
and
thereby
ruined
in
order
to
maintain
tranquillity
in
the
capital
replies
count
rastopchins
explanation
why
were
heaps
of
useless
papers
from
government
offices
evacuated
along
with
leppichs
balloon
and
other
objects
in
order
to
leave
the
city
empty
replies
count
rastopchins
explanation
one
need
only
allow
that
something
threatened
the
tranquillity
of
the
people
and
every
action
becomes
justified
all
the
horrors
of
the
reign
of
terror
were
based
only
on
concern
for
public
tranquillity
on
what
then
did
count
rastopchin
base
his
fear
for
public
tranquillity
in
moscow
in
the
year
1812
what
reason
was
there
to
suppose
there
was
a
tendency
to
revolt
in
the
city
the
inhabitants
were
leaving
the
retreating
troops
were
filling
moscow
why
should
the
result
of
that
be
a
popular
revolt
neither
in
moscow
nor
anywhere
in
russia
did
anything
resembling
an
insurrection
occur
at
the
entrance
of
the
enemy
on
the
first
of
september
on
the
second
of
september
there
were
more
than
ten
thousand
people
still
in
moscow
and
a
the
crowd
that
gathered
in
the
commander
in
chiefs
courtyard
and
was
drawn
there
by
the
man
himselfthere
was
nothing
obviously
there
would
have
been
still
less
reason
to
expect
a
disturbance
among
the
people
if
after
the
battle
of
borodino
when
the
surrender
of
moscow
became
obvious
or
at
least
probable
instead
of
stirring
people
up
by
distributing
weapons
and
posters
rastopchin
had
taken
measures
to
evacuate
all
the
holy
objects
powder
shot
and
money
and
had
announced
directly
to
the
people
that
the
city
would
be
abandoned
rastopchin
an
ardent
sanguine
man
who
had
always
gone
about
in
the
highest
administrative
circles
though
he
did
have
patriotic
feelings
did
not
have
the
least
notion
of
the
people
he
thought
to
govern
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
enemys
entry
into
smolensk
rastopchin
had
fashioned
in
his
imagination
a
role
for
himself
as
a
guide
of
popular
feelingsthe
heart
of
russia
it
seemed
to
him
as
it
does
to
every
administrator
that
he
was
not
only
managing
the
external
activities
of
the
people
of
moscow
but
was
also
guiding
their
mood
by
means
of
his
appeals
and
posters
written
in
that
boorish
language
which
the
people
despise
in
their
own
milieu
and
which
they
do
not
understand
when
they
hear
it
from
above
the
beautiful
role
of
guide
of
popular
feelings
was
so
much
to
rastopchins
liking
he
grew
so
accustomed
to
it
that
the
necessity
of
quitting
that
role
the
necessity
of
abandoning
moscow
without
any
heroic
effects
caught
him
unawares
and
he
suddenly
lost
the
ground
under
his
feet
on
which
he
had
been
standing
and
decidedly
did
not
know
what
he
was
to
do
he
knew
but
with
all
his
soul
did
not
believe
until
the
last
moment
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
and
did
nothing
in
view
of
that
the
inhabitants
were
leaving
against
his
will
if
the
government
offices
were
evacuated
it
was
done
only
on
the
demand
of
the
officials
with
whom
the
count
agreed
reluctantly
he
personally
was
concerned
only
with
the
role
he
had
created
for
himself
as
often
happens
with
people
gifted
with
an
ardent
imagination
he
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
moscow
would
be
abandoned
but
had
known
it
only
with
his
reason
while
with
all
his
soul
he
had
not
believed
it
and
he
was
not
transported
in
imagination
into
that
new
situation
all
his
activity
painstaking
and
energetic
how
far
it
was
useful
and
had
an
effect
on
the
people
is
another
question
was
aimed
only
at
arousing
in
the
inhabitants
the
feeling
he
himself
experiencedpatriotic
hatred
of
the
french
and
confidence
in
himself
but
when
the
event
assumed
its
real
historical
dimensions
when
a
merely
verbal
expression
of
hatred
of
the
french
proved
insufficient
when
it
was
impossible
to
express
that
hatred
even
in
battle
when
selfconfidence
proved
useless
with
regard
to
the
one
question
of
moscow
when
the
entire
population
as
one
man
abandoned
their
property
and
poured
out
of
moscow
showing
by
this
negative
act
all
the
force
of
their
national
feelingthen
the
role
chosen
by
rastopchin
suddenly
proved
meaningless
he
suddenly
felt
himself
alone
weak
and
ridiculous
with
no
ground
under
his
feet
when
having
been
awakened
from
sleep
he
received
the
cold
and
peremptory
note
from
kutuzov
rastopchin
felt
the
more
vexed
the
more
he
felt
himself
to
blame
all
that
he
had
precisely
been
charged
with
all
the
government
property
he
was
supposed
to
have
evacuated
was
still
in
moscow
to
evacuate
everything
was
impossible
who
is
to
blame
who
allowed
this
to
happen
he
thought
certainly
not
i
i
had
everything
ready
i
held
moscow
like
this
and
see
what
theyve
brought
things
to
scoundrels
traitors
he
thought
without
defining
very
well
who
these
scoundrels
and
traitors
were
but
feeling
it
necessary
to
hate
whoever
the
traitors
might
be
who
were
to
blame
for
the
false
and
ridiculous
position
he
was
in
all
that
night
count
rastopchin
gave
orders
for
which
people
came
to
him
from
all
ends
of
moscow
those
close
to
him
had
never
seen
him

and

night
announcements
kept
coming
to
the
count
to
all
these
questions
the
count
gave
brief
and
angry
replies
showing
that
his
instructions
were
no
longer
needed
that
everything
he
had
so
carefully
prepared
had
been
spoiled
by
someone
and
that
this
someone
would
bear
all
the
responsibility
for
everything
that
was
happening
now
well
tell
that
blockhead
he
replied
to
the
request
from

that

angrily
at
the

of

battalions

your
excellency
meshkov
vereshchagin
vereshchagin
he
hasnt
been

yet
cried
rastopchin
bring
him
to
me
xxv
by
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
when
troops
were
already
moving
through
moscow
no
one
came
anymore
to
ask
the
count
for
instructions
everyone
who
could
go
was
going
on
his
own
those
who
stayed
decided
on
their
own
what
they
should
do
the
count
ordered
horses
prepared
in
order
to
go
to
sokolniki
and
frowning
yellow
and
taciturn
sat
in
his
office
with
folded
arms
to
every
administrator
in
peaceful
unstormy
times
it
seems
that
the
entire
population
entrusted
to
him
moves
only
by
his
efforts
and
in
this
consciousness
of
his
necessity
every
administrator
finds
the
chief
reward
for
his
labors
and
efforts
it
is
understandable
that
as
long
as
the
historical
sea
is
calm
it
must
seem
to
the
ruleradministrator
in
his
frail
little
bark
resting
his
pole
against
the
ship
of
the
people
and
moving
along
with
it
that
his
efforts
are
moving
the
ship
but
once
a
storm
arises
the
sea
churns
up
and
the
ship
begins
to
move
by
itself
and
then
the
delusion
is
no
longer
possible
the
ship
follows
its
own
enormous
independent
course
the
pole
does
not
reach
the
moving
ship
and
the
ruler
suddenly
from
his
position
of
power
from
being
a
source
of
strength
becomes
an
insignificant
useless
and
feeble
human
being
rastopchin
felt
that
and
it
irritated
him
the
police
chief
whom
the
crowd
had
stopped
entered
the
counts
study
along
with
the
adjutant
who
came
to
announce
that
the
horses
were
ready
both
were
pale
and
the
police
chief
having
reported
that
his
mission
had
been
accomplished
told
the
count
that
a
huge
crowd
of
people
was
standing
in
the
courtyard
and
wished
to
see
him
rastopchin
without
a
word
of
reply
stood
up
and
with
quick
steps
headed
for
his
bright
luxurious
drawing
room
went
to
the
door
of
the
balcony
took
hold
of
the
handle
let
go
again
and
went
to
the
window
from
which
the
whole
crowd
was
better
seen
the
tall
fellow
was
standing
in
front
waving
his
arm
with
a
stern
look
and
saying
something
the
bloodsmeared
blacksmith
was
standing
next
to
him
with
a
gloomy
air
through
the
closed
windows
came
the
noise
of
voices
is
the
carriage
ready
asked
rastopchin
stepping
away
from
the
window
yes
your
excellency
said
the
adjutant
rastopchin
again
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
balcony
what
do
they
want
he
asked
the
police
chief
they
say
your
excellency
that
they
have
gathered
on
your
orders
to
go
against
the
french
they
shouted
something
about
treason
its
a
violent
crowd
your
excellency
i
barely
got
away
your
excellency
i
venture
to
suggest
kindly
leave
i
know
what
to
do
without
you
rastopchin
cried
angrily
he
stood
at
the
door
of
the
balcony
looking
at
the
crowd
see
what
theyve
done
to
russia
see
what
theyve
done
to
me
rastopchin
thought
feeling
an
irrepressible
wrath
rising
in
his
soul
against
someone
to
whom
he
could
ascribe
the
cause
of
all
that
was
happening
as
often
happens
with
hottempered
people
wrath
had
already
taken
hold
of
him
but
he
was
still
seeking
an
object
for
it
la
voil224
la

he
thought
looking
at
the
crowd
la
pl232be
quils
ont
soulev233e
par
leur
sottise
il
leur
faut
une
victime
occurred
to
him
as
he
looked
at
the
tall
fellow
swinging
his
arm
and
it
occurred
to
him
precisely
because
he
needed
that
victim
himself
that
object
for
his
wrath
is
the
carriage
ready
he
asked
once
more
yes
your
excellency
what
are
your
orders
concerning
vereshchagin
hes
waiting
by
the
porch
said
the
adjutant
ah
cried
rastopchin
as
if
struck
by
some
unexpected
recollection
and
quickly
opening
the
door
he
stepped
resolutely
onto
the
balcony
the
talk
suddenly
ceased
hats
and
caps
were
taken
off
and
all
eyes
were
raised
to
the
emerging
count
greetings
lads
the
count
said
quickly
and
loudly
thank
you
for
coming
ill
come
out
to
you
presently
but
first
of
all
we
must
deal
with
the
villain
we
must
punish
the
villain
who
has
brought
ruin
to
moscow
wait
for
me
and
the
count
went
inside
just
as
quickly
slamming
the
door
an
approving
murmur
of
satisfaction
ran
through
the
crowd
it
means
hell
deal
with
all
the
villains
and
you
say
frenchmenhell
undo
the
whole
distance
for
you
people
said
as
if
reproaching
each
other
for
lack
of
faith
a
few
minutes
later
an
officer
came
hastily
out
of
the
front
door
gave
some
order
and
the
dragoons
stood
to
attention
the
crowd
eagerly
moved
from
the
balcony
towards
the
porch
coming
out
to
the
porch
with
wrathfully
quick
steps
rastopchin
hastily
looked
around
as
if
seeking
someone
where
is
he
said
the
count
and
the
moment
he
said
it
he
saw
coming
around
the
corner
of
the
house
between
two
dragoons
a
young
man
with
a
long
thin
neck
half
of
his
head
shaved
and
covered
with
new
stubble
this
young
man
was
dressed
in
a
oncefoppish
but
now
shabby
coat
of
dark
blue
broadcloth
lined
with
fox
fur
and
dirty
canvas
convicts
trousers
tucked
into
unpolished
thin
downatheel
boots
irons
hung
heavily
on
his
thin
weak
legs
hampering
the
young
mans
irresolute
steps
ah
said
rastopchin
hastily
turning
his
gaze
from
the
young
man
in
the
fox
fur
coat
and
pointing
to
the
lowest
step
of
the
porch
put
him
there
the
young
man
clanking
his
irons
climbed
heavily
onto
the
step
indicated
pulled
with
his
finger
at
the
chafing
collar
of
his
coat
turned
his
long
neck
twice
and
with
a
sigh
folded
his
slender
nonworking
hands
over
his
stomach
in
a
submissive
gesture
for
a
few
seconds
while
the
young
man
was
settling
himself
on
the
step
the
silence
continued
only
in
the
back
rows
from
among
the
people
pressing
towards
that
one
point
came
grunts
groans
the
sounds
of
shoving
and
the
stamping
of
shifting
feet
rastopchin
waiting
for
the
man
to
stand
still
on
the
appointed
place
frowningly
rubbed
his
face
with
his
hand
lads
rastopchin
said
in
a
ringing
metallic
voice
this
man
vereshchaginis
the
very
scoundrel
who
has
brought
ruin
to
moscow
the
young
man
in
the
fox
fur
coat
stood
in
a
submissive
pose
stooping
slightly
his
hands
clasped
together
over
his
stomach
his
emaciated
young
face
with
a
hopeless
expression
disfigured
by
the
shaven
head
was
lowered
at
the
counts
first
words
he
slowly
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
him
from
below
as
if
wishing
to
say
something
to
him
or
at
least
to
meet
his
eyes
but
rastopchin
was
not
looking
at
him
on
the
young
mans
long
thin
neck
behind
his
ear
a
vein
swelled
like
a
cord
and
turned
blue
and
his
face
suddenly
reddened
all
eyes
were
directed
at
him
he
looked
at
the
crowd
and
as
if
encouraged
by
the
expression
he
read
on
peoples
faces
smiled
sadly
and
timidly
and
lowering
his
head
again
shifted
his
feet
on
the
step
he
has
betrayed
his
tsar
and
his
fatherland
he
has
gone
over
to
bonaparte
he
alone
of
all
russians
has
disgraced
the
russian
name
and
he
has
brought
ruin
on
moscow
rastopchin
was
saying
in
a
flat
shrill
voice
but
suddenly
he
gave
a
quick
glance
down
at
vereshchagin
who
went
on
standing
in
the
same
submissive
pose
it
was
as
if
this
glance
blew
him
up
raising
his
arm
he
almost
shouted
turning
to
the
people
deal
summarily
with
him
i
hand
him
over
to
you
the
people
were
silent
and
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
from
behind
to
hold
on
to
each
other
to
breathe
in
that
infected
atmosphere
having
no
strength
to
stir
and
to
wait
for
something
unknown
incomprehensible
and
dreadful
was
becoming
unbearable
the
people
standing
in
the
front
rows
seeing
and
hearing
all
that
was
going
on
before
them
with
frightened
wideopen
eyes
and
gaping
mouths
strained
all
their
forces
to
hold
back
the
pressure
of
those
behind
them
beat
himlet
the
traitor
perish
and
not
disgrace
the
russian
name
rastopchin
began
shouting
cut
him
down
i
order
it
hearing
not
the
words
but
the
wrathful
sound
of
rastopchins
voice
the
crowd
groaned
and
moved
closer
but
stopped
again
count
vereshchagins
voice
timid
and
at
the
same
time
theatrical
said
in
the
momentary
silence
that
again
ensued
count
there
is
one
god
over
us
said
vereshchagin
raising
his
head
and
again
the
fat
vein
on
his
thin
neck
swelled
with
blood
and
color
quickly
rose
to
his
face
and
left
it
again
he
did
not
finish
what
he
wanted
to
say
cut
him
down
i
order
it
rastopchin
shouted
out
suddenly
turning
as
pale
as
vereshchagin
sabers
out
the
officer
cried
to
the
dragoons
drawing
his
own
saber
another
still
stronger
wave
swept
over
the
people
and
reaching
the
front
rows
this
wave
pushed
those
in
front
and
carried
them
swaying
to
the
very
steps
of
the
porch
the
tall
fellow
with
a
stony
expression
on
his
face
and
his
arm
permanently
raised
stood
beside
vereshchagin
cut
him
down
the
officer
almost
whispered
to
the
dragoons
and
one
of
the
soldiers
his
face
disfigured
by
rage
suddenly
struck
vereshchagin
on
the
head
with
the
flat
of
his
broadsword
ah
vereshchagin
cried
out
briefly
and
surprisedly
looking
around
in
fright
as
though
he
could
not
understand
why
this
thing
had
been
done
to
him
the
same
groan
of
surprise
and
horror
passed
through
the
crowd
oh
lord
someone
exclaimed
ruefully
but
after
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
escaped
vereshchagin
he
uttered
a
pitiful
cry
of
pain
and
that
cry
was
the
end
of
him
the
barrier
of
human
feeling
strained
to
the
utmost
in
holding
back
the
crowd
instantly
broke
the
crime
had
begun
it
was
necessary
to
go
through
with
it
the
pitiful
moan
of
reproach
was
stifled
by
the
menacing
and
wrathful
roar
of
the
crowd
like
the
seventh
and
last
wave
that
breaks
up
ships
this
last
irrepressible
wave
surged
from
the
back
rows
raced
towards
the
front
ones
knocked
them
down
and
engulfed
everything
the
dragoon
who
had
struck
vereshchagin
was
about
to
repeat
his
blow
vereshchagin
with
a
cry
of
terror
shielding
himself
with
his
hands
rushed
towards
the
people
the
tall
fellow
whom
he
ran
into
seized
vereshchagins
thin
neck
with
his
hands
and
uttering
a
wild
cry
fell
with
him
under
the
feet
of
the
pushing
tearing
people
some
beat
and
tore
at
vereshchagin
others
at
the
tall
fellow
and
the
shouts
of
the
crushed
men
and
of
those
who
were
trying
to
save
the
tall
fellow
only
excited
the
fury
of
the
crowd
for
a
long
time
the
dragoons
were
unable
to
free
the
factory
worker
bloody
beaten
almost
to
death
and
for
a
long
time
despite
all
the
feverish
haste
with
which
the
crowd
tried
to
finish
the
thing
they
had
begun
the
people
who
beat
strangled
and
tore
at
vereshchagin
were
unable
to
kill
him
the
crowd
pressed
at
them
from
all
sides
with
them
in
the
middle
heaving
from
side
to
side
like
a
single
mass
and
not
giving
them
the
opportunity
either
to
finish
him
off
or
to
abandon
him

him
with
an
ax
or
somethingcrush

and
only
when
the
victim
ceased
to
struggle
and
his
cries
were
replaced
by
a
drawnout
rhythmic
wheezing
did
the
crowd
hurriedly
begin
moving
around
the
prone
bloodstained
body
everyone
went
up
glanced
at
what
had
been
done
and
with
horror
reproach
and
astonishment
pressed
back
again
oh
lord
the
people

like
beasts

heard
in

fear

the
same
people
now
said
looking
with
painfully
pitying
expressions
at
the
dead
body
with
its
blue
face
all
smeared
with
blood
and
dust
and
with
its
long
thin
slashed
neck
an
assiduous
police
officer
finding
the
presence
of
a
corpse
in
his
excellencys
courtyard
inappropriate
ordered
the
dragoons
to
take
the
body
outside
two
dragoons
took
hold
of
the
mangled
legs
and
dragged
the
body
away
the
bloody
dustsmeared
dead
shaven
head
lolling
on
its
long
neck
trailed
on
the
ground
the
people
shrank
from
the
corpse
as
vereshchagin
fell
and
the
crowd
with
a
wild
roar
closed
and
swayed
over
him
rastopchin
suddenly
turned
pale
and
instead
of
going
to
the
back
entrance
where
the
horses
were
waiting
for
him
lowered
his
head
and
not
knowing
where
or
why
himself
went
quickly
down
the
corridor
that
led
to
the
groundfloor
rooms
the
counts
face
was
pale
and
he
could
not
stop
the
feverish
trembling
of
his
lower
jaw
your
excellency
this
waywhere
are
you
goingthis
way
please
a
trembling
frightened
voice
said
behind
him
count
rastopchin
was
unable
to
make
any
reply
and
turning
obediently
went
where
he
was
told
a
caleche
was
standing
by
the
back
entrance
the
distant
noise
of
the
roaring
crowd
was
heard
there
too
count
rastopchin
hurriedly
got
into
the
caleche
and
ordered
that
he
be
taken
to
his
country
house
in
sokolniki
driving
out
to
myasnitskaya
and
no
longer
hearing
the
cries
of
the
crowd
the
count
began
to
have
regrets
he
now
recalled
with
displeasure
the
agitation
and
fear
he
had
shown
before
his
subordinates
la
populace
est
terrible
elle
est
hideuse
he
thought
in
french
ils
sont
comme
les
loups
quon
ne
peut
apaiser
quavec
de
la
chair
count
there
is
one
god
over
us
he
suddenly
remembered
vereshchagins
words
and
an
unpleasant
sensation
of
chill
ran
down
count
rastopchins
spine
but
the
sensation
was
momentary
and
count
rastopchin
smiled
scornfully
at
himself
javais
dautres
devoirs
he
thought
il
fallait
apaiser
le
peuple
bien
dautres
victimes
ont
peri
et
perissent
pour
le
bien
publique
and
he
began
to
think
about
those
general
responsibilities
he
had
in
relation
to
his
family
to
his
entrusted
to
him
capital
and
about
himselfnot
as
fyodor
vassilievich
rastopchin
he
supposed
that
fyodor
vassilievich
rastopchin
had
sacrificed
himself
for
the
bien
publique
but
as
commander
in
chief
representative
of
the
authorities
and
the
tsars
plenipotentiary
if
i
were
merely
fyodor
vassilievich
ma
ligne

aurait
233t233
tout
autrement
trac233e
but
i
had
to
preserve
the
life
and
dignity
of
the
commander
in
chief
rocking
slightly
on
the
soft
springs
of
his
caleche
and
no
longer
hearing
the
dreadful
sounds
of
the
crowd
rastopchin
calmed
down
physically
and
as
always
happens
simultaneously
with
physical
calm
his
mind
also
devised
causes
for
him
to
be
morally
calm
the
thought
that
calmed
rastopchin
was
not
new
as
long
as
the
world
has
existed
and
people
have
been
killing
each
other
no
one
man
has
ever
committed
a
crime
upon
his
own
kind
without
calming
himself
with
this
same
thought
this
thought
was
le
bien
publique
the
supposed
good
of
other
people
for
a
man
not
gripped
by
passion
that
good
is
never
known
but
the
man
who
commits
the
crime
always
knows
for
certain
what
that
good
consists
in
and
rastopchin
now
knew
it
in
his
reasoning
he
not
only
did
not
reproach
himself
for
his
action
but
even
found
cause
for
selfsatisfaction
in
having
been
able
to
make
use
so
successfully
of
this
224
propos
to
punish
the
criminal
and
at
the
same
time
calm
the
crowd
vereshchagin
was
tried
and
sentenced
to
death
thought
rastopchin
though
the
senate
had
only
sentenced
vereshchagin
to
hard
labor
he
was
a
traitor
and
a
turncoat
i
couldnt
let
him
go
unpunished
and
besides
je
faisais
dune
pierre
deux
coups
for
the
sake
of
calm
i
gave
the
people
a
victim
and
punished
a
villain
on
reaching
his
country
house
and
busying
himself
with
household
instructions
the
count
became
perfectly
calm
half
an
hour
later
the
count
was
driving
with
fast
horses
across
the
sokolniki
field
no
longer
recalling
what
had
happened
and
thinking
and
considering
only
what
was
going
to
happen
he
was
now
driving
to
the
yauzsky
bridge
where
he
had
been
told
kutuzov
was
count
rastopchin
was
preparing
in
his
imagination
those
wrathful
and
stinging
reproaches
he
would
make
to
kutuzov
for
his
deception
he
would
give
that
old
fox
of
a
courtier
to
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
all
the
misfortunes
that
would
proceed
from
the
abandoning
of
the
capital
from
the
ruin
of
russia
as
rastopchin
thought
would
lie
solely
on
his
old
senile
head
thinking
over
beforehand
what
he
was
going
to
tell
him
rastopchin
turned
wrathfully
in
the
caleche
and
glanced
angrily
to
both
sides
the
sokolniki
field
was
deserted
only
at
the
end
of
it
by
the
hospice
and
the
madhouse
could
bunches
of
men
in
white
clothes
be
seen
and
several
solitary
ones
dressed
the
same
way
walking
across
the
field
shouting
something
and
waving
their
arms
one
of
them
ran
to
intercept
count
rastopchins
caleche
and
count
rastopchin
himself
and
his
driver
and
the
dragoons
all
looked
with
a
vague
feeling
of
horror
and
curiosity
at
these
released
madmen
and
especially
at
the
one
who
was
running
towards
them
swaying
on
his
long
thin
legs
his
robe
flying
the
madman
was
running
headlong
his
eyes
fixed
on
rastopchin
shouting
something
to
him
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
making
signs
for
him
to
stop
the
madmans
somber
and
solemn
face
overgrown
with
uneven
tufts
of
beard
was
thin
and
yellow
his
jetblack
pupils
shifted
low
and
anxiously
in
their
saffronyellow
whites
wait

i
tell
you
he
called
out
piercingly
and
then
cried
something
else
breathlessly
with
imposing
intonations
and
gestures
he
drew
even
with
the
carriage
and
ran
alongside
it
thrice
they
killed
me
thrice
i
rose
from
the
dead
they
have
stoned
me
they
have

i
destroy
it
thrice
will
i
raise
it
up
he
cried
raising
his
voice
more
and
more
count
rastopchin
suddenly
grew
pale
just
as
he
had
grown
pale
when
the
crowd
fell
upon
vereshchagin
he
turned
away
drdrive
faster
he
cried
to
the
coachman
in
a
trembling
voice
the
carriage
raced
as
fast
as
the
horses
could
pull
it
but
for
a
long
time
count
rastopchin
heard
the
ever
more
distant
mad
desperate
shouting
and
before
his
eyes
saw
only
the
surprised
frightened
bloody
face
of
the
traitor
in
the
furlined
coat
fresh
as
that
memory
was
rastopchin
felt
that
it
was
now
deeply
bloodily
engraved
in
his
heart
he
felt
clearly
now
that
the
bloody
trace
of
that
memory
would
never
heal
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
longer
he
lived
the
more
cruelly
and
tormentingly
that
terrible
memory
would
live
in
his
heart
he
now
fancied
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
words
cut
him
down
or
youll
answer
to
me
with
your
heads
why
did
i
say
those
words
they
came
out
somehow
accidentallyi
might
not
have
said
them
he
thought
then
nothing
would
have
happened
he
saw
the
frightened
and
then
suddenly
cruel
face
of
the
dragoon
who
struck
him
and
the
look
of
silent
timid
reproach
cast
at
him
by
that
boy
in
the
foxlined
coatbut
i
didnt
do
it
for
myself
i
had
to
act
that
way
la

bien

he
thought
troops
were
still
crowding
around
the
yauzsky
bridge
it
was
hot
kutuzov
frowning
glum
was
sitting
on
a
bench
by
the
bridge
and
playing
in
the
sand
with
his
whip
when
a
caleche
noisily
galloped
up
to
him
a
man
in
a
generals
uniform
in
a
plumed
hat
his
shifting
eyes
either
wrathful
or
frightened
came
up
to
kutuzov
and
began
saying
something
to
him
in
french
it
was
count
rastopchin
he
said
to
kutuzov
that
he
had
come
there
because
moscow
and
the
capital
were
no
more
and
there
was
only
the
army
it
would
be
different
if
your
serenity
had
not
told
me
you
would
not
surrender
moscow
without
offering
another
battle
none
of
this
would
have
happened
he
said
kutuzov
was
looking
at
rastopchin
and
as
if
not
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
words
being
addressed
to
him
was
trying
hard
to
read
something
special
written
at
that
moment
on
the
face
of
the
man
who
was
speaking
to
him
rastopchin
embarrassed
fell
silent
kutuzov
shook
his
head
slightly
and
not
taking
his
searching
gaze
from
rastopchins
face
said
softly
no
i
wont
give
up
moscow
without
offering
battle
whether
kutuzov
was
thinking
of
something
completely
different
as
he
said
those
words
or
he
spoke
them
deliberately
aware
of
their
meaninglessness
count
rastopchin
said
nothing
and
hastily
walked
away
from
kutuzov
and
strange
thing
the
commander
in
chief
of
moscow
the
proud
count
rastopchin
took
a
whip
in
his
hand
went
to
the
bridge
and
began
shouting
and
dispersing
the
clustering
carts
xxvi
towards
four
oclock
in
the
afternoon
murats
troops
were
entering
moscow
at
their
head
rode
a
detachment
of
w252rttemberg
hussars
on
horseback
behind
them
with
a
large
suite
rode
the
king
of
naples
himself
around
the
middle
of
the
arbat
by
st
nicholas
the
revealed
murat
stopped
to
wait
for
news
from
the
advanced
detachment
about
the
state
of
things
in
the
citys
fortress
le
kremlin
a
small
bunch
of
people
from
among
the
inhabitants
who
had
remained
in
moscow
gathered
around
murat
they
all
looked
with
timid
perplexity
at
the
strange
longhaired
commander
adorned
with
feathers
and
gold
what
is
he
their
tsar
himself
or
something
not
bad
quiet
voices
were
heard
an
interpreter
rode
up
to
the
bunch
of
people
take
your
hat
offyour
hat
they
said
in
the
crowd
addressing
each
other
the
interpreter
turned
to
an
old
yard
porter
and
asked
if
it
was
far
to
the
kremlin
the
yard
porter
listening
in
perplexity
to
the
polish
accent
which
was
foreign
to
him
and
not
recognizing
the
sounds
of
the
interpreters
talk
as
russian
speech
did
not
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him
and
hid
behind
the
others
murat
approached
the
interpreter
and
told
him
to
ask
where
the
russian
troops
were
one
of
the
russians
understood
what
was
asked
and
several
voices
suddenly
began
to
answer
the
interpreter
a
french
officer
from
the
advanced
detachment
rode
up
to
murat
and
reported
that
the
gates
of
the
fortress
were
closed
and
there
was
probably
an
ambush
inside
very
well
said
murat
and
turning
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
his
suite
he
ordered
four
light
guns
moved
forward
to
fire
on
the
gates
the
artillery
trotted
out
from
behind
the
column
following
murat
and
went
along
the
arbat
going
down
to
the
end
of
vzdvizhenka
street
the
artillery
stopped
and
lined
up
on
the
square
several
french
officers
took
charge
of
the
guns
setting
them
up
and
looking
at
the
kremlin
through
field
glasses
inside
the
kremlin
the
bells
were
ringing
for
vespers
and
this
ringing
confused
the
french
they
supposed
it
was
a
call
to
arms
several
infantrymen
ran
to
the
kutafyevsky
gates
in
the
gateway
lay
beams
and
wooden
screens
two
musket
shots
rang
out
from
the
gateway
as
soon
as
an
officer
with
a
unit
began
running
towards
it
the
general
who
stood
by
the
guns
shouted
a
command
and
the
officer
and
soldiers
came
running
back
three
more
shots
were
heard
from
the
gateway
one
shot
grazed
a
french
soldiers
leg
and
the
strange
shouting
of
a
few
voices
came
from
behind
the
screens
on
the
faces
of
the
french
general
officers
and
soldiers
the
former
expression
of
cheerfulness
and
calm
was
replaced
all
at
once
as
if
on
command
by
the
stubborn
concentrated
expression
of
a
readiness
to
fight
and
suffer
for
all
of
them
from
marshal
to
the
last
soldier
this
place
was
not
vzdvizhenka
mokhovaya
kutafaya
and
the
troitsky
gates
but
the
new
terrain
of
a
new
and
probably
bloody
battle
and
they
all
prepared
for
that
battle
the
shouting
from
the
gateway
ceased
the
guns
were
moved
forward
the
artillerymen
blew
the
snuff
from
their
wicks
the
officer
commanded
feu
and
the
whistling
sounds
of
two
tin
canisters
rang
out
one
after
the
other
shot
rattled
against
the
stone
of
the
gateway
the
beams
the
screens
and
two
clouds
of
smoke
billowed
over
the
square
a
few
moments
after
the
rolling
of
the
shots
over
the
stone
kremlin
died
away
a
strange
noise
was
heard
over
the
heads
of
the
french
a
huge
flock
of
jackdaws
rose
above
the
walls
and
crowing
and
flapping
thousands
of
wings
circled
in
the
air
along
with
that
sound
came
a
solitary
human
shout
in
the
gateway
and
from
behind
the
smoke
appeared
the
figure
of
a
man
without
a
hat
wearing
a
kaftan
he
was
holding
a
musket
and
aiming
at
the
french
feu
repeated
the
artillery
officer
and
one
musket
shot
and
two
cannon
shots
rang
out
simultaneously
smoke
again
covered
the
gateway
nothing
stirred
anymore
behind
the
screens
and
the
french
soldiers
and
officers
walked
up
to
the
gates
in
the
gateway
lay
three
wounded
and
four
dead
men
two
men
in
kaftans
were
fleeing
along
the
foot
of
the
wall
towards
znamenka
street
enlevezmoi
231a
said
the
officer
pointing
to
the
beams
and
the
corpses
and
the
french
having
finished
off
the
wounded
threw
the
corpses
down
behind
the
fence
who
these
men
were
no
one
knew
enlevezmoi
231a
was
all
that
was
said
of
them
and
they
were
thrown
out
and
taken
away
later
so
that
they
would
not
stink
thiers
alone
devoted
a
few
eloquent
lines
to
their
memory

it
was
reported
to
murat
that
the
way
had
been
cleared
the
french
entered
the
gates
and
began
setting
up
camp
on
senate
square
soldiers
threw
chairs
out
of
the
windows
of
the
senate
onto
the
square
and
built
campfires
other
detachments
passed
through
the
kremlin
and
settled
along
maroseika
lubyanka
and
pokrovka
streets
still
others
settled
along
vzdvizhenka
znamenka
nikolskaya
and
tverskaya
the
french
finding
no
owners
settled
everywhere
not
as
in
quarters
in
a
town
but
as
in
a
camp
located
in
a
town
though
ragged
famished
exhausted
and
reduced
to
a
third
of
their
former
number
the
french
soldiers
still
entered
moscow
in
an
orderly
manner
this
was
an
exhausted
emaciated
but
still
warlike
and
menacing
army
but
it
was
an
army
only
until
the
moment
when
the
soldiers
of
that
army
dispersed
to
quarters
as
soon
as
the
men
of
the
regiments
began
to
disperse
among
the
empty
and
wealthy
houses
the
army
was
annihilated
forever
and
what
emerged
were
neither
inhabitants
nor
soldiers
but
something
between
the
two
known
as
looters
when
the
same
men
left
moscow
five
weeks
later
they
no
longer
constituted
an
army
they
were
a
mob
of
looters
each
of
whom
drove
or
carried
with
him
a
heap
of
things
that
seemed
valuable
or
useful
to
him
the
goal
of
each
of
these
men
as
they
were
leaving
moscow
did
not
consist
as
before
in
conquering
but
only
in
keeping
what
they
had
acquired
like
the
monkey
who
putting
its
hand
into
the
narrow
mouth
of
a
jug
and
seizing
a
handful
of
nuts
will
not
open
its
fist
so
as
not
to
lose
what
it
has
seized
and
thereby
perishes
so
the
french
in
leaving
moscow
were
obviously
bound
to
perish
as
a
result
of
dragging
their
loot
with
them
but
to
abandon
that
loot
was
as
impossible
for
them
as
it
is
for
the
monkey
to
let
go
of
its
handful
of
nuts
ten
minutes
after
any
french
regiment
entered
some
quarter
of
moscow
there
was
not
a
single
soldier
or
officer
left
in
the
windows
of
the
houses
people
in
greatcoats
and
leggings
could
be
seen
laughing
and
strolling
through
the
rooms
in
cellars
and
basements
the
same
sort
of
people
were
bustling
about
with
provisions
in
the
courtyards
the
same
sort
of
people
opened
or
broke
down
the
gates
of
sheds
and
stables
in
the
kitchens
they
made
fires
and
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
baked
kneaded
and
cooked
frightened
amused
and
fondled
the
women
and
children
and
there
were
many
of
these
people
everywhere
in
the
shops
and
houses
but
there
was
no
more
army
on
that
same
day
the
french
commanders
issued
order
after
order
forbidding
the
troops
to
disperse
through
the
city
strictly
forbidding
looting
and
violence
to
the
inhabitants
and
announcing
a
general
roll
call
for
that
very
evening
but
despite
all
such
measures
the
men
who
formerly
constituted
an
army
were
spreading
throughout
the
rich
empty
city
abounding
with
comforts
and
supplies
as
a
hungry
herd
goes
across
a
bare
field
in
a
group
but
at
once
irrepressibly
scatters
as
soon
as
it
comes
upon
rich
pasture
so
the
troops
scattered
as
irrepressibly
through
the
rich
city
there
were
no
inhabitants
in
moscow
and
the
soldiers
were
absorbed
by
it
like
water
by
sand
and
irrepressibly
spread
starwise
in
all
directions
from
the
kremlin
which
they
occupied
first
of
all
cavalrymen
entering
a
merchants
house
abandoned
with
all
its
goods
and
finding
stalls
there
not
only
for
their
own
horses
but
extra
ones
as
well
still
went
to
occupy
the
house
next
door
which
seemed
better
to
them
many
occupied
several
houses
writing
on
them
in
chalk
who
the
occupier
was
and
quarreled
and
even
fought
with
other
units
before
they
had
time
to
settle
the
soldiers
ran
outside
to
look
over
the
city
and
hearing
that
everything
had
been
abandoned
rushed
wherever
valuable
things
could
be
had
for
nothing
officers
went
to
stop
the
soldiers
and
were
involuntarily
drawn
into
the
same
acts
in
carriage
row
there
were
abandoned
shops
with
vehicles
and
generals
crowded
there
picking
out
caleches
and
carriages
for
themselves
the
remaining
inhabitants
invited
the
officers
to
stay
with
them
hoping
to
protect
themselves
from
being
looted
there
was
an
abundance
of
riches
and
no
end
of
them
in
sight
everywhere
around
the
area
occupied
by
the
french
there
were
other
areas
unknown
and
unoccupied
in
which
as
it
seemed
to
the
french
there
were
still
greater
riches
and
moscow
absorbed
them
into
itself
more
and
more
just
as
when
water
is
poured
onto
dry
ground
the
result
is
that
both
water
and
dry
ground
disappear
so
when
the
famished
army
entered
the
abundant
empty
city
the
result
was
that
the
army
was
annihilated
and
the
abundant
city
was
annihilated
there
was
mud
there
were
fires
and
looting
the
french
ascribed
the
burning
of
moscow
au
patriotisme
f233roce
de
rastopchine
the
russiansto
the
savagery
of
the
french
yet
in
reality
with
regard
to
the
burning
of
moscow
there
were
not
and
could
not
be
any
reasons
for
placing
the
responsibility
for
it
on
one
or
several
persons
moscow
burned
down
because
it
was
put
into
conditions
in
which
any
wooden
town
would
have
to
burn
down
regardless
of
whether
the
town
had
or
did
not
have
a
hundred
and
thirty
poorquality
fire
pumps
moscow
had
to
burn
down
because
its
inhabitants
left
it
and
as
inevitably
as
a
pile
of
wood
chips
has
to
catch
fire
if
sparks
pour
down
on
it
for
several
days
a
wooden
town
in
which
in
the
presence
of
the
inhabitants
who
own
the
houses
and
of
the
police
there
are
fires
almost
every
day
during
the
summer
cannot
help
burning
down
when
there
are
no
inhabitants
there
but
troops
smoking
pipes
making
campfires
on
senate
square
out
of
the
senates
chairs
and
cooking
meals
twice
a
day
billet
troops
in
the
villages
of
some
area
during
peacetime
and
the
number
of
fires
in
that
area
increases
at
once
how
much
greater
then
is
the
possibility
of
fires
in
an
empty
wooden
town
in
which
foreign
troops
are
billeted
le
patriotisme
f233roce
de
rastopchine
and
the
savagery
of
the
french
are
not
to
blame
for
anything
here
moscow
caught
fire
from
the
pipes
the
kitchens
the
carelessness
of
enemy
soldiers
who
were
living
in
houses
they
did
not
own
if
there
was
arson
which
is
very
doubtful
because
no
one
had
any
reason
for
it
and
in
any
case
it
was
troublesome
and
dangerous
that
arson
cannot
be
taken
as
the
cause
since
without
any
arson
it
would
have
been
the
same
flattering
as
it
was
for
the
french
to
blame
the
brutality
of
rastopchin
and
for
the
russians
to
blame
the
villain
bonaparte
or
later
to
place
the
heroic
torch
in
the
hands
of
their
own
people
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
that
there
could
be
no
such
immediate
causes
for
the
burning
because
moscow
had
to
burn
down
just
as
any
village
any
factory
any
house
has
to
burn
down
which
has
been
left
by
its
owners
and
in
which
strangers
are
allowed
to
take
over
and
start
cooking
kasha
for
themselves
moscow
was
burned
by
its
inhabitants
true
but
not
by
the
inhabitants
who
stayed
in
it
but
by
those
who
left
it
occupied
by
the
enemy
moscow
did
not
remain
intact
like
berlin
vienna
and
other
cities
only
because
its
inhabitants
did
not
bring
out
bread
and
salt
and
the
keys
to
the
city
for
the
french
but
left
it
xxvii
the
absorption
of
the
french
which
spread
starwise
over
moscow
reached
the
neighborhood
where
pierre
was
living
only
by
the
evening
of
the
second
of
september
after
the
past
two
days
spent
solitarily
and
unusually
pierre
was
in
a
state
close
to
madness
his
whole
being
was
possessed
by
one
importunate
thought
he
did
not
know
how
or
when
himself
but
this
thought
had
now
taken
such
possession
of
him
that
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
past
understood
nothing
of
the
present
and
everything
he
saw
and
heard
went
on
before
him
as
in
a
dream
pierre
had
left
his
house
only
so
as
to
be
rid
of
the
complicated
tangle
of
lifes
demands
which
had
taken
hold
of
him
and
which
he
in
the
state
he
was
in
then
had
been
unable
to
disentangle
he
had
gone
to
iosif
alexeevichs
house
under
the
pretext
of
sorting
the
books
and
papers
of
the
deceased
only
because
he
was
seeking
rest
from
lifes
anxieties
and
the
memory
of
iosif
alexeevich
was
connected
in
his
soul
with
the
world
of
eternal
calm
and
solemn
thoughts
the
complete
opposite
of
the
anxious
tangle
he
felt
himself
being
pulled
into
he
had
sought
a
quiet
refuge
and
indeed
had
found
one
in
iosif
alexeevichs
study
when
in
the
dead
silence
of
the
study
he
sat
down
resting
his
elbow
on
the
deceased
mans
dusty
writing
table
memories
of
the
last
days
began
to
appear
calmly
and
meaningfully
one
after
another
in
his
imagination
especially
of
the
battle
of
borodino
and
of
that
indefinable
feeling
of
his
own
insignificance
and
falseness
in
comparison
with
the
truth
simplicity
and
strength
of
that
category
of
people
imprinted
in
his
soul
under
the
name
of
they
when
gerasim
roused
him
from
his
reflections
the
thought
came
to
pierre
that
he
would
take
the
peoples
defense
of
moscow
which
he
knew
was
projected
and
with
that
purpose
he
had
at
once
asked
gerasim
to
obtain
a
kaftan
and
a
pistol
for
him
and
announced
to
him
his
intention
of
concealing
his
name
and
staying
in
iosif
alexeevichs
house
later
in
the
course
of
his
first
day
spent
in
solitude
and
idleness
pierre
tried
several
times
but
was
unable
to
fix
his
attention
on
masonic
manuscripts
a
thought
had
vaguely
presented
itself
to
him
several
times
the
same
thought
he
had
had
before
about
the
cabalistic
connection
between
his
name
and
the
name
of
bonaparte
but
this
thought
that
he
lrusse
besuhof
was
destined
to
set
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
still
came
to
him
only
as
one
of
those
fantasies
that
without
cause
or
trace
flit
through
ones
imagination
when
having
bought
a
kaftan
only
with
the
aim
of
participating
in
the
peoples
defense
of
moscow
pierre
had
met
the
rostovs
and
natasha
had
said
to
him
youre
staying
ah
thats
so
goodthe
thought
had
flashed
through
his
head
that
it
would
indeed
be
good
even
if
moscow
were
to
be
taken
for
him
to
stay
there
and
carry
out
what
had
been
predestined
the
next
day
with
the
one
thought
of
not
sparing
himself
and
not
lagging
behind
them
in
anything
he
went
out
of
the
three
hills
gate
with
the
people
but
when
he
returned
home
convinced
that
moscow
would
not
be
defended
he
suddenly
felt
that
what
formerly
had
been
only
a
possibility
had
now
turned
into
a
necessity
and
an
inevitability
he
had
to
remain
in
moscow
concealing
his
name
meet
napoleon
and
kill
him
so
as
either
to
perish
or
to
put
an
end
to
the
misfortunes
of
all
europe
which
proceeded
in
pierres
opinion
solely
from
napoleon
pierre
knew
all
the
details
of
a
german
students
attempt
on
the
life
of
bonaparte
in
vienna
in
1809
and
knew
that
this
student
had
been
shot
and
the
danger
to
which
he
would
subject
his
life
while
carrying
out
his
intention
excited
him
still
more
two
equally
strong
feelings
drew
pierre
irresistibly
to
his
intention
the
first
was
the
feeling
of
the
need
for
sacrifice
and
suffering
in
the
awareness
of
the
general
calamity
that
feeling
on
account
of
which
he
had
gone
to
mozhaisk
on
the
twentyfifth
and
ended
up
in
the
very
heat
of
battle
and
had
now
run
away
from
his
home
and
instead
of
the
habitual
luxury
and
comforts
of
life
slept
on
a
hard
couch
without
undressing
and
ate
the
same
food
as
gerasim
the
other
was
that
vague
exclusively
russian
feeling
of
disdain
for
everything
conventional
artificial
human
for
everything
that
most
people
consider
the
highest
good
in
the
world
pierre
had
experienced
that
strange
and
fascinating
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
the
slobodsky
palace
when
he
had
suddenly
felt
that
wealth
and
power
and
lifeall
that
people
arrange
and
preserve
with
such
careall
this
if
it
is
worth
anything
is
so
only
because
of
the
pleasure
with
which
one
can
abandon
it
all
it
was
that
feeling
on
account
of
which
a
volunteer
recruit
drinks
up
his
last
kopeck
a
man
on
a
drunken
binge
smashes
mirrors
and
windows
without
any
apparent
reason
and
knowing
that
it
will
cost
him
his
last
penny
that
feeling
on
account
of
which
a
man
does
in
the
banal
sense
insane
things
as
if
testing
his
personal
power
and
strength
claiming
the
presence
of
a
higher
judgment
over
life
which
stands
outside
human
conventions
from
that
very
day
when
pierre
had
experienced
this
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
the
slobodsky
palace
he
had
been
constantly
under
its
influence
but
only
now
had
found
full
satisfaction
for
it
besides
at
the
present
moment
pierre
was
supported
in
his
intention
and
deprived
of
the
possibility
of
renouncing
it
by
what
he
had
already
done
along
that
path
his
flight
from
home
and
his
kaftan
and
his
pistol
and
his
declaration
to
the
rostovs
that
he
would
stay
in
moscowall
this
would
not
only
lose
its
meaning
but
would
become
contemptible
and
ridiculous
to
which
pierre
was
sensitive
if
after
all
that
he
left
moscow
like
everybody
else
pierres
physical
state
as
always
happens
coincided
with
his
moral
state
the
unaccustomed
coarse
food
the
vodka
he
had
been
drinking
during
those
days
the
absence
of
wine
and
cigars
dirty
unchanged
linen
two
halfsleepless
nights
spent
on
a
short
sofa
without
beddingall
this
kept
pierre
in
a
state
of
irritation
close
to
insanity
it
was
already
past
one
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
french
were
already
entering
moscow
pierre
knew
it
but
instead
of
acting
he
thought
only
about
his
undertaking
going
through
all
its
minutest
future
details
in
his
reveries
pierre
did
not
picture
vividly
to
himself
either
the
process
of
striking
the
blow
itself
or
the
death
of
napoleon
but
with
extraordinary
clarity
and
sad
enjoyment
pictured
to
himself
his
own
destruction
and
his
heroic
courage
yes
one
for
all
i
must
do
it
or
perish
he
thought
yes
ill
go
upand
then
suddenlywill
it
be
a
pistol
or
a
dagger
pierre
wondered
however
it
makes
no
difference
it
is
not
i
but
the
hand
of
providence
that
punishes
you
ill
say
pierre
thought
of
the
words
he
would
utter
as
he
killed
napoleon
well
so
take
me
punish
me
pierre
went
on
saying
to
himself
with
a
sad
but
firm
expression
on
his
face
bowing
his
head
while
pierre
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
reasoning
thus
with
himself
the
door
of
the
study
opened
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
totally
transformed
figure
of
the
previously
always
timid
makar
alexeevich
his
dressing
gown
hung
open
his
face
was
red
and
hideous
he
was
obviously
drunk
seeing
pierre
he
was
embarrassed
at
first
but
noticing
embarrassment
on
pierres
face
too
he
at
once
took
heart
and
on
staggering
thin
legs
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
room
theyve
turned
coward
he
said
in
a
hoarse
trustful
voice
i
say
no
surrender
i
sayisnt
it
so
sir
he
reflected
and
suddenly
seeing
the
pistol
on
the
table
seized
it
with
unexpected
swiftness
and
ran
out
to
the
corridor
gerasim
and
the
yard
porter
who
followed
makar
alexeevich
stopped
him
in
the
front
hall
and
tried
to
take
the
pistol
from
him
pierre
came
out
to
the
corridor
and
with
pity
and
revulsion
looked
at
this
halfcrazy
old
man
makar
alexeich
wincing
with
the
effort
clutched
the
pistol
and
cried
out
in
a
hoarse
voice
clearly
imagining
something
solemn
to
himself
to
arms
board
em
no
you
wont
take
it
he
cried
enough
please
enough
be
so
kind
please
leave
off
well
if
you
please
master
gerasim
was
saying
cautiously
trying
to
steer
makar
alexeich
towards
the
door
by
the
elbows
who
are
you
bonaparte
cried
makar
alexeich
thats
not
nice
sir
please

inside
have
some
rest
that
little
pistol
if
you
please
away
contemptible
slave
dont
touch
me
see
this
cried
makar
alexeich
brandishing
the
pistol
board
em
grab
him
gerasim
whispered
to
the
yard
porter
makar
alexeich
was
seized
by
the
arms
and
dragged
towards
the
door
the
front
hall
was
filled
with
the
ugly
noise
of
the
scuffle
and
the
drunken
wheezing
sounds
of
a
breathless
voice
suddenly
a
new
piercing
womans
cry
came
from
the
porch
and
the
cook
rushed
into
the
front
hall
its
them
saints
aliveits
them
by
god
four
on
horseback
she
cried
gerasim
and
the
yard
porter
let
go
of
makar
alexeich
and
in
the
hushed
corridor
they
clearly
heard
the
knocking
of
several
hands
on
the
front
door
xxviii
pierre
having
decided
to
himself
that
before
carrying
out
his
intention
he
must
reveal
neither
his
rank
nor
his
knowledge
of
french
stood
in
the
halfopened
doors
to
the
corridor
intending
to
disappear
as
soon
as
the
french
came
in
but
the
french
came
in
and
pierre
still
did
not
leave
the
doors
an
invincible
curiosity
kept
him
there
there
were
two
of
them
one
was
an
officer
a
tall
gallant
and
handsome
man
the
other
was
obviously
a
soldier
or
an
orderly
a
lowslung
skinny
sunburned
man
with
sunken
cheeks
and
a
dull
expression
on
his
face
the
officer
leaning
on
a
stick
and
limping
slightly
came
in
first
having
gone
several
steps
the
officer
as
if
deciding
to
himself
that
the
quarters
were
good
stopped
turned
around
to
the
soldiers
who
were
standing
in
the
doorway
and
in
a
loud
commanding
voice
called
to
them
to
bring
the
horses
having
finished
with
that
the
officer
raising
his
elbow
high
in
a
dashing
gesture
smoothed
his
mustache
and
touched
his
hat
with
his
hand
bonjour
la
compagnie
he
said
gaily
smiling
and
looking
around
him
no
one
made
any
reply
vous
234tes
le
bourgeois
the
officer
addressed
gerasim
gerasim
gave
the
officer
a
fearfully
questioning
look
quartire

said
the
officer
looking
at
the
small
man
from
above
with
an
indulgent
and
goodnatured
smile
les
fran231ais
sont
de
bons
enfants
que
diable
voyons
ne
nous
f226chons

he
added
patting
the
frightened
and
silent
gerasim
on
the
shoulder
ah
231a
dites
donc
on
ne
parle
donc
pas
fran231ais
dans
cette
boutique
he
added
looking
around
and
meeting
pierres
eyes
pierre
moved
away
from
the
door
the
officer
turned
to
gerasim
again
he
requested
that
gerasim
show
him
the
rooms
of
the
house
master
no
herenot
understandmy
your
said
gerasim
trying
to
make
his
words
clearer
by
saying
them
incorrectly
the
french
officer
smiling
spread
his
hands
before
gerasims
nose
giving
him
to
feel
that
he
did
not
understand
him
either
and
limping
walked
to
the
door
where
pierre
was
standing
pierre
wanted
to
go
away
and
hide
from
him
but
just
then
he
saw
makar
alexeich
thrusting
himself
out
of
the
open
kitchen
door
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
with
a
madmans
cunning
makar
alexeich
looked
the
frenchman
over
raised
the
pistol
and
took
aim
board
em
shouted
the
drunk
man
feeling
for
the
trigger
the
french
officer
turned
at
the
shout
and
at
the
same
moment
pierre
threw
himself
on
the
drunk
man
just
as
pierre
seized
the
pistol
and
raised
it
up
makar
alexeich
finally
managed
to
put
his
finger
on
the
trigger
and
a
shot
rang
out
deafening
them
all
and
drowning
them
in
smoke
the
frenchman
paled
and
rushed
back
to
the
door
forgetting
his
intention
not
to
reveal
his
knowledge
of
french
pierre
tearing
the
pistol
away
and
dropping
it
ran
to
the
officer
and
began
speaking
to
him
in
french
vous
n234tes
pas
bless233
he
said
je
crois
que
non
replied
the
officer
feeling
himself
all
over
mais
je
lai
manqu233
belle
cette
foisci
he
added
pointing
to
the
broken
plaster
of
the
wall
quel
est
cet
homme
the
officer
asked
sternly
looking
at
pierre
ah
je
suis
vraiment
au
d233sespoir
de
ce
qui
vient
darriver
pierre
said
quickly
totally
forgetting
his
role
cest
un
fou
un
malheureux
qui
ne
savait
pas
ce
quil
faisait
the
officer
went
up
to
makar
alexeich
and
seized
him
by
the
collar
makar
alexeevich
slackening
his
lips
as
if
falling
asleep
swayed
leaning
against
the
wall
brigand
tu

said
the
frenchman
taking
his
hand
away
nous

nous
sommes

apr232s
la

mais
nous
ne
pardonnons
pas
aux

he
added
with
gloomy
solemnity
in
his
face
and
with
a
handsome
energetic
gesture
pierre
went
on
persuading
the
officer
in
french
not
to
punish
the
drunken
insane
man
the
frenchman
listened
silently
without
changing
his
gloomy
look
and
suddenly
turned
to
pierre
with
a
smile
for
a
few
seconds
he
looked
at
him
silently
his
handsome
face
assumed
a
tragically
tender
expression
and
he
held
out
his
hand
vous
mavez
sauv233
la
vie
vous
234tes
fran231ais
he
said
for
a
frenchman
that
conclusion
was
unquestionable
only
a
frenchman
could
do
a
great
deed
and
the
saving
of
his
life
the
life
of
m
ramballe
capitaine
du
13
l233ger
was
without
question
a
very
great
deed
but
however
unquestionable
this
conclusion
and
the
officers
conviction
based
on
it
were
pierre
found
it
necessary
to
disappoint
him
je
suis
russe
he
said
quickly
tut
tut
tut
224

said
the
frenchman
wagging
his
finger
before
his
nose
and
smiling
tout

me
conter
tout
231a
he
said
charm233
de
rencontrer
un
compatriote
eh
bien
quallons
nous
faire
de
cet
homme
he
added
already
addressing
pierre
as
his
own
brother
even
if
pierre
was
not
a
frenchman
having
received
this
highest
title
in
the
world
he
could
not
renounce
it
said
the
tone
of
the
french
officer
and
the
expression
of
his
face
to
the
last
question
pierre
explained
once
again
who
makar
alexeich
was
explained
that
just
before
their
arrival
this
drunken
insane
man
had
stolen
a
loaded
pistol
which
they
had
not
managed
to
take
away
from
him
and
asked
that
his
act
go
unpunished
the
frenchman
thrust
out
his
chest
and
made
a
royal
gesture
with
his
hand
vous

la

vous
234tes
fran231ais
vous
me
demandez
sa
gr226ce
je
vous
laccorde
quon

cet
homme
the
french
officer
said
quickly
and
energetically
taking
the
arm
of
pierre
whom
he
had
just
promoted
to
frenchman
for
saving
his
life
and
going
into
the
house
with
him
the
soldiers
in
the
courtyard
hearing
the
shot
came
into
the
front
hall
asking
what
had
happened
and
showing
a
readiness
to
punish
the
guilty
ones
but
the
officer
sternly
stopped
them
on
vous
demandera
quand
on
aura
besoin
de
vous
he
said
the
soldiers
left
the
orderly
who
meanwhile
had
had
time
to
visit
the
kitchen
came
up
to
the
officer
capitaine
ils
ont
de
la
soupe
et
du
gigot
de
mouton
dans
la
cuisine
he
said
fautil
vous
lapporter
oui
et
le
vin
said
the
captain
xxix
when
the
french
officer
went
into
the
house
with
pierre
pierre
considered
it
his
duty
to
assure
the
captain
again
that
he
was
not
french
and
wished
to
leave
but
the
french
officer
would
not
hear
of
it
he
was
so
courteous
amiable
goodnatured
and
truly
grateful
for
the
saving
of
his
life
that
pierre
did
not
have
the
heart
to
refuse
him
and
sat
down
with
him
in
the
reception
room
the
first
one
they
came
to
to
pierres
assertion
that
he
was
not
french
the
captain
obviously
not
understanding
how
anybody
could
refuse
such
a
flattering
title
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
if
he
insisted
so
much
on
passing
for
a
russian
so
be
it
but
in
spite
of
that
he
would
be
forever
bound
to
him
all
the
same
by
a
feeling
of
gratitude
for
saving
his
life
if
this
man
had
been
endowed
with
at
least
some
ability
to
understand
the
feelings
of
other
people
and
had
guessed
pierres
feelings
pierre
would
probably
have
left
him
but
this
mans
lively
imperviousness
to
everything
that
was
not
himself
won
pierre
over
fran231ais
ou

said
the
frenchman
examining
pierres
dirty
but
fine
shirt
and
the
signet
ring
on
his
finger

in
the
sounds
of
the
voice
in
the
expression
of
the
face
in
the
gestures
of
this
officer
there
was
so
much
good
nature
and
nobility
in
the
french
sense
that
pierre
responding
with
an
unconscious
smile
to
the
smile
of
the
frenchman
pressed
the
hand
held
out
to
him
capitaine

he
introduced
himself
with
a
selfsatisfied
irrepressible
smile
that
puckered
his
lips
under
his
mustache

replied
that
he
could
not
give
his
name
and
blushing
tried
to
invent
a
name
and
talk
about
the
reasons
why
he
could
not
give
it
but
the
frenchman
hastened
to
interrupt
him

said

when
the

the

the

vodka
and
wine
from
a
russian
cellar
brought
along
by
the
french
were
served
ramballe
invited
pierre
to
share
this
dinner
and
at
once
began
eating
himself
greedily
and
quickly
like
a
healthy
and
hungry
man
quickly
chewing
with
his
strong
teeth
constantly
smacking
his
lips
and
saying
excellent
exquis
his
face
was
flushed
and
covered
with
sweat
pierre
was
hungry
and
shared
the
dinner
with
pleasure
morel
the
orderly
brought
a
pan
of
warm
water
and
put
a
bottle
of
red
wine
in
it
he
brought
a
bottle
of
kvass
besides
which
he
had
taken
from
the
kitchen
to
try
this
drink
was
already
known
to
the
french
and
had
been
given
a
name
they
called
it
limonade
de
cochon
pigs
lemonade
and
morel
praised
this
limonade
de
cochon
which
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen
but
since
the
captain
had
wine
procured
as
he
was
passing
through
moscow
he
left
the
kvass
to
morel
and
took
up
the
bottle
of
bordeaux
he
wrapped
the
bottle
to
the
neck
in
a
napkin
and
poured
wine
for
himself
and
for
pierre
appeased
hunger
and
the
wine
made
the
captain
still
more
lively
and
he
talked
ceaselessly
during
dinner

he
said
smiling
after
a
moments
silence
tant

en

he
winked
with
a
smile
avec

monsieur
pierre
nestce

the
captain
was
so
na239vely
and
goodnaturedly
merry
and
wholesome
and
pleased
with
himself
that
pierre
glanced
merrily
at
him
and
nearly
winked
himself
the
word
galant
probably
prompted
the
captain
to
thoughts
about
the
state
of
moscow

finishing
his
phrase
the
captain
looked
at
pierre
he
had
the
habit
of
stopping
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
and
gazing
intently
with
laughing
tender
eyes

noticing
that

under
the

of

had
drunk
and
after

he
had
spent
alone
with

experienced
an

asked
pierre
faltering
and
with
a
criminal
look
the
frenchman
looked
at
pierres
criminal
face
and
smiled
slightly
non
il
fera
son
entr233e
demain
he
said
and
went
on
with
his
stories
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
several
voices
at
the
gate
and
the
arrival
of
morel
who
came
to
tell
the
captain
that
the
w252rttemberg
hussars
had
arrived
and
wanted
to
put
their
horses
in
the
same
courtyard
with
the
captains
horses
the
difficulty
came
primarily
from
the
fact
that
the
hussars
did
not
understand
what
was
said
to
them
the
captain
ordered
the
sergeant
major
brought
to
him
and
asked
him
in
a
stern
voice
what
regiment
he
belonged
to
who
their
commander
was
and
on
what
grounds
he
had
allowed
himself
to
occupy
quarters
which
were
already
occupied
to
the
first
two
questions
the
german
who
had
a
poor
understanding
of
french
named
his
regiment
and
his
commander
but
to
the
last
question
which
he
did
not
understand
he
answered
putting
broken
french
words
into
german
that
he
was
the
regimental
quartermaster
and
that
his
commander
had
ordered
him
to
occupy
all
the
houses
one
after
another
pierre
who
knew
german
translated
what
the
german
said
for
the
captain
and
gave
the
captains
reply
in
german
to
the
w252rttemberg
hussar
having
understood
what
was
said
to
him
the
german
gave
up
and
led
his
men
away
the
captain
went
out
to
the
porch
giving
instructions
in
a
loud
voice
when
he
came
back
to
the
room
pierre
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
before
his
head
lowered
in
his
hands
his
face
expressed
suffering
he
was
indeed
suffering
at
that
moment
when
the
captain
went
out
and
pierre
was
left
alone
he
suddenly
came
to
his
senses
and
realized
the
position
he
was
in
it
was
not
that
moscow
had
been
taken
and
not
that
these
happy
victors
were
playing
the
masters
in
it
and
patronizing
himpainful
as
it
felt
to
pierre
that
was
not
what
tormented
him
at
the
present
moment
he
was
tormented
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
weakness
the
several
glasses
of
wine
he
had
drunk
the
conversation
with
this
goodnatured
man
had
destroyed
the
concentratedly
grim
state
of
mind
in
which
pierre
had
lived
for
those
last
days
and
which
was
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
of
his
intention
the
pistol
and
the
dagger
and
the
peasant
coat
were
ready
napoleon
would
enter
tomorrow
pierre
still
considered
it
just
as
useful
and
worthy
to
kill
the
villain
but
he
felt
that
now
he
would
not
do
it
why
he
did
not
know
but
it
was
as
if
he
had
a
presentiment
that
he
would
not
carry
out
his
intention
he
struggled
against
the
consciousness
of
his
weakness
but
he
dimly
sensed
that
he
would
not
overcome
it
that
his
former
grim
way
of
thinking
about
revenge
murder
and
selfsacrifice
had
fallen
into
dust
at
the
first
contact
with
a
human
being
the
captain
limping
slightly
and
whistling
something
came
into
the
room
the
frenchmans
chatter
which
had
previously
amused
pierre
now
seemed
disgusting
to
him
the
tune
he
whistled
and
the
way
he
walked
and
the
gesture
of
twirling
his
mustache
all
now
seemed
offensive
to
pierre
ill
leave
now
i
wont
say
another
word
to
him
thought
pierre
he
thought
it
and
meanwhile
he
went
on
sitting
in
the
same
place
some
strange
feeling
of
weakness
chained
him
to
his
place
he
wanted
to
get
up
and
leave
but
could
not
the
captain
on
the
contrary
seemed
very
merry
he
paced
the
room
a
couple
of
times
his
eyes
gleamed
and
his
mustache
twitched
slightly
as
if
he
was
smiling
to
himself
at
some
amusing
fancy
charmant
he
said
suddenly
le

he
sat

the

he
looked
at

for
a

with
laughing

up

made

but
looked
affectionately
into
the
frenchmans

this

pleasing

striking

the
captain
looked
intently
at
pierre
as
he
had
looked
at
him
when
he
learned
what
shelter
was
in

and
his
face
suddenly
brightened
ah

he
cried
merrily
pouring
two
glasses
of
wine
pierre
took
the
filled
glass
and
drank
it
ramballe
drank
his
shook

and
leaned

on

he
went
on
in
the
sad
and
measured
voice
of
a
man
who
is
about
to
tell
a
long
story
que
notre

est
lun
de
plus
anciens
de
la
france
and
with
the
easy
and
na239ve
candor
of
a
frenchman
the
captain
told
pierre
the
history
of
his
ancestors
his
childhood
adolescence
and
maturity
all
his
genealogical
proprietary
and
familial
relations
ma

naturally
played

he
said
growing
animated
encore
un

pierre
drank
again
and
poured
a
third
glass
oh
les
femmes
les
femmes
and
the
captain
looking
at
pierre
with
unctuous
eyes
began
talking
about
love
and
about
his
amorous
adventures
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
which
was
easy
to
believe
looking
at
the
officers
selfsatisfied
handsome
face
and
the
rapturous
animation
with
which
he
talked
about
women
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
ramballes
love
stories
had
that
smutty
character
in
which
the
french
see
the
exceptional
charm
and
poetry
of
love
the
captain
told
his
stories
with
such
a
genuine
conviction
that
he
alone
had
experienced
and
known
all
the
charms
of
love
and
described
women
so
enticingly
that
pierre
listened
to
him
with
curiosity
it
was
obvious
that
the
amour
which
the
frenchman
liked
so
much
was
neither
that
low
and
simple
kind
of
love
that
pierre
had
once
felt
for
his
wife
nor
the
romantic
love
he
felt
for
natasha
and
fanned
so
much
himself
ramballe
equally
despised
both
these
kinds
of
loveone
was
lamour
de
charretiers
the
other
lamour
des
nigauds
the
amour
which
the
frenchman
venerated
consisted
mainly
in
unnatural
relations
with
women
and
in
the
combinations
of
abnormalities
that
endowed
the
feeling
with
its
main
charm
thus
the
captain
told
a
touching
story
of
his
love
for
an
enchanting
thirtyfiveyearold
marquise
and
at
the
same
time
for
a
charmingly
innocent
seventeenyearold
child
the
enchanting
marquises
daughter
the
contest
of
magnanimity
between
the
mother
and
daughter
which
ended
with
the
mother
sacrificing
herself
and
offering
her
daughter
in
marriage
to
her
own
lover
excited
the
captain
even
now
though
it
was
a
longpast
memory
then
he
recounted
an
episode
in
which
the
husband
played
the
role
of
the
lover
and
he
the
lover
the
role
of
the
husband
and
several
other
comic
episodes
from
his
souvenirs
dallemagne
where
asile
means
unterkunft
where
les
maris
mangent
de
la
choucroute
and
les
jeunes
filles
sont
trop
blondes
finally
the
latest
episode
in
poland
still
fresh
in
the
captains
memory
which
he
recounted
with
quick
gestures
and
a
flushed
face
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
had
saved
the
life
of
a
pole
in
general
episodes
of
saving
lives
occurred
constantly
in
the
captains
stories
and
the
pole
had
entrusted
his
enchanting
wife
to
him
parisienne
de
coeur
while
he
himself
entered
into
the
service
of
the
french
the
captain
was
happy
the
enchanting
polish
lady
wanted
to
run
off
with
him
but
moved
by
magnanimity
the
captain
had
returned
the
wife
to
her
husband
with
the
words
je
vous
ai
sauv233
la
vie
je
sauve
votre
honneur
having
repeated
these
words
the
captain
rubbed
his
eyes
and
shook
himself
as
if
to
drive
away
the
weakness
that
came
over
him
at
this
touching
memory
listening
to
the
captains
stories
as
often
happens
late
at
night
and
under
the
influence
of
wine
pierre
followed
everything
he
said
understood
everything
and
at
the
same
time
followed
a
line
of
personal
memories
that
for
some
reason
suddenly
arose
in
his
imagination
as
he
listened
to
these
stories
of
love
suddenly
unexpectedly
he
remembered
his
own
love
for
natasha
and
going
over
the
pictures
of
that
love
in
his
imagination
he
mentally
compared
them
with
ramballes
stories
following
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
duty
and
love
pierre
saw
before
him
all
the
minutest
details
of
his
last
meeting
with
the
object
of
his
love
by
the
sukhareva
tower
then
this
meeting
had
made
no
effect
on
him
he
had
not
recalled
it
even
once
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
meeting
had
had
something
very
significant
and
poetic
about
it
pyotr
kirilych
come
here
i
recognized
you
he
now
heard
the
words
she
had
said
saw
before
him
her
eyes
her
smile
her
traveling
bonnet
a
stray
lock
of
hairand
something
touching
something
deeply
moving
appeared
to
him
in
all
this
having
finished
his
story
about
the
enchanting
polish
woman
the
captain
turned
to
pierre
with
the
question
whether
he
had
ever
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
selfsacrifice
for
the
sake
of
love
and
envy
of
the
lawful
husband
challenged
by
this
question
pierre
raised
his
head
and
felt
it
necessary
to
voice
the
thoughts
that
occupied
him
he
began
to
explain
that
he
understood
love
for
a
woman
somewhat
differently
he
said
that
he
loved
and
had
loved
only
one
woman
in
all
his
life
and
that
that
woman
could
never
belong
to
him
tiens
said
the
captain
then
pierre
explained
that
he
had
loved
this
woman
from
a
very
early
age
but
had
not
dared
to
think
of
her
because
she
was
too
young
and
he
was
an
illegitimate
son
without
a
name
later
when
he
had
acquired
a
name
and
wealth
he
had
not
dared
to
think
of
her
because
he
loved
her
too
much
placed
her
too
high
above
the
whole
world
and
the
more
so
therefore
above
himself
reaching
this
point
in
his
story
pierre
turned
to
the
captain
with
the
question
whether
he
understood
it
the
captain
made
a
gesture
which
said
that
even
if
he
did
not
he
still
asked
him
to
go
on
lamour
platonique
les
nuages
he
murmured
the
wine
he
had
drunk
or
the
need
for
openness
or
the
thought
that
this
man
did
not
and
never
would
know
any
of
the
persons
active
in
his
story
or
all
of
it
together
loosened
pierres
tongue
and
with
a
maundering
mouth
his
unctuous
eyes
looking
somewhere
into
the
distance
he
told
his
whole
story
his
marriage
the
story
of
natashas
love
for
his
best
friend
and
her
betrayal
and
all
his
own
uncomplicated
relations
with
her
urged
on
by
ramballes
questions
he
even
told
him
what
he
had
concealed
at
firsthis
social
positionand
even
revealed
his
name
to
him
of
all
that
pierre
told
him
the
captain
was
most
struck
by
the
fact
that
pierre
was
very
rich
that
he
had
two
mansions
in
moscow
and
that
he
had
abandoned
everything
and
had
not
left
moscow
but
had
stayed
in
the
city
concealing
his
name
and
rank
late
at
night
they
went
outside
together
the
night
was
warm
and
bright
to
the
left
of
the
house
the
first
moscow
fire
started
on
the
petrovka
glowed
brightly
to
the
right
high
in
the
sky
was
a
young
crescent
moon
and
opposite
the
crescent
hung
that
bright
comet
which
in
pierres
soul
was
connected
with
his
love
by
the
gate
stood
gerasim
the
cook
and
two
frenchmen
their
laughter
and
talk
in
mutually
incomprehensible
languages
could
be
heard
they
were
looking
at
the
glow
that
was
visible
in
the
city
there
was
nothing
terrible
about
a
small
distant
fire
in
a
huge
city
looking
at
the
high
starry
sky
at
the
crescent
moon
at
the
comet
and
at
the
glow
pierre
experienced
a
joyful
tenderness
see
how
good
it
is
what
more
does
one
need
he
thought
and
suddenly
remembering
his
intention
his
head
whirled
he
felt
sick
and
had
to
lean
on
the
fence
so
as
not
to
fall
without
saying
goodbye
to
his
new
friend
pierre
left
the
gates
with
unsteady
steps
and
going
back
to
his
room
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
fell
asleep
at
once
xxx
the
glow
of
the
first
fire
that
started
on
the
second
of
september
was
watched
from
different
roads
and
with
different
feelings
by
the
inhabitants
fleeing
moscow
in
carriages
and
on
foot
and
by
the
retreating
soldiers
the
rostovs
train
stopped
that
night
in
mytishchi
thirteen
miles
from
moscow
on
the
first
of
september
they
had
set
out
so
late
the
road
had
been
so
encumbered
with
carts
and
troops
so
many
things
had
been
forgotten
for
which
people
had
to
be
sent
back
that
it
had
been
decided
to
spend
that
night
three
miles
from
moscow
the
next
morning
they
started
late
and
again
stopped
so
many
times
that
they
only
reached
great
mytishchi
at
ten
oclock
the
rostov
family
and
the
wounded
who
were
traveling
with
them
all
settled
in
the
yards
and
cottages
of
the
big
village
the
servants
the
rostovs
drivers
and
the
orderlies
of
the
wounded
after
taking
care
of
the
masters
had
supper
fed
the
horses
and
went
out
to
the
porch
in
a
cottage
next
door
lay
raevskys
wounded
adjutant
with
a
shattered
hand
and
the
terrible
pain
he
felt
made
him
moan
pitifully
ceaselessly
and
those
moans
had
a
terrible
sound
in
the
autumnal
darkness
of
the
night
this
adjutant
had
spent
the
first
night
in
the
same
courtyard
as
the
rostovs
the
countess
said
she
had
not
slept
a
wink
on
account
of
that
moaning
and
in
mytishchi
they
took
an
inferior
cottage
only
so
as
to
be
further
away
from
this
wounded
man
one
of
the
servants
noticed
in
the
dark
of
the
night
above
the
high
body
of
a
carriage
that
stood
by
the
porch
another
small
glow
of
a
fire
one
glow
had
been
visible
for
a
long
time
already
and
everyone
knew
it
was
little
mytishchi
set
on
fire
by
mamonovs
cossacks
but
that
brothers
is
a
different
fire
said
an
orderly
they
all
turned
their
attention
to
the
glow
didnt
they
say
mamonovs
cossacks
set
fire
to
it
them
no

not
mytishchi

further
away

like

in
moscow
two
of
the
men
stepped
off
the
porch
went
around
the
carriage
and
sat
on
the
footboard
its
more
to
the
left
come
on
mytishchis
over
there
and
thats
on
a
completely
different
side
several
people
joined
the
first

at
it
blazing
up
said
one
that
gentlemen
is
a
fire
in
moscow
either
in
sushchevskaya
or
in
rogozhskaya
nobody
replied
to
this
observation
and
for
some
time
all
these
people
silently
watched
the
flames
of
the
new
fire
blazing
up
in
the
distance
old
danilo
terentyich
the
counts
valet
as
he
was
called
went
up
to
the
crowd
and

asked
one
of
the
servants
danilo
terentyich
made
no
reply
and
again
everyone
was
silent
for
a
long
time
the
glow
spread
and
wavered
farther
and
farther
lord
have
mercyits
windy
and
dry
a
voice
spoke
again
look
how
its
got
going

came
the
voice
of
danilo
terentyich
who
had
been
silent
until
then
his
voice
was
calm
and
slow
thats
our
moscow
brothers
he
said
she
our
dear
mother
of
white
st
his
voice
broke
and
he
suddenly
gave
an
old
mans
sob
and
it
was
as
if
they
had
only
been
waiting
for
that
to
understand
the
meaning
which
this
glow
they
were
looking
at
had
for
them
sighs
were
heard
words
of
prayer
and
the
sobbing
of
the
counts
old
valet
xxxi
the
valet
coming
back
in
told
the
count
that
moscow
was
burning
the
count
put
on
his
dressing
gown
and
went
to
look
madame
schoss
and
sonya
who
had
not
undressed
yet
went
with
him
only
natasha
and
the
countess
stayed
in
the
room
petya
was
no
longer
with
the
family
he
had
gone
ahead
with
his
regiment
which
was
marching
towards
the
trinity
monastery
the
countess
began
to
cry
on
hearing
the
news
about
the
moscow
fire
natasha
pale
with
a
fixed
gaze
sitting
on
a
bench
under
the
icons
in
the
same
place
where
she
had
sat
when
they
arrived
paid
no
attention
to
her
fathers
words
she
kept
listening
to
the
ceaseless
moaning
of
the
adjutant
coming
from
three
houses
away
ah
how
terrible
said
the
chilled
and
frightened
sonya
coming
in
from
outside
i
think
the
whole
of
moscow
will
burn
down
its
such
a
terrible
glow
natasha
look
now
you
can
see
it
from
here
through
the
window
she
said
to
her
cousin
evidently
wishing
to
distract
her
with
something
but
natasha
looked
at
her
as
if
she
did
not
understand
what
was
being
asked
of
her
and
again
fixed
her
gaze
on
the
corner
of
the
stove
natasha
had
been
in
this
state
of
stupor
since
morning
when
sonya
to
the
countesss
astonishment
and
vexation
had
found
it
necessary
no
one
knew
why
to
tell
natasha
about
prince
andreis
wound
and
his
presence
with
them
in
the
train
the
countess
had
rarely
been
so
angry
with
sonya
sonya
had
wept
and
asked
forgiveness
and
now
as
if
trying
to
smooth
over
her
guilt
constantly
attended
to
her
cousin
look
natasha
how
terribly
its
burning
said
sonya
whats
burning
asked
natasha
ah
yes
moscow
and
so
as
not
to
hurt
sonya
by
refusing
and
also
to
get
rid
of
her
she
moved
her
head
towards
the
window
looked
in
such
a
way
that
she
obviously
could
not
see
anything
and
again
sat
in
her
former
position
but
you
didnt
see
no
really
i
did
she
said
in
a
voice
pleading
to
be
left
in
peace
the
countess
and
sonya
both
understood
that
neither
moscow
nor
the
moscow
fire
nor
anything
else
of
course
could
have
any
meaning
for
natasha
the
count
went
behind
the
partition
again
and
lay
down
the
countess
went
up
to
natasha
touched
her
head
with
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
did
when
her
daughter
was
sick
then
touched
her
forehead
with
her
lips
as
if
to
see
whether
she
had
a
fever
and
kissed
her
youre
chilled
youre
trembling
all
over
you
should
lie
down
she
said
lie
down
all
right
ill
lie
down
ill
lie
down
in
a
minute
said
natasha
when
natasha
had
been
told
that
morning
that
prince
andrei
had
been
badly
wounded
and
was
traveling
with
them
only
at
first
had
she
asked
many
questions
about
where
how
was
the
wound
dangerous
and
could
she
see
him
but
after
she
was
told
that
she
could
not
see
him
that
he
was
badly
wounded
but
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger
she
stopped
asking
and
talking
obviously
not
believing
what
she
was
told
but
convinced
that
no
matter
how
much
she
talked
she
would
be
told
the
same
thing
all
along
the
way
with
her
wide
eyes
which
the
countess
knew
so
well
and
the
expression
of
which
she
feared
so
much
natasha
had
sat
motionless
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
was
now
sitting
in
the
same
way
on
the
bench
she
had
sat
down
on
she
was
planning
something
deciding
something
or
had
now
already
decided
it
in
her
mindthe
countess
knew
that
but
what
it
was
she
did
not
know
and
that
frightened
and
tormented
her
natasha
darling
undress
and
get
into
my
bed
the
countess
alone
had
a
real
bed
made
up
for
her
mme
schoss
and
the
two
girls
had
to
sleep
on
straw
on
the
floor
no
mama
ill
lie
down
here
on
the
floor
natasha
said
crossly
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
through
the
open
window
the
moaning
of
the
adjutant
could
be
heard
more
clearly
she
thrust
her
head
out
into
the
damp
night
air
and
the
countess
saw
her
slender
shoulders
shake
and
beat
against
the
windowsill
natasha
knew
it
was
not
prince
andrei
moaning
she
knew
that
prince
andrei
was
lying
in
the
same
cottage
where
they
were
in
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
front
hall
but
this
terrible
ceaseless
moaning
made
her
burst
into
sobs
the
countess
exchanged
glances
with
sonya
lie
down
darling
lie
down
my
dear
said
the
countess
touching
natashas
shoulder
lightly
with
her
hand
do
lie
down
ah
yesill
lie
down
right
now
said
natasha
hastily
undressing
and
tearing
the
lacings
of
her
petticoat
having
thrown
off
her
dress
and
put
on
her
night
jacket
she
sat
on
the
bed
that
had
been
prepared
for
her
on
the
floor
tucking
her
legs
under
and
throwing
her
thin
and
not
very
long
braid
over
her
shoulder
began
rebraiding
it
her
long
thin
accustomed
fingers
quickly
deftly
undid
plaited
and
tied
up
the
braid
natashas
head
with
a
habitual
gesture
turned
one
way
then
the
other
but
her
eyes
feverishly
wide
looked
straight
ahead
fixedly
when
the
preparations
for
the
night
were
over
natasha
slowly
lowered
herself
onto
the
sheet
that
covered
the
straw
on
the
side
nearest
the
door
natasha
lie
in
the
middle
said
sonya
no
ill
lie
here
said
natasha
do
go
to
bed
all
of
you
she
added
with
vexation
and
she
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
the
countess
mme
schoss
and
sonya
hastily
undressed
and
went
to
bed
only
the
icon
lamp
remained
lit
in
the
room
but
outdoors
the
fire
in
little
mytishchi
made
it
bright
for
two
miles
around
and
there
was
the
noise
of
drunk
men
shouting
in
the
pothouse
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
street
which
mamonovs
cossacks
had
broken
into
and
the
adjutants
constant
moaning
could
still
be
heard
natasha
listened
for
a
long
time
to
the
sounds
that
reached
her
from
outside
and
inside
and
did
not
stir
first
she
heard
her
mother
praying
and
sighing
the
creaking
of
the
bed
under
her
the
familiar
whistling
snore
of
mme
schoss
the
quiet
breathing
of
sonya
then
the
countess
called
natashas
name
natasha
did
not
answer
she
seems
to
be
asleep
mama
sonya
replied
softly
the
countess
after
a
brief
pause
called
once
more
but
now
no
one
answered
her
soon
after
that
natasha
heard
her
mothers
regular
breathing
natasha
did
not
stir
though
her
bare
little
foot
sticking
out
from
under
the
covers
felt
cold
on
the
bare
floor
as
if
celebrating
a
victory
over
everyone
a
cricket
chirped
in
a
crack
a
cock
crowed
far
away
others
responded
nearby
the
shouts
died
down
in
the
pothouse
and
only
the
adjutants
moaning
could
be
heard
natasha
sat
up
sonya
are
you
asleep
mama
she
whispered
no
one
answered
natasha
got
up
slowly
and
carefully
crossed
herself
and
stepped
carefully
with
her
slender
and
supple
foot
on
the
dirty
cold
floor
a
board
creaked
moving
her
feet
quickly
she
ran
several
steps
like
a
kitten
and
grasped
the
cold
door
handle
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
heavy
throbbing
rhythmically
was
beating
on
all
the
walls
of
the
cottage
it
was
the
pounding
of
her
own
heart
sinking
with
fear
breaking
with
terror
and
love
she
opened
the
door
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
onto
the
damp
cold
earthen
floor
of
the
front
hall
the
cold
enveloped
and
refreshed
her
with
her
bare
foot
she
felt
a
sleeping
man
stepped
over
him
and
opened
the
door
to
the
room
where
prince
andrei
was
the
room
was
dark
in
the
back
corner
by
the
bed
on
which
something
lay
a
tallow
candle
with
a
big
mushroom
of
snuff
stood
on
a
bench
already
that
morning
when
she
had
been
told
about
the
wound
and
prince
andreis
presence
natasha
had
decided
that
she
must
see
him
she
did
not
know
why
it
had
to
be
so
but
she
knew
that
the
meeting
would
be
painful
and
was
all
the
more
convinced
that
it
was
necessary
all
day
she
had
lived
only
in
the
hope
of
seeing
him
that
night
but
now
that
the
moment
had
come
she
was
terrified
of
what
she
was
going
to
see
how
disfigured
was
he
what
was
left
of
him
was
he
the
same
as
that
ceaseless
moaning
of
the
adjutant
yes
that
was
how
he
was
in
her
imagination
he
was
the
embodiment
of
that
terrible
moaning
when
she
saw
an
obscure
mass
in
the
corner
and
took
his
knees
raised
under
the
blanket
for
his
shoulders
she
imagined
some
terrible
body
and
stopped
in
horror
but
an
invincible
power
drew
her
on
she
carefully
took
one
step
another
and
came
into
the
middle
of
the
small
cluttered
room
another
man
was
lying
in
this
room
on
the
bench
under
the
icons
this
was
timokhin
and
two
more
men
were
lying
on
the
floor
these
were
the
doctor
and
the
valet
the
valet
rose
a
little
and
whispered
something
timokhin
suffering
from
the
pain
in
his
wounded
leg
was
not
asleep
and
stared
all
eyes
at
the
strange
apparition
of
a
girl
in
a
white
nightgown
a
jacket
and
a
nightcap
the
valets
sleepy
and
frightened
wordswhat
is
it
whyonly
made
natasha
approach
more
quickly
what
lay
in
the
corner
however
frightening
and
unlike
anything
human
this
body
was
she
had
to
see
it
she
went
past
the
valet
the
mushroom
of
snuff
fell
from
the
candle
and
she
clearly
saw
prince
andrei
lying
with
his
arms
on
the
covers
the
same
as
she
had
always
seen
him
he
was
the
same
as
always
but
the
inflamed
color
of
his
face
his
glittering
eyes
rapturously
fixed
on
her
and
especially
his
tender
childlike
neck
rising
from
the
turneddown
collar
of
his
shirt
gave
him
a
special
innocent
boyish
look
which
she
had
never
seen
in
prince
andrei
before
she
went
up
to
him
and
with
a
quick
supple
youthful
movement
dropped
to
her
knees
he
smiled
and
gave
her
his
hand
xxxii
for
prince
andrei
seven
days
had
gone
by
since
the
time
he
had
come
to
himself
in
the
dressing
station
on
the
field
of
borodino
for
all
that
time
he
had
been
almost
continuously
unconscious
in
the
opinion
of
the
doctor
who
accompanied
the
wounded
man
his
feverish
state
and
the
inflammation
of
his
injured
intestines
were
bound
to
carry
him
off
but
on
the
seventh
day
he
ate
with
pleasure
a
piece
of
bread
with
tea
and
the
doctor
observed
that
his
overall
fever
had
gone
down
prince
andrei
regained
consciousness
in
the
morning
the
first
night
after
they
left
moscow
had
been
quite
warm
and
prince
andrei
had
been
left
to
spend
the
night
in
the
caleche
but
in
mytishchi
the
wounded
man
himself
had
asked
to
be
taken
out
and
given
tea
the
pain
caused
by
the
transfer
to
the
cottage
had
made
prince
andrei
moan
loudly
and
lose
consciousness
again
when
he
had
been
placed
on
the
camp
bed
he
lay
for
a
long
time
with
his
eyes
closed
not
moving
then
he
opened
them
and
whispered
softly
what
about
the
tea
this
memory
of
the
small
details
of
life
struck
the
doctor
he
took
his
pulse
and
to
his
astonishment
and
displeasure
noticed
that
the
pulse
had
improved
the
doctor
was
displeased
to
notice
it
because
he
was
convinced
from
experience
that
prince
andrei
could
not
live
and
that
if
he
did
not
die
now
he
would
die
with
greater
suffering
sometime
later
timokhin
the
major
of
his
regiment
with
the
little
red
nose
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
leg
at
the
same
battle
of
borodino
and
had
joined
them
in
moscow
was
being
transported
along
with
prince
andrei
they
were
accompanied
by
the
doctor
the
princes
valet
his
driver
and
two
orderlies
prince
andrei
was
given
tea
he
drank
it
greedily
looking
with
feverish
eyes
at
the
door
straight
ahead
of
him
as
if
trying
to
understand
and
recall
something
i
dont
want
any
more
is
timokhin
here
he
asked
timokhin
crawled
towards
him
along
the
bench
im
here
your
excellency
hows
the
wound
mine
sir
its
all
right
what
about
you
prince
andrei
lapsed
into
thought
again
as
if
trying
to
recall
something
is
it
possible
to
get
hold
of
a
book
he
said
what
book
the
gospel
i
dont
have
it
the
doctor
promised
to
get
hold
of
it
and
began
to
ask
the
prince
about
what
he
felt
prince
andrei
answered
all
the
doctors
questions
reluctantly
but
reasonably
and
then
said
he
would
like
to
be
propped
on
a
bolster
because
he
was
uncomfortable
and
in
great
pain
the
doctor
and
the
valet
lifted
the
greatcoat
that
covered
him
and
wincing
from
the
strong
smell
of
rotting
flesh
that
spread
from
the
wound
began
to
examine
this
dreadful
place
the
doctor
remained
very
displeased
with
something
changed
something
turning
the
wounded
man
over
so
that
he
moaned
again
and
while
he
was
being
turned
again
fainted
from
the
pain
and
began
to
rave
he
kept
saying
that
they
should
quickly
get
hold
of
that
book
for
him
and
put
it
there
under
him
what
will
it
cost
you
he
said
i
dont
have
itget
it
please
put
it
under
me
for
a
moment
he
said
in
a
pitiful
voice
the
doctor
went
to
the
front
hall
to
wash
his
hands
ah
shame
on
you
really
the
doctor
said
to
the
valet
who
was
pouring
water
over
his
hands
i
just
looked
away
for
a
moment
you
laid
him
right
on
his
wound
its
such
pain
im
amazed
he
can
bear
it
i
thought
we
put
something
under
him
lord
jesus
christ
said
the
valet
for
the
first
time
prince
andrei
understood
where
he
was
and
what
had
happened
to
him
and
remembered
that
he
had
been
wounded
and
how
the
moment
the
caleche
stopped
in
mytishchi
he
had
asked
to
be
taken
into
the
cottage
confused
again
by
the
pain
he
had
come
to
his
senses
in
the
cottage
while
drinking
tea
and
here
again
repeating
in
his
memory
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
he
pictured
most
vividly
to
himself
that
moment
in
the
dressing
station
when
at
the
sight
of
the
suffering
of
a
man
he
had
no
love
for
those
new
thoughts
promising
happiness
had
come
to
him
and
those
thoughts
though
vaguely
and
indefinitely
now
took
possession
of
his
soul
again
he
remembered
that
he
now
had
a
new
happiness
and
that
that
happiness
had
something
to
do
with
the
gospel
that
was
why
he
had
asked
for
the
gospel
but
the
position
they
had
put
him
in
which
was
bad
for
his
wound
and
the
new
turning
over
had
confused
his
thoughts
again
and
he
came
back
to
life
for
the
third
time
in
the
total
silence
of
the
night
everyone
around
him
was
asleep
a
cricket
chirped
in
the
room
across
the
hall
someone
shouted
and
sang
outside
the
cockroaches
rustled
on
the
table
and
the
icons
and
a
fat
autumnal
fly
beat
against
his
headboard
and
around
the
candle
with
its
big
mushroomlike
snuff
that
stood
next
to
him
his
soul
was
not
in
a
normal
state
a
healthy
man
usually
thinks
feels
and
remembers
a
countless
number
of
subjects
simultaneously
but
has
the
power
and
strength
to
select
one
sequence
of
thoughts
or
phenomena
and
fix
all
his
attention
on
it
a
healthy
man
in
a
moment
of
the
deepest
reflection
can
tear
himself
away
to
say
a
few
polite
words
to
someone
coming
in
and
then
return
to
his
thoughts
but
prince
andreis
soul
was
not
in
a
normal
state
in
this
respect
the
forces
of
his
soul
were
all
clearer
and
more
active
than
ever
but
they
acted
outside
his
will
the
most
diverse
thoughts
and
notions
took
hold
of
him
simultaneously
sometimes
his
thought
suddenly
began
to
work
and
with
such
strength
clarity
and
depth
as
it
had
never
been
able
to
do
in
healthy
conditions
but
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
its
work
it
broke
off
and
was
replaced
by
some
unexpected
notion
and
he
was
unable
to
return
to
it
yes
a
new
happiness
was
revealed
to
me
inalienable
from
man
he
thought
lying
in
the
quiet
semidark
cottage
and
looking
straight
ahead
with
a
feverishly
wide
fixed
gaze
a
happiness
that
is
beyond
material
forces
beyond
external
material
influences
on
man
a
happiness
of
the
soul
alone
the
happiness
of
love
every
person
can
understand
it
but
only
god
could
conceive
and
prescribe
it
but
how
did
god
prescribe
this
law
why
the
son
and
suddenly
this
course
of
thoughts
broke
off
and
prince
andrei
heard
not
knowing
whether
it
was
in
delirium
or
in
reality
some
soft
whispering
voice
ceaselessly
repeating
in
rhythm
pitipitipiti
and
then
titi
and
again
pitipitipiti
and
again
titi
and
at
the
same
time
to
the
sound
of
this
whispering
music
prince
andrei
felt
that
above
his
face
above
the
very
middle
of
it
a
strange
airy
edifice
of
fine
needles
or
splinters
was
being
raised
he
felt
though
it
was
hard
for
him
that
he
had
to
try
to
keep
his
balance
so
that
this
rising
edifice
would
not
collapse
but
even
so
it
kept
collapsing
and
was
raised
again
to
the
sounds
of
the
measured
whispering
music
it
stretches
stretches
stretches
out
and
keeps
stretching
prince
andrei
said
to
himself
while
listening
to
the
whisper
and
feeling
this
stretching
edifice
of
needles
being
raised
prince
andrei
had
glimpses
of
the
red
circle
of
light
around
the
candle
and
heard
the
rustling
of
cockroaches
and
of
the
fly
striking
against
the
pillow
and
his
face
and
each
time
the
fly
touched
his
face
it
made
a
burning
sensation
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
surprised
that
hitting
against
the
very
area
of
his
face
where
the
edifice
was
being
raised
the
fly
did
not
destroy
it
but
besides
that
there
was
something
else
important
it
was
the
white
thing
in
the
doorway
it
was
the
statue
of
a
sphinx
which
also
weighed
on
him
but
maybe
its
my
shirt
on
the
table
thought
prince
andrei
and
these
are
my
legs
and
thats
the
door
but
why
is
everything
stretching
and
thrusting
out
and
pitipitipiti
and
titiand
pitipitipitienough
stop
please
let
me
be
prince
andrei
begged
someone
painfully
and
suddenly
his
thought
and
feeling
emerged
again
with
extraordinary
clarity
and
force
yes
love
he
thought
again
with
perfect
clarity
but
not
the
love
that
loves
for
something
for
some
purpose
or
for
some
reason
but
the
love
i
experienced
for
the
first
time
when
as
i
lay
dying
i
saw
my
enemy
and
loved
him
all
the
same
i
experienced
the
feeling
of
love
which
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
and
which
needs
no
object
now
too
i
am
experiencing
that
blissful
feeling
to
love
my
neighbors
to
love
my
enemies
to
love
everythingto
love
god
in
all
his
manifestations
you
can
love
a
person
dear
to
you
with
a
human
love
but
an
enemy
can
only
be
loved
with
divine
love
thats
why
i
experienced
such
joy
when
i
felt
that
i
loved
that
man
whats
become
of
him
is
he
aliveloving
with
a
human
love
one
can
pass
from
love
to
hatred
but
divine
love
cannot
change
nothing
not
even
death
nothing
can
destroy
it
it
is
the
essence
of
the
soul
but
ive
hated
so
many
people
in
my
life
and
of
all
people
i
have
loved
and
hated
no
one
so
much
as
her
and
he
vividly
pictured
natasha
to
himself
not
as
he
had
pictured
her
before
with
her
loveliness
alone
which
brought
him
joy
but
for
the
first
time
he
pictured
her
soul
and
he
understood
her
feeling
her
suffering
shame
repentance
for
the
first
time
now
he
understood
all
the
cruelty
of
his
refusal
saw
the
cruelty
of
his
break
with
her
if
it
were
possible
to
see
her
just
one
more
time
one
time
looking
into
those
eyes
to
say
and
pitipitipiti
and
titi
and
pitipitiboom
the
fly
struck
and
his
attention
suddenly
raced
on
to
another
world
of
reality
and
delirium
in
which
something
special
was
happening
in
that
world
the
edifice
was
still
being
raised
without
collapsing
something
was
still
stretching
there
was
the
same
circle
of
red
light
around
the
candle
the
same
shirtsphinx
was
lying
by
the
door
but
besides
all
that
something
creaked
there
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
a
new
white
sphinx
appeared
standing
before
the
door
and
the
head
of
this
sphinx
had
the
pale
face
and
shining
eyes
of
that
same
natasha
of
whom
he
had
just
been
thinking
oh
how
painful
this
constant
delirium
is
thought
prince
andrei
trying
to
drive
that
face
from
his
imagination
but
that
face
stood
before
him
with
the
force
of
reality
and
that
face
was
coming
nearer
prince
andrei
wanted
to
return
to
the
former
world
of
pure
thought
but
he
could
not
and
delirium
was
drawing
him
into
its
realm
the
quiet
whispering
voice
continued
its
measured
prattle
something
weighed
on
him
stretched
and
the
strange
face
stood
before
him
prince
andrei
gathered
all
his
forces
so
as
to
keep
his
senses
he
stirred
and
suddenly
there
was
a
ringing
in
his
ears
his
eyes
clouded
and
like
a
man
plunging
into
water
he
lost
consciousness
when
he
came
to
himself
natasha
that
same
living
natasha
whom
of
all
people
in
the
world
he
most
wanted
to
love
with
that
new
pure
divine
love
which
had
now
been
revealed
to
him
was
kneeling
beside
him
he
understood
that
this
was
the
living
real
natasha
and
was
not
surprised
but
quietly
glad
natasha
kneeling
gazed
at
him
fearfully
but
fixedly
she
was
unable
to
move
trying
to
stifle
her
sobs
her
face
was
pale
and
motionless
only
in
the
lower
it
something
trembled
prince
andrei
sighed
with
relief
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
you
he
said
what
happiness
with
a
quick
but
careful
movement
natasha
moved
closer
to
him
on
her
knees
and
carefully
taking
his
hand
bent
her
head
over
it
and
began
to
kiss
it
barely
touching
it
with
her
lips
forgive
me
she
said
in
a
whisper
raising
her
head
and
glancing
at
him
forgive
me
i
love
you
said
prince
andrei
forgive
forgive
what
asked
prince
andrei
forgive
me
for
what
i
didid
natasha
said
in
a
barely
audible
faltering
whisper
and
she
began
to
kiss
his
hand
more
quickly
barely
touching
it
with
her
lips
i
love
you
more
better
than
before
said
prince
andrei
raising
her
face
with
his
hand
so
that
he
could
see
her
eyes
those
eyes
filled
with
happy
tears
looked
at
him
timidly
with
compassion
and
joyful
love
natashas
thin
and
pale
face
with
its
swollen
lips
was
more
than
unattractive
it
was
frightful
but
prince
andrei
did
not
see
that
face
he
saw
radiant
eyes
which
were
beautiful
behind
them
talking
could
be
heard
the
valet
pyotr
now
fully
awake
aroused
the
doctor
timokhin
who
had
not
slept
all
that
time
because
of
the
pain
in
his
leg
had
long
been
watching
everything
that
was
happening
and
fidgeted
on
the
bench
trying
to
keep
his
undressed
body
covered
by
the
sheet
what
is
this
said
the
doctor
getting
up
from
his
bed
kindly
leave
young
lady
just
then
the
maid
sent
by
the
countess
who
had
found
her
daughter
missing
knocked
on
the
door
like
a
somnambulist
awakened
in
the
middle
of
her
sleep
natasha
went
out
of
the
room
and
returning
to
her
side
of
the
cottage
fell
sobbing
on
her
bed
from
that
day
on
through
all
the
rest
of
the
rostovs
journey
at
every
stopping
or
sleeping
place
natasha
never
left
the
wounded
bolkonsky
and
the
doctor
had
to
admit
that
he
had
not
expected
from
a
young
lady
either
such
firmness
or
such
skill
in
looking
after
a
wounded
man
terrible
as
the
thought
seemed
to
the
countess
that
prince
andrei
might
and
according
to
the
doctor
quite
probably
would
die
in
her
daughters
arms
during
the
journey
she
was
unable
to
oppose
natasha
though
it
was
conceivable
that
owing
to
the
closeness
now
established
between
the
wounded
prince
andrei
and
natasha
their
former
engagement
might
be
renewed
in
case
he
recovered
no
one
spoke
of
it
least
of
all
natasha
and
prince
andrei
the
unresolved
question
of
life
and
death
hanging
not
only
over
bolkonsky
but
over
russia
shut
out
all
other
conjectures
xxxiii
pierre
woke
up
late
on
the
third
of
september
his
head
ached
the
clothes
he
had
slept
in
without
undressing
felt
heavy
on
his
body
and
on
his
soul
lay
a
vague
consciousness
of
something
shameful
committed
the
day
before
this
shameful
thing
was
yesterdays
conversation
with
captain
ramballe
the
clock
showed
eleven
but
it
seemed
peculiarly
overcast
outside
pierre
got
up
rubbed
his
eyes
and
seeing
the
pistol
with
its
carved
butt
which
gerasim
had
again
placed
on
the
writing
table
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
precisely
what
lay
before
him
that
day
am
i
already
too
late
thought
pierre
no
he
would
probably
enter
moscow
no
earlier
than
noon
pierre
did
not
allow
himself
to
reflect
on
what
lay
before
him
but
hastened
to
act
quickly
having
straightened
his
clothes
pierre
took
the
pistol
in
his
hand
and
was
about
to
leave
but
here
the
thought
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
of
how
he
was
to
carry
this
weapon
outside
if
not
in
his
hand
even
under
a
loose
kaftan
it
was
hard
to
hide
a
big
pistol
neither
in
his
belt
nor
under
his
arm
was
it
possible
to
carry
it
unnoticed
besides
the
pistol
had
been
fired
and
pierre
had
not
had
time
to
reload
it
never
mind
theres
still
the
dagger
pierre
said
to
himself
though
more
than
once
in
thinking
about
carrying
out
his
intention
he
had
decided
to
himself
that
the
chief
mistake
of
the
student
in
1809
had
consisted
in
wanting
to
kill
napoleon
with
a
dagger
but
as
if
his
main
goal
consisted
not
in
carrying
out
the
thing
he
had
in
mind
but
in
proving
to
himself
that
he
had
not
renounced
his
intention
and
was
doing
everything
to
carry
it
out
pierre
quickly
took
the
dull
nicked
dagger
in
the
green
scabbard
which
he
had
bought
at
the
sukhareva
tower
along
with
the
pistol
and
hid
it
under
his
waistcoat
having
belted
his
kaftan
and
pulled
down
his
hat
pierre
trying
not
to
make
noise
or
meet
the
captain
walked
down
the
corridor
and
went
outside
the
fire
which
he
had
looked
at
so
indifferently
the
evening
before
had
grown
significantly
overnight
now
moscow
was
burning
on
different
sides
carriage
row
zamoskvorechye
the
shopping
arcade
povarskaya
street
the
barges
on
the
moskva
river
and
the
firewood
market
by
the
dorogomilovo
bridge
were
burning
at
the
same
time
pierres
path
lay
through
back
lanes
to
povarskaya
and
from
there
to
the
arbat
to
st
nicholas
the
revealed
which
had
long
been
designated
in
his
imagination
as
the
place
where
his
deed
was
to
be
accomplished
most
of
the
houses
had
their
gates
and
shutters
closed
the
streets
and
lanes
were
deserted
there
was
a
smell
of
smoke
and
burning
in
the
air
now
and
then
he
met
russians
with
anxiously
timid
faces
and
frenchmen
with
a
noncity
camplike
look
walking
down
the
middle
of
the
streets
both
looked
at
pierre
with
astonishment
besides
his
great
height
and
fatness
besides
the
strange
gloomily
concentrated
and
suffering
expression
of
his
face
and
his
whole
figure
the
russians
studied
pierre
with
interest
because
they
could
not
figure
out
what
estate
this
man
might
belong
to
the
french
followed
him
with
astonished
eyes
particularly
because
unlike
all
other
russians
who
looked
at
the
french
with
fear
or
curiosity
pierre
paid
no
attention
to
them
by
the
gates
of
one
house
three
frenchmen
explaining
something
to
some
russians
who
did
not
understand
them
stopped
pierre
to
ask
if
he
knew
french
pierre
shook
his
head
negatively
and
went
on
in
another
lane
a
sentry
standing
by
a
green
box
called
out
to
him
and
only
after
the
repetition
of
the
threatening
cry
and
the
sound
of
the
sentry
cocking
his
musket
did
pierre
understand
that
he
should
go
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
around
him
with
haste
and
horror
he
carried
his
intention
inside
him
like
something
dreadful
and
alien
afraidhaving
been
taught
by
the
previous
nights
experienceof
somehow
losing
it
but
pierre
was
not
destined
to
bring
his
state
of
mind
intact
to
the
place
he
was
heading
for
besides
even
if
nothing
held
him
up
on
his
way
his
intention
could
no
longer
be
carried
out
because
more
than
four
hours
ago
napoleon
had
ridden
from
the
suburb
of
dorogomilovo
down
the
arbat
to
the
kremlin
and
in
the
darkest
mood
was
now
sitting
in
the
tsars
office
in
the
kremlin
palace
issuing
detailed
thorough
instructions
about
the
measures
to
be
taken
immediately
to
put
out
the
fires
prevent
looting
and
reassure
the
inhabitants
but
pierre
did
not
know
that
entirely
absorbed
by
what
lay
before
him
he
suffered
as
people
suffer
who
stubbornly
undertake
something
impossiblenot
because
of
its
difficulty
but
because
of
its
unsuitability
to
their
nature
he
suffered
from
fear
that
he
would
weaken
at
the
decisive
moment
and
as
a
result
would
lose
repect
for
himself
though
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
around
him
he
found
his
way
by
instinct
and
without
mistake
took
the
lanes
that
led
him
to
povarskaya
as
pierre
approached
povarskaya
the
smoke
became
thicker
and
thicker
and
it
even
became
warm
from
the
flames
of
the
fire
fiery
tongues
occasionally
soared
up
from
behind
the
roofs
of
the
houses
there
were
more
people
in
the
streets
and
those
people
were
more
alarmed
but
though
he
felt
that
something
extraordinary
was
happening
around
him
he
was
not
aware
that
he
was
approaching
the
fire
walking
down
a
path
that
led
across
a
big
vacant
lot
adjoining
povarskaya
on
one
side
and
the
gardens
of
prince
gruzinskys
house
on
the
other
pierre
suddenly
heard
a
womans
desperate
cry
just
next
to
him
he
stopped
as
if
awakening
from
sleep
and
raised
his
head
by
the
side
of
the
path
on
the
dry
dusty
grass
lay
a
heap
of
household
belongings
featherbeds
a
samovar
icons
and
trunks
on
the
ground
by
the
trunks
sat
a
thin
middleaged
woman
with
long
protruding
front
teeth
dressed
in
a
black
coat
and
bonnet
this
woman
rocking
and
muttering
something
was
weeping
heartrendingly
two
girls
between
ten
and
twelve
years
old
dressed
in
dirty
short
dresses
and
coats
looked
at
their
mother
with
an
expression
of
perplexity
on
their
pale
frightened
faces
a
smaller
boy
about
seven
years
old
in
a
long
coat
and
someone
elses
oversized
cap
was
weeping
in
the
arms
of
an
old
nanny
a
dirty
barefooted
wench
was
sitting
on
a
trunk
and
having
undone
her
pale
braid
was
pulling
off
the
singed
hairs
and
smelling
them
the
husband
a
short
stoopshouldered
man
in
a
civil
uniform
with
wheelshaped
sidewhiskers
and
smooth
temples
which
could
be
seen
from
under
the
peaked
cap
that
sat
straight
on
his
head
with
an
immobile
face
was
pushing
a
trunks
piled
one
on
the
other
and
pulling
some
sort
of
clothing
out
from
under
them
the
woman
almost
threw
herself
at
pierres
feet
when
she
saw
him

to

only
so
as
to

on

and
turning
to
pierre
there

a
fire

and
it
leaped
over
to
us
the

long
teeth

pierre
said
hurriedly
in
a
breathless
voice
the
dirty
wench
came
from
behind
the
trunk
fixed
up
her
braid
sighed
and
walked
down
the
path
on
her
blunt
bare
feet
pierre
was
as
if
he
had
come
to
life
after
a
heavy
swoon
he
raised
his
head
higher
his
eyes
lit
up
with
a
gleam
of
life
and
he
followed
the
maid
with
quick
steps
overtook
her
and
came
out
on
povarskaya
the
whole
street
was
covered
with
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
here
and
there
tongues
of
flame
burst
from
this
cloud
a
large
crowd
of
people
thronged
in
front
of
the
fire
a
french
general
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
street
saying
something
to
those
around
him
pierre
accompanied
by
the
maid
wanted
to
reach
the
place
where
the
general
was
standing
but
french
soldiers
stopped
him
on
ne
passe
pas
a
voice
cried
to
him
this
way
mister
said
the
maid
well
take
the
lane
past
the
nikulins
pierre
turned
around
and
walked
on
skipping
now
and
then
to
keep
up
with
her
the
maid
crossed
the
street
turned
left
into
the
lane
went
past
three
houses
and
turned
right
through
the
gates
its
just
here
said
the
maid
and
running
across
the
courtyard
she
opened
a
little
gate
in
a
wooden
fence
and
stopping
pointed
pierre
to
a
small
wooden
wing
that
was
burning
brightly
and
hotly
one
side
of
it
had
collapsed
the
other
was
burning
and
bright
flames
burst
from
the
window
holes
and
from
under
the
roof
when
pierre
went
through
the
gate
a
wave
of
heat
hit
him
and
he
involuntarily
stopped
which
which
is
your
house
he
asked
oooh
the
girl
wailed
pointing
to
the
wing
that
one
that
was
our
place
youre
burned
up
my
little
treasure
katechka
my
precious
little
miss
oooh
wailed
aniska
looking
at
the
fire
and
feeling
a
need
to
show
her
feelings
as
well
pierre
tried
to
get
to
the
wing
but
the
heat
was
so
intense
that
he
involuntarily
swerved
around
the
wing
and
ended
up
by
the
main
house
which
was
burning
only
on
one
side
of
the
roof
and
around
which
a
crowd
of
frenchmen
swarmed
at
first
pierre
did
not
understand
what
these
frenchmen
who
were
dragging
something
out
were
doing
but
seeing
a
frenchman
in
front
of
him
who
was
beating
a
muzhik
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
trying
to
take
a
fox
fur
coat
from
him
pierre
vaguely
realized
that
looting
was
going
on
there
but
he
had
no
time
to
stop
at
that
thought
the
sound
of
cracking
and
the
crash
of
falling
walls
and
ceilings
the
whistling
and
hissing
of
the
flames
and
the
lively
cries
of
the
people
the
sight
of
billowing
clouds
of
smoke
now
frowningly
thick
and
black
now
soaring
up
brightly
with
flashes
of
sparks
and
here
and
there
of
solid
sheaflike
red
or
scaly
golden
flames
creeping
over
the
walls
the
sensation
of
heat
and
smoke
and
quick
movement
produced
on
pierre
the
usual
exhilarating
effect
of
fires
this
effect
was
especially
strong
on
him
because
at
the
sight
of
this
fire
he
suddenly
felt
freed
of
his
burdensome
thoughts
he
felt
young
cheerful
adroit
and
resolute
he
ran
around
the
little
wing
from
the
direction
of
the
house
and
was
about
to
run
to
the
it
that
was
still
standing
when
just
by
his
head
he
heard
the
cries
of
several
voices
and
after
that
the
crash
and
clang
of
something
heavy
falling
next
to
him
pierre
turned
to
look
and
saw
frenchmen
in
the
windows
of
the
house
throwing
out
the
drawer
of
a
chest
filled
with
some
sort
of
metal
objects
other
french
soldiers
standing
on
the
ground
went
up
to
the
drawer
eh

one
of
the
frenchman
called
out
to
pierre

voices
said
and
one
of
the
soldiers
probably
fearing
that
pierre
would
start
taking
from
them
the
silver
and
bronze
that
were
in
the
drawer
moved
towards
him
menacingly
un

a
frenchman
shouted
from
above

the
frenchman
called
from
the
window
pointing
to
the
garden
behind
the
house
attendez

vais
descendre
and
in
fact
a
moment
later
the
frenchman
a
darkeyed
fellow
with
a
spot
on
his
cheek
in
his
shirtsleeves
jumped
out
of
a
groundfloor
window
and
slapping
pierre
on
the
shoulder
ran
to
the
garden
with
him
d233p234chezvous

he
cried
to
his
comrades
il

having
run
behind
the
house
onto
a
sandstrewn
path
the
frenchman
pulled
pierre
by
the
arm
and
pointed
him
to
the
circle
under
a
garden
bench
lay
a
threeyearold
girl
in
a
pink
dress

said
the
frenchman
au

and
the
frenchman
with
the
spot
on
his
cheek
ran
back
to
his
comrades
pierre
breathless
with
joy
ran
to
the
girl
and
wanted
to
pick
her
up
but
seeing
a
stranger
the
sickly
scrofulous
unpleasantlooking
little
girl
who
resembled
her
mother
screamed
and
tried
to
run
away
pierre
picked
her
up
anyhow
and
took
her
in
his
arms
she
shrieked
in
a
desperately
angry
voice
and
began
tearing
pierres
hands
away
with
her
own
little
hands
and
biting
them
with
her
slobbery
mouth
pierre
was
seized
by
a
feeling
of
horror
and
squeamishness
such
as
he
had
experienced
on
touching
some
little
animal
but
he
forced
himself
not
to
drop
the
child
and
ran
with
her
back
to
the
big
house
but
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
go
back
the
same
way
the
wench
aniska
was
not
there
and
pierre
with
a
feeling
of
pity
and
revulsion
pressing
the
suffering
sobbing
and
wet
little
girl
to
him
as
tenderly
as
he
could
ran
through
the
garden
to
look
for
another
way
out
xxxiv
when
pierre
having
run
around
through
courtyards
and
lanes
got
back
with
his
burden
to
the
gruzinskys
garden
at
the
corner
of
povarskaya
he
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
place
from
which
he
had
gone
to
look
for
the
child
it
was
so
cluttered
with
people
and
belongings
taken
from
the
house
besides
russian
families
with
their
chattels
escaped
from
the
fire
there
were
also
several
french
soldiers
in
various
dress
pierre
paid
no
attention
to
them
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
find
the
officials
family
so
as
to
give
the
daughter
to
the
mother
and
go
again
to
save
someone
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
he
had
to
do
much
more
of
something
and
do
it
quickly
flushed
from
the
heat
and
the
running
pierre
at
that
moment
experienced
even
more
strongly
than
before
that
feeling
of
youth
animation
and
determination
which
had
taken
hold
of
him
as
he
was
running
to
save
the
child
the
girl
had
quieted
down
now
and
holding
on
to
pierres
kaftan
with
her
little
hands
sat
on
his
arm
and
looked
around
like
a
wild
animal
pierre
occasionally
glanced
at
her
and
smiled
slightly
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
something
touchingly
innocent
and
angelic
in
that
frightened
and
sickly
little
face
neither
the
official
nor
his
wife
were
in
the
former
place
now
pierre
strode
quickly
among
the
people
looking
at
various
faces
he
came
upon
he
involuntarily
noticed
a
georgian
or
armenian
family
which
consisted
of
a
very
old
handsome
man
with
a
face
of
the
oriental
type
dressed
in
a
new
furlined
coat
and
new
boots
an
old
woman
of
the
same
type
and
a
young
woman
this
very
young
woman
seemed
to
pierre
the
perfection
of
oriental
beauty
with
her
sharply
outlined
arched
eyebrows
and
long
face
of
an
extraordinarily
delicate
pink
beautiful
and
expressionless
among
the
scattered
belongings
in
the
crowd
on
the
square
she
in
her
costly
satincovered
winter
coat
and
bright
purple
shawl
which
covered
her
head
resembled
a
tender
hothouse
flower
thrown
out
on
the
snow
she
sat
on
some
bundles
slightly
behind
the
old
woman
and
her
big
dark
elongated
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
looked
motionlessly
at
the
ground
she
clearly
knew
her
own
beauty
and
feared
for
it
her
face
struck
pierre
and
hastening
along
the
fence
he
turned
several
times
to
look
at
her
on
reaching
the
fence
and
still
not
finding
those
he
wanted
pierre
stood
looking
around
the
figure
of
pierre
with
the
child
in
his
arms
was
now
even
more
noticeable
than
before
and
several
russian
men
and
women
gathered
around
him
have
you
lost
someone
dear
man
youre
a
gentleman
yourself
arent
you
whose
child
is
it
he
was
asked
pierre
replied
that
the
child
belonged
to
a
woman
in
a
black
coat
who
had
been
sitting
in
that
place
with
her
children
and
asked
if
anyone
knew
her
and
where
she
had
gone
that
must
be
the
anferovs
said
an
old
deacon
addressing
a
pockmarked
woman
lord
have
mercy
lord
have
mercy
he
added
in
an
accustomed
bass
what
anferovs
said
the
old
woman
the
anferovs
left
in
the
morning
it
must
be
either
marya
nikolavna
or
the
ivanovs
he
says
it
was
a
woman
but
marya
nikolavna
is
a
lady
said
a
servant
you
must
know
herlong
teeth
thin
said
pierre
thats
marya
nikolavna
they
went
to
the
garden
when
these
wolves
swooped
down
on
us
said
the
woman
pointing
to
the
french
soldiers
oh
lord
have
mercy
the
deacon
added
again
go
that
way
theyre
over
there
its
her
she
kept
grieving
weeping
the
woman
said
again
its
her
over
there
but
pierre
was
not
listening
to
the
woman
for
several
seconds
now
not
taking
his
eyes
away
he
had
been
watching
what
was
going
on
a
few
steps
from
him
he
had
been
watching
the
armenian
family
and
two
french
soldiers
who
had
gone
up
to
them
one
of
the
soldiers
a
fidgety
little
man
was
wearing
a
dark
blue
greatcoat
tied
with
a
rope
there
was
a
cap
on
his
head
his
feet
were
bare
the
other
who
especially
struck
pierre
was
a
tall
stooping
thin
flaxenhaired
man
with
sluggish
movements
and
an
idiotic
expression
on
his
face
this
one
was
dressed
in
a
long
frieze
coat
dark
blue
trousers
and
big
torn
jackboots
the
bootless
little
frenchman
in
the
dark
blue
greatcoat
went
up
to
the
armenians
said
something
and
at
once
took
hold
of
the
old
mans
legs
and
the
old
man
at
once
began
to
take
off
his
boots
the
other
one
in
the
womans
coat
stood
in
front
of
the
beautiful
armenian
girl
and
looked
at
her
silently
fixedly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
take
the
child
take
her
said
pierre
addressing
the
woman
peremptorily
and
hurriedly
and
handing
her
the
girl
give
her
to
them
he
almost
shouted
at
the
woman
sitting
the
screaming
little
girl
on
the
ground
and
he
again
looked
at
the
frenchmen
and
the
armenian
family
the
old
man
was
already
sitting
without
his
boots
the
little
frenchman
had
taken
the
remaining
boot
off
him
and
was
slapping
the
two
boots
against
each
other
the
old
man
sobbing
was
saying
something
but
pierre
saw
it
only
fleetingly
his
whole
attention
was
turned
to
the
frenchman
in
the
long
coat
who
meanwhile
moved
towards
the
young
woman
swaying
slowly
and
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
put
them
to
her
neck
the
armenian
beauty
went
on
sitting
in
the
same
motionless
position
with
her
long
lashes
lowered
as
if
she
did
not
see
or
feel
what
the
soldier
was
doing
to
her
while
pierre
was
running
the
few
steps
that
separated
him
from
the
frenchman
the
tall
looter
in
the
long
coat
was
already
tearing
the
necklace
that
the
armenian
girl
was
wearing
from
her
neck
and
the
young
woman
seizing
her
neck
with
her
hands
cried
out
in
a
piercing
voice
laissez
cette
femme
pierre
rasped
in
a
furious
voice
seizing
the
tall
stooping
soldier
by
the
shoulders
and
flinging
him
away
the
soldier
fell
got
up
and
ran
off
but
his
comrade
throwing
down
the
boots
drew
his
sword
and
moved
threateningly
towards
pierre
voyons
pas
de
b234tises
he
cried
pierre
was
in
that
ecstasy
of
fury
in
which
he
was
oblivious
to
everything
and
his
strength
increased
tenfold
he
fell
upon
the
barefoot
frenchman
and
before
he
had
time
to
draw
his
sword
had
already
knocked
him
off
his
feet
and
was
pummeling
him
with
his
fists
an
approving
cry
came
from
the
surrounding
crowd
and
at
the
same
time
a
mounted
patrol
of
french
uhlans
appeared
from
around
the
corner
the
uhlans
trotted
up
to
pierre
and
the
frenchman
and
surrounded
them
pierre
remembered
nothing
of
what
came
after
that
he
remembered
beating
something
being
beaten
and
in
the
end
felt
that
his
hands
were
tied
and
that
a
crowd
of
french
soldiers
was
standing
around
him
searching
his
clothes
il
a
un
poignard
lieutenant
were
the
first
words
pierre
understood
ah
une
arme
said
the
officer
and
he
turned
to
the
barefoot
soldier
who
had
been
taken
together
with
pierre
cest
bon
vous
direz
tout
cela
au
conseil
de
guerre
said
the
officer
and
then
he
turned
to
pierre
parlezvous
fran231ais
vous
pierre
looked
around
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
did
not
reply
his
face
probably
looked
very
frightful
because
the
officer
said
something
in
a
whisper
and
four
more
uhlans
separated
from
the
unit
and
stood
on
either
side
of
pierre
parlezvous
fran231ais
the
officer
repeated
the
question
keeping
his
distance
from
him
faites
venir
linterpr232te
a
little
man
in
russian
civil
dress
rode
out
of
the
ranks
by
his
clothes
and
pronunciation
pierre
recognized
him
at
once
as
a
frenchman
from
one
of
the
moscow
shops
il
na
pas
lair
dun
homme
du
peuple
said
the
interpreter
looking
pierre
over
oh
oh
231a
ma
bien
lair
dun
des
incendiaires
said
the
officer
demandezlui
ce
quil
est
he
added
who
you
asked
the
interpreter
you
must
answer
the
superiority
he
said
je
ne
vous
dirai
pas
qui
je
suis
je
suis
votre
prisonnier
emm232nemoi
pierre
suddenly
said
in
french
ah
ah
said
the
officer
frowning
marchons
a
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
uhlans
closest
to
pierre
stood
the
pockmarked
woman
with
the
girl
when
the
patrol
started
off
she
moved
forward
where
are
they
taking
you
my
dearest
she
asked
the
girl
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
girl
if
shes
not
theirs
said
the
woman
questce
quelle
veut
cette
femme
asked
the
officer
pierre
was
like
a
drunk
man
his
ecstatic
state
increased
still
more
at
the
sight
of
the
girl
he
had
saved
ce
quelle
dit
he
said
elle
mapporte
ma
fille
que
je
viens
de
sauver
des
flammes
he
said
adieu
and
not
knowing
himself
how
this
pointless
lie
had
escaped
him
he
walked
with
resolute
solemn
steps
between
the
frenchmen
the
french
patrol
was
one
of
those
that
had
been
sent
out
on
durosnels
orders
to
various
streets
in
moscow
to
stop
looting
and
especially
to
catch
the
incendiaries
who
in
the
general
opinion
for
that
day
among
the
french
higher
command
were
the
cause
of
the
fires
having
gone
around
a
few
streets
the
patrol
had
picked
up
some
five
more
suspicious
russiansone
shopkeeper
two
seminarians
a
muzhik
a
servantand
a
few
looters
but
of
all
the
suspicious
people
pierre
seemed
the
most
suspicious
when
they
were
all
taken
to
spend
the
night
in
a
big
house
on
the
zubovsky
rampart
where
a
guardhouse
had
been
set
up
pierre
was
placed
separately
under
strict
guard
i
in
petersburg
in
the
highest
circles
a
complex
struggle
was
going
on
with
greater
heat
than
ever
between
the
parties
of
rumyantsev
the
french
maria
feodorovna
the
grand
duke
and
others
drowned
as
always
by
the
humming
of
the
court
drones
but
the
calm
luxurious
life
of
petersburg
concerned
only
with
phantoms
with
reflections
of
life
went
on
as
of
old
and
beyond
this
course
of
life
it
took
great
effort
to
realize
the
danger
and
the
difficult
situation
the
russian
people
were
in
there
were
the
same
levees
and
balls
the
same
french
theater
the
same
interests
of
the
courts
the
same
interests
of
the
service
and
intrigues
only
in
the
very
highest
circles
were
efforts
made
to
keep
in
mind
the
difficulty
of
the
present
situation
it
was
recounted
in
whispers
how
differently
from
each
other
the
two
empresses
behaved
in
these
difficult
circumstances
the
empress
maria
feodorovna
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
the
almshouses
and
orphanages
in
her
charge
made
arrangements
to
move
all
the
institutions
to
kazan
and
the
belongings
of
these
establishments
had
already
been
packed
the
empress
elizaveta
alexeevna
however
to
the
question
of
what
orders
she
would
be
pleased
to
give
kindly
replied
with
characteristic
russian
patriotism
that
she
could
give
no
orders
about
state
institutions
since
that
was
the
sovereigns
concern
as
for
what
depended
on
her
personally
she
kindly
replied
that
she
would
be
the
last
to
leave
petersburg
on
the
twentysixth
of
august
the
very
day
of
the
battle
of
borodino
anna
pavlovna
had
a
soir233e
the
centerpiece
of
which
was
to
be
the
reading
of
a
letter
from
the
metropolitan
written
on
the
occasion
of
sending
the
sovereign
an
icon
of
st
sergius
this
letter
was
considered
a
model
of
patriotic
spiritual
eloquence
it
was
to
be
read
by
prince
vassily
famous
for
his
artistic
recitations
he
also
used
to
read
at
the
empresss
artistic
recitation
consisted
in
pouring
out
words
loudly
melodiously
alternating
between
a
desperate
howl
and
a
tender
murmur
quite
regardless
of
their
meaning
so
that
it
was
quite
by
chance
that
one
word
fell
in
with
the
howling
and
others
with
the
murmuring
this
reading
like
all
of
anna
pavlovnas
soir233es
had
a
political
significance
several
important
persons
were
to
be
there
who
had
to
be
shamed
for
going
to
the
french
theater
and
inspired
with
patriotic
sentiments
a
good
many
people
had
already
gathered
but
anna
pavlovna
still
did
not
see
everyone
she
needed
in
her
drawing
room
and
therefore
would
not
let
the
reading
begin
but
initiated
a
general
conversation
the
news
of
the
day
for
that
day
in
petersburg
was
the
illness
of
countess
bezukhov
several
days
earlier
the
countess
had
unexpectedly
fallen
ill
had
missed
several
gatherings
of
which
she
was
the
adornment
and
rumor
had
it
that
she
was
not
receiving
anyone
and
that
instead
of
the
famous
petersburg
doctors
who
usually
treated
her
she
had
entrusted
herself
to
some
italian
doctor
who
was
treating
her
in
some
new
and
unusual
way
everyone
knew
very
well
that
the
lovely
countesss
illness
came
from
the
inconvenience
of
marrying
two
husbands
at
once
and
that
the
italians
treatment
consisted
in
removing
that
inconvenience
but
in
anna
pavlovnas
presence
not
only
did
no
one
dare
to
think
about
it
but
it
was
as
if
no
one
knew
it
on
dit
que
la
pauvre
comtesse

mal
le
m233decin
dit

on
dit
que

224
langine
the
word
angine
was
repeated
with
great
pleasure
le

ce

dit
il
a
pleur233
comme
un
enfant
quand
le

oh

oh
sans

cest

charmante
femme

said
anna
pavlovna
with
a
smile
at
her
own
rapturousness
nous

mais
cela
ne
memp234che
pas
de
l233stimer
comme
elle
le
m233rite
elle
est
bien
malheureuse
anna
pavlovna
added
supposing
that
by
these
words
anna
pavlovna
had
slightly
lifted
the
veil
of
secrecy
over
the
countesss
illness
one
imprudent
young
man
allowed
himself
to
express
surprise
that
instead
of
calling
in
famous
doctors
the
countess
was
being
treated
by
a
charlatan
who
might
give
her
dangerous
remedies
vos
informations
peuvent
234tre
meilleures
que
les
miennes
anna
pavlovna
suddenly
fell
venomously
upon
the
inexperienced
young
man
mais
je
sais
de
bonne
source
que
ce
m233decin
est
un
homme
tr232s
savant
et
tr232s
habile
cest
le
m233decin
intime

la

despagne
and
having
thus
annihilated
the
young
man
anna
pavlovna
turned
to
bilibin
who
in
another
circle
having
gathered
his
skin
and
clearly
preparing
to
release
it
again
in
order
to
utter
un
mot
was
talking
about
the
austrians
je
trouve
que
cest
charmant
he
said
of
a
diplomatic
paper
sent
to
vienna
together
with
the
austrian
standards
taken
by
wittgenstein
le
h233ros
de
p233tropol
as
he
was
known
in
petersburg
how
how
is
that
anna
pavlovna
addressed
him
inducing
silence
for
the
hearing
of
the
mot
which
she
already
knew
and
bilibin
repeated
the
following
actual
words
from
the
diplomatic
dispatch
he
had
composed
lempereur
renvoie
les
drapeaux
autrichiens
said
bilibin
drapeaux

et
233gar233s
quil

bilibin
concluded
releasing
his
skin
charmant
charmant
said
prince
vassily
cest
la

varsovie
peut234tre
prince
ippolit
said
loudly
and
unexpectedly
everyone
turned
to
him
not
understanding
what
he
meant
to
say
by
that
prince
ippolit
also
looked
around
with
merry
surprise
like
everyone
else
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
he
had
spoken
in
the
course
of
his
diplomatic
career
he
had
noticed
more
than
once
that
words
spoken
suddenly
like
that
turned
out
to
be
very
witty
and
just
in
case
he
had
spoken
these
words
the
first
that
came
to
his
tongue
maybe
it
will
turn
out
very
well
he
thought
and
if
it
doesnt
theyll
be
able
to
fix
things
up
indeed
during
the
awkward
silence
that
ensued
the
insufficiently
patriotic
person
whom
anna
pavlovna
was
waiting
for
in
order
to
convert
came
in
and
she
smiling
and
shaking
her
finger
at
ippolit
invited
prince
vassily
to
the
table
and
giving
him
two
candles
and
the
manuscript
asked
him
to
begin
everything
became
silent
most
gracious
sovereign
emperor
prince
vassily
proclaimed
sternly
and
looked
the
public
over
as
if
asking
if
anyone
had
anything
to
say
against
it
but
no
one
said
anything
the
first
capital
moscow
the
new
jerusalem
receives
her
christ
he
suddenly
emphasized
the
word
her
as
a
mother
her
zealous
sons
into
her
embrace
and
through
the
gathering
darkness
foreseeing
the
brilliant
glory
of
thy
dominion
sings
in
ecstasy
hosanna
blessed
is
he
that
comes
these
last
words
prince
vassily
uttered
in
a
tearful
voice
bilibin
was
attentively
examining
his
fingernails
and
many
clearly
grown
timid
seemed
to
be
asking
what
they
were
guilty
of
anna
pavlovna
like
a
little
old
woman
repeating
the
prayer
before
communion
whispered
in
advance
let
the
brazen
and
insolent

prince
vassily
continued
let
the
brazen

from
the
borders
of

encompass
the
ends
of

in
deathly
horror
meek

of

heard
in
praise
of

and

inspired
by
this
speech
anna

guests
talked
for
a
long
time
about
the
situation
of
the

and
made
various
conjectures
about

outcome

to
be

one
of

pavlovnas
presentiment
indeed
proved
true
the
next
day
during
the
prayer
service
in
the
palace
on
the
occasion
of
the
sovereigns
birthday
prince
volkonsky
was
called
out
of
the
church
and
received
an
envelope
from
prince
kutuzov
this
was
kutuzovs
report
written
from
tatarinovo
on
the
day
of
the
battle
kutuzov
wrote
that
the
russians
had
not
retreated
a
step
that
the
french
losses
were
much
greater
than
ours
that
he
was
reporting
in
haste
from
the
battlefield
and
had
not
yet
had
time
to
gather
the
latest
information
which
meant
it
was
a
victory
and
at
once
before
leaving
church
thanks
were
offered
up
to
the
creator
for
his
help
and
for
the
victory
anna
pavlovnas
presentiment
proved
true
and
for
the
whole
morning
a
joyfully
festive
mood
reigned
in
the
city
everyone
took
the
victory
for
an
accomplished
fact
and
some
already
spoke
of
the
capture
of
napoleon
himself
of
his
deposition
and
the
choice
of
a
new
head
for
france
far
from
the
action
and
amidst
the
conditions
of
court
life
one
could
hardly
expect
events
to
be
reflected
in
all
their
fullness
and
force
involuntarily
general
events
group
themselves
around
some
specific
occurrence
so
now
the
main
joy
of
the
courtiers
consisted
as
much
in
the
fact
that
news
of
the
victory
arrived
precisely
on
the
sovereigns
birthday
as
in
the
fact
that
we
had
been
victorious
this
was
like
a
successful
surprise
in
kutuzovs
report
mention
was
also
made
of
the
russian
losses
and
among
them
tuchkov
bagration
and
kutaisov
were
named
the
sad
side
of
the
event
in
the
local
petersburg
world
also
involuntarily
grouped
itself
around
one
event
the
death
of
kutaisov
everyone
knew
him
the
sovereign
liked
him
he
was
young
and
interesting
on
that
day
people
met
each
other
with
the
words
how
surprisingly
it
happened
during
the
prayer
service
but
what
a
loss
kutaisov
is
ah
what
a
pity
what
did
i
tell
you
about
kutuzov
prince
vassily
now
kept
saying
with
the
pride
of
a
prophet
i
always
said
he
alone
was
capable
of
defeating
napoleon
but
the
next
day
no
news
came
from
the
army
and
the
general
voice
became
anxious
the
courtiers
suffered
over
the
suffering
of
uncertainty
in
which
the
sovereign
found
himself
what
a
position
the
sovereign
is
in
said
the
courtiers
and
they
no
longer
extolled
kutuzov
as
they
had
the
day
before
but
denounced
him
for
being
the
cause
of
the
sovereigns
worry
that
day
prince
vassily
no
longer
boasted
of
his
prot233g233
kutuzov
but
kept
silent
when
the
conversation
turned
to
the
commander
in
chief
besides
towards
the
evening
of
that
day
it
was
as
if
everything
combined
to
plunge
the
inhabitants
of
petersburg
into
anxiety
and
worry
one
more
piece
of
terrible
news
was
added
countess
elena
bezukhov
had
died
suddenly
of
that
terrible
illness
the
name
of
which
it
had
been
so
pleasant
to
articulate
officially
in
large
gatherings
everyone
said
that
countess
bezukhov
had
died
of
a
terrible
attack
of
angine
pectorale
but
in
intimate
circles
details
were
recounted
of
how
le
m233decin
intime
de
la
reine
despagne
had
prescribed
h233l232ne
small
doses
of
some
medicine
to
produce
a
certain
effect
but
h233l232ne
tormented
by
the
old
counts
suspicions
and
by
the
fact
that
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
written
that
wretched
depraved
pierre
would
not
answer
her
had
suddenly
taken
a
huge
dose
of
the
prescribed
medicine
and
had
died
in
agony
before
aid
could
be
given
the
story
went
that
prince
vassily
and
the
old
count
were
about
to
set
upon
the
italian
but
the
italian
showed
them
such
notes
from
the
unfortunate
deceased
woman
that
they
let
him
go
at
once
general
conversation
concentrated
itself
around
three
grievous
events
the
sovereigns
uncertainty
the
loss
of
kutaisov
and
the
death
of
h233l232ne
on
the
third
day
after
kutuzovs
report
a
landowner
arrived
in
petersburg
from
moscow
and
the
news
spread
throughout
the
city
about
the
surrender
of
moscow
to
the
french
this
was
terrible
imagine
the
sovereigns
position
kutuzov
was
a
traitor
and
prince
vassily
during
the
visites
de
condol233ances
paid
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
daughters
death
said
of
the
formerly
praised
kutuzov
it
was
forgivable
for
him
in
his
sorrow
to
forget
what
he
had
said
before
that
nothing
else
could
have
been
expected
from
a
blind
and
depraved
old
man
im
only
surprised
that
the
destiny
of
russia
could
have
been
entrusted
to
such
a
man
as
long
as
this
news
remained
unofficial
it
could
still
be
doubted
but
the
next
day
the
following
report
came
from
count
rastopchin
prince
kutuzovs
adjutant
has
brought
me
a
letter
in
which
he
requests
police
officers
from
me
to
lead
the
army
to
the
ryazan
road
he
says
that
he
is
abandoning
moscow
with
regret
sovereign
kutuzovs
action
decides
the
fate
of
the
capital
and
of
your
empire
russia
will
shudder
on
learning
that
the
city
in
which
russias
greatness
is
centered
where
the
remains
of
your
ancestors
lie
is
given
up
to
the
enemy
i
will
follow
the
army
i
have
evacuated
everything
all
that
is
left
for
me
is
to
weep
over
the
fate
of
my
fatherland
having
received
this
report
the
sovereign
sent
prince
volkonsky
to
kutuzov
with
the
following
rescript
prince
mikhail
ilarionovich
i
have
had
no
reports
from
you
since
august
29
meanwhile
i
received
on
september
1
through
yaroslavl
from
the
moscow
commander
in
chief
the
grievous
news
that
you
and
the
army
have
decided
to
abandon
moscow
you
can
imagine
the
effect
that
this
news
has
made
on
me
and
your
silence
redoubles
my
astonishment
i
am
sending
this
by
my
adjutant
general
prince
volkonsky
in
order
to
learn
from
you
the
situation
of
the
army
and
the
reasons
that
prompted
you
to
such
a
grievous
resolution
iii
nine
days
after
moscow
was
abandoned
a
messenger
sent
by
kutuzov
reached
petersburg
with
an
official
announcement
that
moscow
had
been
abandoned
this
messenger
was
the
frenchman
michaud
who
did
not
know
russian
but
quoique
233tranger
russe
de
coeur
et
d226me
as
he
said
of
himself
the
sovereign
received
the
messenger
at
once
in
his
office
in
the
palace
on
kamenny
island
michaud
who
had
never
seen
moscow
before
the
campaign
and
who
did
not
know
russian
all
the
same
felt
deeply
moved
when
he
appeared
before
notre
tr232s
gracieux
souverain
as
he
wrote
with
news
of
the
moscow
fire
dont
les
flammes
233clairaient
sa
route
though
the
source
of
mr
michauds
chagrin
was
bound
to
be
different
from
that
which
caused
the
grief
of
russian
people
michaud
when
he
was
led
to
the
sovereigns
office
had
such
a
mournful
face
that
the
sovereign
asked
him
at
once
mapportezvous
de
tristes
nouvelles
colonel
bien
tristes
sire
replied
michaud
lowering
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
labandon
de
moscou
auraiton
livr233
mon
ancienne
capitale
sans
se
battre
the
sovereign
said
quickly
suddenly
flushing
michaud
respectfully
conveyed
what
he
had
been
ordered
to
convey
from
kutuzovnamely
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
fight
near
moscow
and
that
as
one
choice
remained
to
lose
both
the
army
and
moscow
or
moscow
alone
the
field
marshal
had
to
choose
the
latter
the
sovereign
listened
silently
without
looking
at
michaud
lennemi

he
asked
oui
sire
et
elle
est
en

224
lheure

michaud
said
resolutely
but
glancing
at
the
sovereign
michaud
was
horrified
at
what
he
had
done
the
sovereign
began
to
breathe
heavily
and
quickly
his
lower
lip
trembled
and
his
beautiful
blue
eyes
instantly
became
moist
with
tears
but
this
lasted
only
a
moment
the
sovereign
suddenly
frowned
as
if
disapproving
of
himself
for
his
weakness
and
raising
his
head
he
addressed
michaud
in
a
firm
voice
je
vois
colonel
par
tout
ce
qui
nous
arrive
he
said

seeing
that
his
tr232s
gracieux
souverain
had
calmed
down
michaud
also
calmed
down
but
he
had
not
yet
had
time
to
prepare
an
answer
to
the
direct
and
essential
question
of
the
sovereign
which
also
required
a
direct
answer
sire
me
permettrezvous
de
vous

he
said
to
gain
time
colonel
je

said
the
sovereign
ne
me
cachez

je
veux
savoir
absolument
ce

said
michaud
with
a
fine
barely
perceptible
smile
on
his
lips
having
had
time
to
prepare
his
answer
in
the
form
of
a
light
and
respectful

the
sovereign
interrupted
with
a
stern
frown

michaud
was
only
waiting
for
that
in
order
to
put
in
his
play
on
words
sire
he
said
with
a
respectful
playfulness
of
expression

combien

ah
the
sovereign
said
calmly
now
and
with
a
benign
twinkle
in
his
eyes
slapping
michaud
on
the
shoulder
vous
me
tranquillisez
colonel
the
sovereign
lowered
his
head
and
was
silent
for
a
time
eh
bien

he
said
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
addressing
michaud
with
a
benign
and
majestic
gesture
et

the
sovereign
spoke
with
ever
increasing
animation
mais

233crit
dans

he
said
raising
to
heaven
his
beautiful
meek
eyes
shining
with
emotion

having
spoken
these
words
in
an
agitated
voice
the
sovereign
suddenly
turned
away
as
if
wishing
to
conceal
from
michaud
the
tears
that
had
come
to
his
eyes
and
went
further
into
his
office
having
stood
there
for
a
few
moments
he
returned
to
michaud
with
big
strides
and
with
a
forceful
gesture
pressed
his
arm
below
the
elbow
the
sovereigns
beautiful
meek
face
became
flushed
and
his
eyes
burned
with
the
fire
of
resolution
and
wrath

and
the
sovereign
frowned
and
fell
silent
hearing
these
words
seeing
the
expression
of
firm
resolution
in
the
sovereigns
eyes
michaud
quoique
233tranger
mais
russe

et
d226me
felt
himself
at
this
moment
enthousiasm233
par
tout
ce
quil
venait
dentendre
as
he
said
afterwards
and
he
expressed
in
the
following
terms
his
own
feelings
as
well
as
the
feelings
of
the
russian
people
of
whom
he
regarded
himself
as
the
plenipotentiary
sire
he
said
votre
majest233
signe
dans
ce
moment
la
gloire
de
la
nation
et
le
salut
de
leurope
the
sovereign
inclined
his
head
dismissing
michaud
iv
at
that
time
when
russia
was
half
conquered
and
the
inhabitants
of
moscow
were
fleeing
to
the
distant
provinces
and
one
popular
militia
after
another
was
rising
to
the
defense
of
the
fatherland
we
who
were
not
living
at
that
time
involuntarily
imagine
that
all
russian
people
great
and
small
were
taken
up
only
with
sacrificing
themselves
saving
the
fatherland
or
weeping
over
its
loss
the
stories
and
descriptions
of
that
time
all
speak
without
exception
of
selfsacrifice
love
of
the
fatherland
despair
grief
and
the
heroism
of
the
russians
in
reality
it
was
not
like
that
it
seems
so
to
us
only
because
all
we
see
in
the
past
is
the
general
historical
interest
of
the
time
and
we
do
not
see
all
those
personal
human
interests
that
the
people
of
that
time
had
and
yet
in
reality
the
personal
interests
of
the
day
are
so
much
more
significant
than
the
general
interests
that
as
a
result
the
general
interests
are
never
felt
or
even
noticed
at
all
the
majority
of
the
people
of
that
time
paid
no
attention
to
the
general
course
of
things
but
were
guided
only
by
the
personal
interests
of
the
day
and
those
people
were
the
most
useful
figures
of
that
time
those
however
who
tried
to
understand
the
general
course
of
things
and
wanted
to
take
it
with
selfsacrifice
and
heroism
were
the
most
useless
members
of
society
they
saw
everything
inside
out
and
everything
they
did
to
be
useful
turned
out
to
be
useless
nonsense
like
pierres
and
mamonovs
regiments
which
looted
russian
villages
like
the
lint
that
young
ladies
plucked
and
that
never
got
to
the
wounded
and
so
on
even
those
who
were
fond
of
being
clever
and
expressing
their
feelings
when
discussing
the
present
situation
of
russia
involuntarily
gave
their
speeches
the
stamp
either
of
pretense
and
falseness
or
of
useless
condemnation
and
spite
against
the
people
accusing
them
of
something
no
one
could
be
guilty
of
in
historical
events
what
is
most
obvious
is
the
prohibition
against
eating
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
only
unconscious
activity
bears
fruit
and
a
man
who
plays
a
role
in
a
historical
event
never
understands
its
significance
if
he
attempts
to
understand
it
he
is
struck
with
fruitlessness
the
significance
of
the
event
that
was
then
taking
place
in
russia
was
the
less
conspicuous
the
closer
a
mans
participation
in
it
was
in
petersburg
and
in
provincial
towns
far
from
moscow
ladies
and
men
in
militia
uniform
wept
over
russia
and
the
capital
and
spoke
of
selfsacrifice
and
so
on
but
in
the
army
that
was
retreating
beyond
moscow
there
was
almost
no
talk
or
thought
of
moscow
and
looking
at
it
burning
no
one
swore
revenge
on
the
french
but
they
thought
of
the
next
pay
day
of
their
next
halt
of
matryoshka
the
sutler
and
the
like
nikolai
rostov
without
any
aim
of
selfsacrifice
but
by
chance
since
the
war
found
him
in
the
service
took
a
direct
and
prolonged
the
defense
of
the
fatherland
and
therefore
looked
without
despair
and
dark
conclusions
at
what
was
then
happening
in
russia
if
he
had
been
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
present
situation
in
russia
he
would
have
said
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
think
that
kutuzov
and
others
were
there
for
that
and
that
he
had
heard
that
regiments
were
being
replenished
and
that
it
must
mean
the
fighting
would
go
on
for
a
long
time
yet
and
that
in
the
present
circumstances
it
would
be
no
wonder
to
him
if
he
got
a
regiment
within
a
couple
of
years
looking
at
things
as
he
did
he
took
the
news
of
his
being
sent
to
voronezh
to
remount
the
division
not
only
with
no
regret
at
not
taking
the
coming
fight
but
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
which
he
did
not
conceal
and
which
his
comrades
understood
perfectly
well
several
days
before
the
battle
of
borodino
nikolai
received
money
papers
and
sending
his
hussars
on
ahead
drove
to
voronezh
by
post
chaise
only
someone
who
has
experienced
itthat
is
who
has
spent
several
months
on
end
in
an
atmosphere
of
active
dutycan
understand
the
pleasure
nikolai
experienced
when
he
got
out
of
the
area
over
which
the
troops
spread
their
foraging
operations
supply
trains
and
hospitals
when
instead
of
soldiers
carts
the
dirty
traces
of
a
camps
presence
he
saw
villages
with
peasant
men
and
women
landowners
houses
fields
with
grazing
cattle
posting
stations
with
sleeping
stationmasters
he
felt
such
joy
as
if
he
were
seeing
it
all
for
the
first
time
what
especially
surprised
and
gladdened
him
for
a
long
time
were
the
young
healthy
women
who
did
not
each
have
a
dozen
officers
dangling
after
them
and
who
were
glad
and
flattered
that
a
traveling
officer
joked
with
them
in
the
most
cheerful
state
of
mind
nikolai
arrived
at
night
at
a
hotel
in
voronezh
ordered
everything
that
he
had
long
been
deprived
of
in
the
army
and
the
next
day
cleanshaven
and
wearing
his
longunworn
fulldress
uniform
went
to
report
to
the
authorities
the
head
of
the
militia
was
a
civilian
general
an
old
man
who
clearly
enjoyed
his
military
title
and
rank
he
received
nikolai
gruffly
thinking
it
was
the
military
way
and
questioned
him
imposingly
as
if
he
had
the
right
to
do
so
approving
and
disapproving
as
if
he
were
discussing
the
general
course
of
things
nikolai
felt
so
cheerful
that
he
found
it
merely
amusing
from
the
head
of
the
militia
he
went
to
the
governor
the
governor
was
a
lively
little
fellow
very
gentle
and
simple
he
pointed
nikolai
to
the
stud
farms
where
he
might
get
horses
recommended
a
dealer
in
town
and
a
landowner
fifteen
miles
out
of
town
who
had
the
best
horses
and
promised
him
every
sort
of
assistance
are
you
the
son
of
count
ilya
andreevich
my
wife
was
great
friends
with
your
mother
we
receive
on
thursdays
todays
a
thursday
kindly
come
to
my
place
without
any
formalities
said
the
governor
dismissing
him
straight
from
the
governors
nikolai
took
relay
horses
and
putting
the
sergeant
major
in
with
him
galloped
off
to
the
landowners
stud
farm
fifteen
miles
away
everything
in
this
initial
period
of
his
stay
in
voronezh
was
cheerful
and
easy
and
as
happens
when
a
man
is
welldisposed
himself
everything
went
smoothly
and
swimmingly
the
landowner
nikolai
went
to
was
an
old
bachelor
a
cavalry
officer
a
horse
fancier
a
hunter
the
owner
of
a
carpet
room
of
centuryold
honey
vodka
old
hungarian
wine
and
superb
horses
after
a
couple
of
words
nikolai
bought
seventeen
stallions
for
six
thousand
choice
ones
as
he
said
to
make
a
display
of
his
remount
having
had
dinner
and
drunk
a
bit
too
much
hungarian
rostov
exchanged
kisses
with
the
landowner
with
whom
he
was
already
on
familiar
terms
and
galloped
back
over
the
abominable
road
in
the
merriest
spirits
constantly
urging
the
driver
on
so
as
to
be
back
in
time
for
the
governors
soir233e
changed
scented
his
head
doused
with
cold
water
nikolai
somewhat
late
but
armed
with
the
phrase
vaut
mieux
tard
que
jamais
arrived
at
the
governors
it
was
not
a
ball
and
no
mention
had
been
made
of
dancing
but
everyone
knew
that
katerina
petrovna
would
play
waltzes
and
233cossaises
on
the
clavichord
and
that
there
would
be
dancing
and
counting
on
that
everyone
gathered
as
for
a
ball
provincial
life
in
1812
was
exactly
the
same
as
ever
with
the
only
difference
that
things
were
more
lively
in
town
because
of
the
arrival
of
many
rich
families
from
moscow
and
that
as
in
everything
that
was
going
on
at
that
time
in
russia
some
special
boldness
was
noticeable
in
itdevilmaycare
harumscarumand
also
in
that
the
banal
conversation
necessary
among
people
which
formerly
was
about
the
weather
and
mutual
acquaintances
was
now
about
moscow
the
army
and
napoleon
the
society
gathered
at
the
governors
was
the
best
society
of
voronezh
there
were
a
great
many
ladies
there
were
several
of
nikolais
moscow
acquaintances
but
none
of
the
men
could
in
any
way
rival
the
bearer
of
the
st
george
the
remount
officer
of
the
hussars
who
was
at
the
same
time
the
goodnatured
and
wellbred
count
rostov
among
the
men
there
was
an
italian
prisoneran
officer
of
the
french
armyand
nikolai
felt
that
the
presence
of
this
prisoner
further
enhanced
his
significance
as
a
russian
hero
he
was
like
a
trophy
nikolai
felt
it
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
looked
at
the
italian
that
way
and
nikolai
treated
this
officer
kindly
with
dignity
and
restraint
as
soon
as
nikolai
entered
in
his
hussar
uniform
spreading
about
him
the
smell
of
scent
and
wine
and
said
himself
and
heard
said
to
him
several
times
the
words
vaut
mieux
tard
que
jamais
he
was
surrounded
all
eyes
turned
to
him
and
he
felt
at
once
that
he
had
stepped
into
the
position
of
the
universal
favorite
which
befitted
him
in
the
province
and
was
always
agreeable
but
now
after
prolonged
privation
made
him
drunk
with
pleasure
not
only
in
posting
stations
inns
and
the
landowners
carpet
room
were
the
servant
girls
flattered
by
his
attentions
but
here
at
the
governors
soir233e
there
was
as
it
seemed
to
nikolai
an
inexhaustible
number
of
young
ladies
and
pretty
girls
who
were
waiting
impatiently
for
him
to
pay
attention
to
them
ladies
and
girls
flirted
with
him
and
from
the
first
day
the
old
folk
began
bustling
about
to
get
this
dashing
scapegrace
of
a
hussar
married
and
settled
down
among
the
latter
was
the
governors
wife
herself
who
received
rostov
like
a
close
relation
called
him
nicolas
and
my
dear
katerina
petrovna
indeed
began
to
play
waltzes
and
233cossaises
and
dancing
began
in
which
nikolai
charmed
the
whole
provincial
society
still
more
with
his
adroitness
he
even
surprised
them
with
his
special
casual
way
of
dancing
nikolai
was
surprised
himself
at
his
way
of
dancing
that
evening
he
had
never
danced
that
way
in
moscow
and
even
would
have
considered
such
an
alltoocasual
way
of
dancing
improper
and
mauvais
genre
but
here
he
felt
the
need
to
astonish
them
all
with
something
extraordinary
something
which
they
would
take
as
ordinary
in
the
capital
but
as
yet
unknown
in
the
provinces
all
evening
nikolai
paid
most
attention
to
a
blueeyed
plump
and
sweetlooking
blonde
the
wife
of
one
of
the
provincial
officials
with
the
na239ve
conviction
of
young
men
making
merry
that
other
mens
wives
were
created
for
them
rostov
never
left
this
ladys
side
and
treated
her
husband
in
a
friendly
somewhat
conspiratorial
way
as
if
though
there
was
no
talk
of
it
they
knew
how
nicely
they
would
get
along
togetherthat
is
nikolai
and
this
husbands
wife
the
husband
however
did
not
seem
to
share
that
conviction
and
tried
to
sulk
with
rostov
but
nikolais
goodnatured
na239vet233
was
so
boundless
that
now
and
then
the
husband
involuntarily
yielded
to
his
merry
spirits
towards
the
end
of
the
evening
however
as
the
wifes
face
became
ever
more
flushed
and
animated
her
husbands
face
became
sadder
and
paler
as
if
they
had
one
portion
of
animation
between
them
and
as
it
increased
in
the
wife
it
diminished
in
the
husband
v
nikolai
with
a
smile
that
never
left
his
face
slightly
curved
in
an
armchair
sat
bending
closely
over
the
blonde
paying
her
mythological
compliments
briskly
shifting
the
position
of
his
legs
in
their
tight
riding
breeches
spreading
the
smell
of
scent
around
him
and
admiring
his
lady
and
himself
and
the
fine
shape
of
his
legs
in
their
tight
buckskins
nikolai
was
saying
to
the
blonde
that
there
was
a
certain
lady
there
in
voronezh
that
he
wanted
to
abduct
what
sort
of
lady
charming
divine
her
eyes
nikolai
looked
at
his
interlocutrice
are
blue
her
mouth
is
coral
the
whiteness
he
glanced
at
her
shoulders
of
her
figure
is
like
dianas
the
husband
came
over
to
them
and
sulkily
asked
his
wife
what
she
was
talking
about
ah
nikita
ivanych
said
nikolai
politely
getting
up
and
as
if
wishing
nikita
ivanych
to
share
in
the
joke
he
began
telling
him
too
about
his
wish
to
abduct
a
certain
blonde
lady
the
husband
smiled
sullenly
the
wife
gaily
the
governors
kindly
wife
came
up
to
them
with
a
disapproving
air
anna
ignatyevna
wants
to
see
you
nicolas
she
said
uttering
the
words
anna
ignatyevna
in
such
a
tone
that
it
became
clear
at
once
to
rostov
that
anna
ignatyevna
was
a
very
important
lady
come
nicolas
you
do
allow
me
to
call
you
that
oh
yes

about
you
from
her
niece

nikolai
her
niece

in
voronezh
with
her
aunt
oho

never
thought
of
it
enough
ma
tante
well
all
right
all
right
oh
what
a
one
you
are
the
governors
wife
led
him
to
a
tall
and
very
fat
old
woman
in
a
blue
toque
who
had
just
finished
her
game
of
cards
with
the
most
important
persons
in
town
this
was
mrs
malvintsev
princess
maryas
aunt
on
her
mothers
side
a
wealthy
childless
widow
who
lived
yearround
in
voronezh
she
was
standing
and
settling
up
for
the
game
when
rostov
approached
her
she
narrowed
her
eyes
sternly
and
imposingly
glanced
at
him
and
went
on
scolding
the
general
who
had
won
from
her
delighted
my
dear
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
kindly
call
on
me
after
talking
about
princess
marya
and
her
late
father
whom
mrs
malvintsev
evidently
did
not
like
and
asking
nikolai
what
he
knew
about
prince
andrei
who
evidently
was
also
not
in
her
good
graces
the
imposing
old
lady
let
him
go
repeating
her
invitation
to
visit
her
nikolai
promised
and
blushed
again
as
he
was
taking
leave
of
mrs
malvintsev
at
the
mention
of
princess
marya
rostov
experienced
a
feeling
of
bashfulness
even
fear
incomprehensible
to
himself
on
leaving
mrs
malvintsev
nikolai
wanted
to
return
to
the
dancing
but
the
governors
wife
placed
her
plump
little
hand
on
his
sleeve
and
saying
that
she
needed
to
talk
to
him
led
him
to
the
sitting
room
which
those
who
were
there
left
at
once
so
as
not
to
hinder
her
you
know
mon
cher
said
the
governors
wife
with
a
serious
expression
on
her
small
kindly
face
its
just
the
match
for
you
would
you
like
me
to
arrange
it
with
whom
ma
tante
asked
nikolai
with
the
princess
katerina
petrovna
says
lili
but
i
think
nothe
princess
would
you
like
me
to
im
sure
your
maman
will
thank
me
really
such
a
girl
so
lovely
and
shes
not
at
all
so
badlooking
not
at
all
nikolai
said
as
if
offended
as
befits
a
soldier
ma
tante
i
dont
invite
myself
anywhere
and
dont
refuse
anything
said
rostov
before
he
had
time
to
think
what
he
was
saying
remember
then
this
is
not
a
joke
of
course
not
yes
yes
said
the
governors
wife
as
if
talking
to
herself
and
heres
another
thing
mon
cher
entre
autres
vous
234tes
trop
assidu
aupr232s
de
lautre
la
blonde
the
husband
is
pitiful
really
ah
no
were
friends
nikolai
said
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
pastime
which
he
found
so
amusing
might
not
be
so
for
someone
else
but
what
a
stupid
thing
i
said
to
the
governors
wife
nikolai
suddenly
recalled
at
supper
shes
sure
to
start
matchmaking
and
sonya
and
on
taking
leave
of
the
governors
wife
when
she
smiling
told
him
once
more
well
so
remember
he
took
her
aside
the
thing
is
to
tell
you
the
truth
ma
tante
what
is
it
what
is
it
my
friend
lets
go
and
sit
down
there
nikolai
suddenly
felt
a
desire
and
a
need
to
tell
all
his
innermost
thoughts
such
as
he
would
not
have
told
to
his
mother
sister
or
friend
to
this
woman
who
was
almost
a
stranger
to
him
later
when
he
recalled
this
impulse
of
unprovoked
inexplicable
candor
which
however
had
very
important
consequences
for
him
it
seemed
to
nikolai
as
it
always
seems
to
people
that
it
had
been
just
a
stupid
whimsy
and
yet
this
impulse
of
candor
along
with
other
small
events
had
enormous
consequences
for
him
and
for
the
whole
family
heres
the
thing
ma
tante
maman
has
long
wanted
me
to
marry
a
rich
girl
but
the
very
thought
of
marrying
for
money
is
repugnant
to
me
oh
yes
i
understand
said
the
governors
wife
but
princess
bolkonsky
is
another
thing
first
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
like
her
very
much
shes
a
girl
after
my
heart
and
then
since
i
met
her
in
such
circumstances
so
strangely
it
has
often
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
fate
especially
if
you
consider
that
maman
has
long
been
thinking
of
it
but
i
never
happened
to
meet
her
before
it
just
happened
that
we
kept
not
meeting
and
at
the
time
when
natasha
was
engaged
to
her
brother
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
think
of
marrying
her
it
had
to
be
that
i
met
her
precisely
when
natashas
engagement
broke
up
well
and
then
it
allbut
heres
the
thing
ive
never
told
this
to
anyone
and
never
will
only
to
you
the
governors
wife
gratefully
pressed
his
elbow
you
know
sophie
my
cousin
i
love
her
ive
promised
to
marry
her
and
will
marry
herso
you
see
there
can
be
no
talk
of
it
nikolai
said
incoherently
and
blushing
mon
cher
mon
cher
how
can
you
reason
that
way
sophie
has
nothing
and
you
said
yourself
that
your
fathers
affairs
are
in
disorder
and
your
maman
it
will
kill
her
for
one
thing
then
sophie
if
shes
a
girl
with
a
heart
what
sort
of
life
will
it
be
for
her
the
mother
in
despair
affairs
in
disorderno
mon
cher
you
and
sophie
ought
to
understand
that
nikolai
was
silent
it
was
pleasant
for
him
to
hear
these
conclusions
all
the
same
ma
tante
it
cannot
be
he
said
with
a
sigh
after
a
brief
pause
and
would
the
princess
marry
me
and
then
too
shes
in
mourning
now
can
there
be
any
thought
of
it
youre
not
thinking
that
ill
marry
you
off
at
once

said
the
governors
wife
what
a
matchmaker
you
are

said
nikolai
kissing
her
plump
little
hand
vi
on
arriving
in
moscow
after
her
meeting
with
rostov
princess
marya
had
found
her
nephew
there
with
his
tutor
and
a
letter
from
prince
andrei
who
instructed
them
to
proceed
to
voronezh
to
their
aunt
mrs
malvintsev
the
cares
of
moving
worry
about
her
brother
organizing
life
in
a
new
home
new
faces
her

this
stifled
in
princess
maryas
soul
that
feeling
of
temptation
as
it
were
which
had
tormented
her
during
the
illness
and
after
the
death
of
her
father
and
especially
after
meeting
rostov
she
was
sad
now
after
a
month
spent
in
quiet
conditions
of
life
the
impression
of
the
loss
of
her
father
combined
in
her
soul
with
the
perishing
of
russia
made
itself
felt
in
her
more
and
more
strongly
she
was
anxious
the
thought
of
the
dangers
to
which
her
brotherthe
only
close
person
she
had
leftwas
exposed
tormented
her
ceaselessly
she
was
worried
about
the
upbringing
of
her
nephew
a
task
to
which
she
constantly
felt
herself
unequal
but
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
there
was
a
harmony
with
herself
coming
from
the
consciousness
that
she
had
suppressed
in
herself
the
personal
dreams
and
hopes
that
had
begun
to
arise
in
her
with
the
appearance
of
rostov
when
the
governors
wife
went
to
mrs
malvintsevs
the
day
after
her
soir233e
and
having
talked
over
her
plans
with
the
aunt
mentioning
that
though
under
the
circumstances
it
was
impossible
even
to
think
of
a
formal
engagement
still
the
young
people
could
be
brought
together
and
given
a
chance
to
know
each
other
and
when
having
obtained
the
aunts
approval
the
governors
wife
spoke
of
rostov
in
princess
maryas
presence
praising
him
and
telling
how
he
had
blushed
at
the
mention
of
the
princessprincess
marya
experienced
not
a
joyful
but
a
painful
feeling
her
inner
harmony
no
longer
existed
and
again
there
arose
desires
doubts
reproaches
and
hopes
in
the
two
days
that
passed
between
the
time
of
this
announcement
and
rostovs
visit
princess
marya
never
stopped
thinking
of
how
she
ought
to
behave
in
relation
to
him
first
she
decided
that
she
would
not
come
out
to
the
drawing
room
when
he
called
on
her
aunt
that
it
was
improper
for
her
in
deep
mourning
to
receive
guests
then
she
thought
that
that
would
be
rude
after
what
he
had
done
for
her
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
aunt
and
the
governors
wife
had
some
sort
of
designs
on
her
and
rostov
their
glances
and
words
occasionally
seemed
to
confirm
that
conjecture
then
she
said
to
herself
that
only
she
in
her
depravity
could
think
that
of
them
they
could
not
help
realizing
that
in
her
position
when
she
was
still
in
deep
mourning
such
matchmaking
would
be
insulting
both
to
her
and
to
her
fathers
memory
supposing
that
she
would
come
out
to
him
princess
marya
thought
up
the
words
he
would
say
to
her
and
she
to
him
and
these
words
seemed
to
her
now
undeservedly
cold
now
too
fraught
with
significance
most
of
all
she
feared
the
embarrassment
which
she
felt
was
bound
to
overcome
her
and
betray
her
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
but
on
sunday
after
the
liturgy
when
a
footman
came
to
the
drawing
room
and
announced
that
count
rostov
was
there
the
princess
showed
no
embarrassment
only
a
slight
flush
came
to
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
lit
up
with
a
new
luminous
brightness
have
you
seen
him
aunt
princess
marya
asked
in
a
calm
voice
not
knowing
herself
how
she
could
be
so
outwardly
calm
and
natural
when
rostov
entered
the
room
the
princess
lowered
her
head
for
a
moment
as
if
giving
her
guest
time
to
greet
her
aunt
and
then
just
as
nikolai
turned
to
her
she
raised
her
head
and
her
shining
eyes
met
his
gaze
in
a
movement
full
of
dignity
and
grace
she
rose
with
a
joyful
smile
gave
him
her
slender
delicate
hand
and
began
to
speak
in
a
voice
in
which
for
the
first
time
new
throaty
feminine
notes
sounded
mlle
bourienne
who
was
in
the
drawing
room
looked
at
princess
marya
with
bewildered
astonishment
a
skillful
coquette
herself
she
could
not
have
maneuvered
better
on
meeting
a
man
she
wanted
to
please
either
black
is
quite
becoming
to
her
or
she
has
really
grown
quite
pretty
and
i
havent
noticed
it
and
above
allthat
tact
and
grace
thought
mlle
bourienne
if
princess
marya
had
been
able
to
reflect
at
that
moment
she
would
have
been
more
astonished
than
mlle
bourienne
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
from
the
moment
she
saw
that
dear
beloved
face
some
new
force
of
life
had
taken
hold
of
her
and
made
her
speak
and
act
a
her
own
will
her
face
from
the
time
rostov
entered
was
suddenly
transformed
as
the
complex
skillful
artwork
on
the
sides
of
a
carved
and
painted
lantern
which
had
seemed
crude
dark
and
meaningless
before
suddenly
emerges
with
unexpected
striking
beauty
when
the
light
is
lit
inside
so
was
princess
maryas
face
suddenly
transformed
for
the
first
time
all
that
pure
spiritual
inner
work
which
she
had
so
far
lived
by
emerged
all
her
inner
work
of
discontent
with
herself
her
suffering
her
yearning
for
the
good
obedience
love
selfsacrificeall
this
now
shone
in
those
luminous
eyes
in
her
fine
smile
in
every
feature
of
her
tender
face
rostov
saw
it
all
as
clearly
as
if
he
knew
her
whole
life
he
sensed
that
the
being
before
him
was
quite
different
and
better
than
all
those
he
had
met
till
then
and
above
all
better
than
himself
the
conversation
was
most
simple
and
insignificant
they
talked
of
the
war
involuntarily
exaggerating
like
everyone
else
their
grief
at
these
events
talked
of
their
last
meeting
with
nikolai
trying
to
turn
the
conversation
to
another
subject
talked
of
the
governors
kindly
wife
of
nikolais
and
princess
maryas
relatives
princess
marya
did
not
speak
of
her
brother
turning
the
conversation
to
another
subject
as
soon
as
her
aunt
mentioned
prince
andrei
it
was
clear
that
she
could
speak
artificially
about
the
misfortunes
of
russia
but
her
brother
was
a
subject
too
close
to
her
heart
and
she
would
not
and
could
not
speak
lightly
of
him
nikolai
noticed
that
as
he
generally
noticed
with
a
keenness
of
observation
unusual
for
him
all
the
nuances
of
princess
maryas
character
which
only
confirmed
his
conviction
that
she
was
an
utterly
special
and
extraordinary
being
nikolai
just
like
princess
marya
blushed
and
became
embarrassed
when
someone
talked
to
him
about
the
princess
and
even
when
he
thought
about
her
but
in
her
presence
he
felt
perfectly
free
and
said
not
at
all
what
he
had
prepared
but
what
instantly
and
always
appropriately
came
to
his
head
during
nikolais
brief
visit
as
usual
in
a
house
where
there
are
children
he
resorted
to
prince
andreis
little
son
when
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
stroking
his
head
and
asking
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
hussar
he
took
the
boy
in
his
arms
began
tossing
him
merrily
and
turned
to
look
at
princess
marya
her
tender
happy
and
timid
gaze
followed
the
boy
she
loved
in
the
arms
of
the
man
she
loved
nikolai
noticed
this
gaze
and
as
if
understanding
its
meaning
blushed
with
pleasure
and
began
to
kiss
the
boy
merrily
and
goodnaturedly
princess
marya
did
not
go
out
because
she
was
in
mourning
and
nikolai
did
not
consider
it
proper
to
visit
them
but
the
governors
wife
still
went
on
with
her
matchmaking
business
and
having
told
nikolai
the
flattering
things
princess
marya
had
said
about
him
and
vice
versa
insisted
that
rostov
should
declare
himself
to
princess
marya
for
that
talk
she
arranged
a
meeting
between
the
young
people
at
the
bishops
before
the
liturgy
though
rostov
told
the
governors
wife
that
he
would
not
make
any
sort
of
declaration
to
princess
marya
he
did
promise
to
come
just
as
in
tilsit
rostov
had
not
allowed
himself
to
doubt
that
what
everyone
recognized
as
good
was
indeed
good
so
also
now
after
a
brief
but
sincere
struggle
between
his
effort
to
arrange
his
life
according
to
his
own
reason
and
a
humble
submission
to
circumstances
he
chose
the
latter
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
power
which
he
felt
was
irresistibly
drawing
him
somewhere
he
knew
that
having
given
sonya
his
promise
to
speak
out
his
feelings
to
princess
marya
would
be
what
he
called
base
and
he
knew
that
he
would
never
do
anything
base
but
he
also
knew
or
did
not
know
but
felt
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
that
in
yielding
now
to
the
power
of
the
circumstances
and
the
people
who
were
guiding
him
he
was
not
only
doing
nothing
bad
but
was
doing
something
very
very
important
more
important
than
anything
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
after
his
meeting
with
princess
marya
the
form
of
his
life
outwardly
remained
the
same
but
all
his
former
pleasures
lost
their
charm
for
him
and
he
often
thought
of
princess
marya
but
he
never
thought
of
her
as
he
thought
without
exception
of
all
the
young
ladies
he
met
in
society
nor
as
he
had
long
thought
and
at
one
time
with
rapture
about
sonya
like
almost
every
honorable
young
man
he
had
thought
of
all
young
ladies
as
future
wives
applying
to
them
in
his
imagination
all
the
conditions
of
married
life
a
white
dressing
gown
a
wife
at
the
samovar
the
wifes
carriage
children
maman
and
papa
his
relations
with
her
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
he
had
enjoyed
these
pictures
of
the
future
but
when
he
thought
of
princess
marya
with
whom
they
were
matchmaking
him
he
never
could
imagine
anything
of
their
future
married
life
even
when
he
tried
everything
came
out
incoherent
and
false
it
only
made
him
feel
eerie
vii
the
dreadful
news
of
the
battle
of
borodino
of
our
losses
in
dead
and
wounded
and
the
still
more
dreadful
news
about
the
loss
of
moscow
were
received
in
voronezh
in
the
middle
of
september
princess
marya
learning
of
her
brothers
wound
only
from
the
newspapers
and
having
no
definite
news
of
him
was
getting
ready
to
go
in
search
of
prince
andrei
as
nikolai
heard
he
had
not
seen
her
himself
on
receiving
the
news
of
the
battle
of
borodino
and
the
abandoning
of
moscow
rostov
did
not
experience
despair
anger
or
vengefulness
and
any
similar
feeling
but
for
him
everything
in
voronezh
suddenly
became
dull
and
vexing
everything
was
somehow
shameful
and
awkward
all
the
conversations
he
heard
seemed
artificial
to
him
he
did
not
know
how
to
judge
it
all
and
he
felt
that
only
in
the
regiment
would
everything
become
clear
to
him
again
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
finish
buying
the
horses
and
often
flew
into
a
temper
unfairly
with
his
servant
and
the
sergeant
major
a
few
days
before
rostovs
departure
a
prayer
service
was
offered
on
the
occasion
of
the
victory
won
by
the
russian
troops
and
nikolai
went
to
the
liturgy
he
placed
himself
a
little
behind
the
governor
and
with
official
staidness
thinking
of
the
most
various
subjects
stood
through
the
service
when
the
prayers
were
over
the
governors
wife
beckoned
him
to
her
did
you
see
the
princess
she
said
nodding
towards
a
lady
in
black
standing
behind
the
choir
nikolai
at
once
recognized
princess
marya
not
so
much
by
her
profile
which
could
be
seen
under
her
hat
as
by
that
feeling
of
carefulness
fear
and
pity
that
at
once
came
over
him
princess
marya
obviously
immersed
in
her
own
thoughts
made
a
last
sign
of
the
cross
before
leaving
the
church
nikolai
looked
at
her
face
with
astonishment
it
was
the
same
face
he
had
seen
before
in
it
was
the
same
general
expression
of
fine
inner
spiritual
work
but
now
it
was
lit
completely
differently
it
bore
a
touching
expression
of
sorrow
entreaty
and
hope
as
had
happened
with
nikolai
before
in
her
presence
he
went
up
to
her
without
waiting
for
the
governors
wife
to
advise
him
to
go
to
her
without
asking
himself
whether
or
not
it
would
be
good
or
proper
for
him
to
address
her
there
in
church
and
told
her
that
he
had
heard
about
her
grief
and
sympathized
with
her
with
all
his
soul
as
soon
as
she
heard
his
voice
a
bright
light
suddenly
shone
in
her
face
lighting
up
both
her
sorrow
and
her
joy
there
is
one
thing
i
wanted
to
tell
you
princess
said
rostov
it
is
that
if
prince
andrei
nikolaevich
was
no
longer
alive
him
being
the
commander
of
a
regiment
it
would
have
been
announced
at
once
in
the
newspapers
the
princess
was
looking
at
him
not
understanding
his
words
but
rejoicing
at
the
expression
of
compassionate
suffering
in
his
face
and
i
know
so
many
examples
when
a
shrapnel
wound
the
newspaper
had
said
it
was
a
shell
is
either
fatal
at
once
or
on
the
contrary
very
light
said
nikolai
you
must
hope
for
the
best
and
im
sure
princess
marya
interrupted
him
oh
that
would
be
so
ter
she
began
and
breaking
off
from
emotion
she
inclined
her
head
gracefully
as
she
did
everything
in
his
presence
and
glancing
at
him
with
gratitude
followed
after
her
aunt
in
the
evening
of
that
day
nikolai
did
not
go
out
visiting
anywhere
but
stayed
home
to
finish
some
accounts
with
the
horse
dealers
when
he
finished
his
business
it
was
too
late
to
go
anywhere
but
still
too
early
to
go
to
bed
and
for
a
long
time
nikolai
paced
up
and
down
the
room
alone
thinking
over
his
life
which
rarely
happened
with
him
princess
marya
had
produced
a
pleasant
impression
on
him
near
smolensk
that
he
had
met
her
then
in
such
particular
conditions
and
that
it
was
precisely
her
that
his
mother
had
pointed
to
at
one
time
as
a
wealthy
match
for
him
had
made
him
pay
special
attention
to
her
in
voronezh
during
the
time
of
his
visit
the
impression
was
not
only
pleasant
but
strong
nikolai
was
struck
by
that
particular
moral
beauty
which
he
noticed
in
her
this
time
however
he
was
getting
ready
to
leave
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
regret
that
in
leaving
voronezh
he
was
losing
the
chance
of
seeing
the
princess
but
this
last
meeting
with
princess
marya
in
church
nikolai
felt
it
had
lodged
more
deeply
in
his
heart
than
he
expected
and
more
deeply
than
he
wished
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
that
pale
fine
sorrowful
face
that
luminous
gaze
those
quiet
graceful
movements
and
above
all
that
deep
and
tender
sorrow
which
showed
in
all
her
features
stirred
him
and
called
for
his
sympathy
rostov
could
not
bear
to
see
an
expression
of
higher
spiritual
life
in
men
that
was
why
he
did
not
like
prince
andrei
he
referred
to
it
contemptuously
as
philosophy
dreaminess
but
in
princess
marya
it
was
precisely
in
that
sorrow
which
revealed
the
whole
depth
of
a
spiritual
world
foreign
to
him
that
nikolai
felt
an
irresistible
attraction
she
must
be
a
wonderful
girl
precisely
an
angel
he
said
to
himself
why
am
i
not
free
why
did
i
rush
things
with
sonya
and
involuntarily
he
pictured
to
himself
a
comparison
between
the
two
the
poorness
of
the
one
and
the
richness
of
the
other
in
those
spiritual
gifts
which
nikolai
did
not
have
and
which
he
therefore
valued
so
highly
he
tried
to
picture
how
it
would
be
if
he
were
free
how
would
he
propose
to
her
and
how
would
she
become
his
wife
no
he
could
not
picture
it
to
himself
it
made
him
feel
eerie
and
no
clear
images
came
to
him
with
sonya
he
had
already
made
up
a
future
picture
and
it
was
all
simple
and
clear
precisely
because
it
was
all
invented
and
he
knew
everything
there
was
in
sonya
but
with
princess
marya
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
picture
a
future
life
because
he
did
not
understand
her
but
only
loved
her
dreams
about
sonya
had
something
gay
and
toylike
about
them
but
to
think
about
princess
marya
was
always
difficult
and
a
little
frightening
how
she
prayed
he
remembered
you
could
see
that
her
whole
soul
was
in
the
prayer
yes
thats
the
kind
of
prayer
that
moves
mountains
and
im
sure
her
prayer
will
be
answered
why

i
pray
for
what
i
want
he
wondered
what
do
i
want
freedom
release
from
sonya
what
she
said
was
true
he
remembered
the
words
of
the
governors
wife
there
will
be
nothing
but
unhappiness
if
i
marry
her
a
tangle
mamans
griefour

and

dont
love
her
no
i
dont
love
her
as
i
should
my
god
lead
me
out
of
this
terrible
hopeless
situation
he
suddenly
began
to
pray
yes
prayer
can
move
mountains
but
one
must
believe
and
not
pray
the
way
natasha
and
i
did
as
children
that
snow
turn
into
sugar
and
then
run
outside
to
see
if
it
did
turn
into
sugar
no
im
not
praying
about
trifles
now
he
said
putting
his
pipe
into
a
corner
crossing
his
arms
and
standing
before
the
icon
and
moved
to
tenderness
by
his
memory
of
princess
marya
he
began
to
pray
as
he
had
not
prayed
for
a
long
time
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
throat
when
lavrushka
came
in
with
some
papers
fool
why
do
you
barge
in
unasked
said
nikolai
quickly
changing
his
position
from
the
governor
lavrushka
said
in
a
sleepy
voice
a
messager
came
theres
mail
for
you
well
all
right
thanks
and
off
with
you
nikolai
took
the
two
letters
one
was
from
his
mother
the
other
from
sonya
he
recognized
them
by
the
handwriting
and
opened
sonyas
letter
first
he
had
read
only
a
few
lines
when
his
face
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
widened
fearfully
and
joyfully
no
it
cant
be
he
said
aloud
unable
to
sit
still
he
began
pacing
the
room
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
reading
it
he
glanced
through
it
then
read
it
once
twice
and
hunching
his
shoulders
and
spreading
his
arms
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
gaping
mouth
and
fixed
eyes
the
thing
he
had
just
prayed
for
with
the
certainty
that
god
would
grant
his
prayer
had
been
granted
but
nikolai
was
astonished
by
it
as
if
it
was
something
extraordinary
and
as
if
he
had
never
expected
it
and
as
if
the
fact
that
it
had
happened
so
quickly
proved
that
it
came
not
from
god
whom
he
had
asked
but
from
ordinary
coincidence
that
seemingly
indissoluble
knot
which
had
bound
rostovs
freedom
was
dissolved
by
this
unexpected
as
it
seemed
to
nikolai
and
quite
unprovoked
letter
from
sonya
she
wrote
that
the
latest
unfortunate
circumstances
the
loss
of
almost
all
of
the
rostovs
moscow
property
the
countesss
oftrepeated
wishes
that
nikolai
should
marry
princess
bolkonsky
and
his
recent
silence
and
coldnessall
this
together
had
made
her
resolve
to
renounce
his
promise
and
give
him
full
freedom
it
is
too
painful
for
me
to
think
that
i
could
be
the
cause
of
grief
or
discord
in
the
family
of
my
benefactors
she
wrote
and
my
love
has
no
other
aim
than
the
happiness
of
those
i
love
and
so
i
beg
you
nicolas
to
consider
yourself
free
and
to
know
that
despite
all
no
one
can
love
you
more
thanyour
sonya
both
letters
came
from
the
trinity
monastery
the
other
letter
was
from
the
countess
this
letter
described
the
last
days
in
moscow
the
departure
the
fire
and
the
loss
of
all
their
property
among
other
things
the
countess
wrote
that
prince
andrei
was
traveling
with
them
among
the
wounded
his
condition
was
very
grave
but
the
doctor
now
said
there
was
greater
hope
sonya
and
natasha
were
taking
care
of
him
as
nurses
the
next
day
nikolai
took
this
letter
and
went
to
see
princess
marya
neither
nikolai
nor
princess
marya
said
a
word
about
what
the
words
natasha
is
taking
care
of
him
might
mean
but
owing
to
this
letter
nikolai
and
the
princess
were
suddenly
brought
together
in
almost
familial
relations
the
next
day
nikolai
saw
princess
marya
off
to
yaroslavl
and
a
few
days
later
left
himself
for
the
regiment
viii
sonyas
letter
to
nikolai
which
was
the
realization
of
his
prayer
had
been
written
from
the
trinity
monastery
here
is
how
it
came
about
the
old
countess
was
more
and
more
taken
up
with
the
idea
of
marrying
nikolai
to
a
rich
bride
she
knew
that
sonya
was
the
chief
obstacle
to
that
and
sonyas
life
recently
especially
after
nikolais
letter
describing
his
meeting
with
princess
marya
in
bogucharovo
was
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
in
the
countesss
house
the
countess
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
make
an
insulting
or
cruel
hint
to
sonya
but
a
few
days
before
leaving
moscow
moved
and
troubled
by
all
that
was
going
on
the
countess
having
sent
for
sonya
addressed
her
in
tears
instead
of
with
reproaches
and
demands
begging
her
to
pay
back
all
that
had
been
done
for
her
by
sacrificing
herself
and
breaking
her
bond
with
nikolai
i
wont
be
at
peace
as
long
as
you
havent
given
me
that
promise
sonya
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
answered
through
her
sobs
that
she
would
do
everything
that
she
was
ready
for
everything
but
promised
nothing
directly
and
in
her
soul
could
not
resolve
to
do
what
was
demanded
of
her
she
was
to
sacrifice
herself
for
the
happiness
of
the
family
that
had
nourished
and
raised
her
to
sacrifice
herself
for
others
was
sonyas
habit
her
position
in
the
house
was
such
that
it
was
only
on
the
path
of
sacrifice
that
she
could
show
her
worth
and
she
was
accustomed
to
sacrificing
herself
and
loved
it
but
formerly
in
all
her
acts
of
selfsacrifice
she
had
been
joyfully
aware
that
in
sacrificing
herself
she
thereby
raised
her
value
in
her
own
and
other
peoples
eyes
and
became
more
worthy
of
nicolas
whom
she
loved
more
than
anything
in
her
life
but
now
her
sacrifice
was
to
consist
in
renouncing
that
which
for
her
made
up
the
whole
reward
for
her
sacrifice
the
whole
meaning
of
her
life
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
bitter
towards
the
people
who
had
been
her
benefactors
only
so
as
to
torment
her
the
more
she
felt
envy
of
natasha
who
had
never
experienced
anything
like
that
who
had
never
needed
to
sacrifice
herself
but
made
others
sacrifice
themselves
for
her
and
was
loved
even
so
and
for
the
first
time
sonya
felt
her
quiet
pure
love
for
nicolas
suddenly
begin
to
grow
into
a
passionate
feeling
which
stood
above
the
rules
and
virtue
and
religion
and
under
the
influence
of
that
feeling
sonya
having
been
taught
by
her
life
of
dependence
to
be
secretive
involuntarily
answered
the
countess
in
general
indefinite
terms
avoided
talking
further
with
her
and
decided
to
wait
for
her
meeting
with
nikolai
not
in
order
to
free
him
at
that
meeting
but
on
the
contrary
to
bind
him
to
her
forever
the
bustle
and
horror
of
the
rostovs
last
days
in
moscow
stifled
in
sonya
the
gloomy
thoughts
that
oppressed
her
she
was
glad
to
find
salvation
from
them
in
practical
activity
but
when
she
learned
of
prince
andreis
presence
in
their
house
despite
all
the
sincere
pity
she
felt
for
him
and
for
natasha
the
joyful
and
superstitious
feeling
came
over
her
that
god
did
not
want
her
to
be
separated
from
nicolas
she
knew
that
natasha
loved
only
prince
andrei
and
had
never
ceased
loving
him
she
knew
that
now
being
brought
together
in
such
terrible
conditions
they
would
love
each
other
again
and
that
then
because
of
the
family
relations
between
them
nikolai
would
be
unable
to
marry
princess
marya
despite
all
the
horror
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
last
days
and
during
the
first
days
of
the
journey
this
feeling
this
consciousness
of
providence
interfering
in
her
personal
affairs
made
sonya
happy
in
the
trinity
monastery
the
rostovs
made
their
first
daylong
halt
in
their
journey
in
the
monastery
hostel
the
rostovs
were
given
three
big
rooms
one
of
which
was
occupied
by
prince
andrei
the
wounded
man
was
much
better
that
day
natasha
sat
with
him
in
the
next
room
sat
the
count
and
countess
talking
respectfully
with
the
superior
who
came
to
see
his
longstanding
acquaintances
and
donors
sonya
sat
with
them
and
she
was
tormented
by
curiosity
as
to
what
prince
andrei
and
natasha
were
talking
about
she
listened
to
the
sound
of
their
voices
through
the
door
the
door
to
prince
andreis
room
opened
natasha
came
out
with
an
agitated
face
and
not
noticing
the
monk
who
rose
to
meet
her
and
took
hold
of
the
wide
sleeve
on
his
right
arm
went
to
sonya
and
took
her
by
the
hand
natasha
whats
the
matter
with
you
come
here
said
the
countess
natasha
went
to
receive
the
blessing
and
the
superior
advised
her
to
turn
for
help
to
god
and
to
st
sergius
immediately
after
the
superior
left
natasha
took
her
friend
by
the
hand
and
went
with
her
to
the
empty
room
sonya
hes
going
to
live
yes
she
said
sonya
how
happy
i
am
and
how
unhappy
sonya
darlingits
all
like
before
if
only
he
lives
he
cantbecause
because
and
natasha
burst
into
tears
so
i
knew
it
thank
god
said
sonya
he
will
live
sonya
was
no
less
agitated
than
her
friendboth
by
her
fear
and
grief
and
by
her
own
personal
thoughts
which
she
did
not
tell
to
anyone
sobbing
she
kissed
and
comforted
natasha
if
only
he
lives
she
thought
having
wept
talked
and
wiped
their
tears
the
two
friends
went
up
to
prince
andreis
door
natasha
cautiously
opening
the
door
peeked
into
the
room
sonya
stood
next
to
her
by
the
halfopen
door
prince
andrei
lay
propped
high
on
three
pillows
his
pale
face
was
calm
his
eyes
closed
and
they
could
see
that
he
was
breathing
evenly
ah
natasha
sonya
suddenly
almost
cried
out
seizing
her
cousins
arm
and
stepping
back
from
the
door
what
what
is
it
asked
natasha
its
that
its
that
sonya
said
with
a
pale
face
and
trembling
lips
natasha
quietly
closed
the
door
and
stepped
to
the
window
with
sonya
still
not
understanding
what
was
being
said
to
her
do
you
remember
sonya
said
with
a
frightened
and
solemn
face
do
you
remember
when
i
looked
into
the
mirror
for
youin
otradnoe
at
christmasdo
you
remember
what
i
saw
yes
yes
said
natasha
opening
her
eyes
wide
vaguely
recalling
that
sonya
had
said
something
then
about
seeing
prince
andrei
lying
down
do
you
remember
sonya
went
on
i
saw
it
then
and
told
everybody
you
and
dunyasha
i
saw
him
lying
on
a
bed
she
said
making
a
gesture
with
her
raised
finger
at
each
detail
and
his
eyes
were
closed
and
he
was
covered
precisely
with
a
pink
quilt
and
his
hands
were
folded
sonya
said
becoming
convinced
as
she
described
the
details
she
had
just
seen
that
she
had
seen
those
same
details
then
then
she
had
seen
nothing
but
had
told
that
she
saw
whatever
came
into
her
head
but
what
she
had
invented
then
seemed
to
her
as
real
as
any
other
memory
what
she
had
said
then
that
he
had
glanced
at
her
and
smiled
and
was
covered
with
something
red
she
remembered
but
she
was
also
firmly
convinced
that
then
too
she
had
said
and
seen
that
he
was
covered
with
pink
precisely
a
pink
quilt
and
that
his
eyes
were
closed
yes
yes
precisely
pink
said
natasha
who
also
now
seemed
to
remember
the
mention
of
pink
and
in
this
she
saw
the
chief
extraordinariness
and
mysteriousness
of
the
prediction
but
what
does
it
mean
natasha
asked
thoughtfully
ah
i
dont
know
its
all
so
extraordinary
said
sonya
clutching
her
head
a
few
minutes
later
prince
andrei
rang
and
natasha
went
to
his
room
and
sonya
feeling
an
agitation
and
a
tenderness
she
had
rarely
felt
stayed
by
the
window
thinking
over
all
the
extraordinariness
of
what
had
happened
on
that
day
there
was
a
chance
to
send
letters
to
the
army
and
the
countess
was
writing
a
letter
to
her
son
sonya
said
the
countess
raising
her
head
from
the
letter
as
her
niece
walked
past
her
sonya
why
dont
you
write
to
nikolenka
the
countess
said
in
a
soft
quavering
voice
and
in
the
gaze
of
her
weary
eyes
looking
through
her
spectacles
sonya
read
all
that
the
countess
implied
by
these
words
that
gaze
expressed
entreaty
and
fear
of
refusal
and
shame
at
having
to
ask
and
a
readiness
for
implacable
hatred
in
case
of
refusal
sonya
went
up
to
the
countess
and
kneeling
kissed
her
hand
i
will
maman
she
said
sonya
was
softened
agitated
and
moved
by
all
that
had
happened
that
day
especially
by
the
mysterious
fulfillment
she
had
just
seen
of
her
divination
now
when
she
knew
that
because
of
the
renewal
of
natashas
relations
with
prince
andrei
nikolai
could
not
marry
princess
marya
she
felt
with
joy
the
return
of
that
mood
of
selfsacrifice
in
which
she
loved
and
was
accustomed
to
live
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
joyful
awareness
of
performing
a
magnanimous
act
she
wrote
interrupted
several
times
by
the
tears
that
clouded
her
velvety
black
eyes
that
touching
letter
the
reception
of
which
so
struck
nikolai
ix
in
the
guardhouse
where
pierre
was
taken
the
officers
and
soldiers
who
had
arrested
him
treated
him
hostilely
but
at
the
same
time
respectfully
in
their
attitude
towards
him
doubt
could
still
be
felt
of
who
he
was
perhaps
a
very
important
person
and
hostility
because
of
the
stillfresh
personal
struggle
with
him
but
when
another
shift
came
the
next
morning
pierre
felt
that
for
these
new
guardsboth
officers
and
soldiershe
did
not
have
the
same
meaning
he
had
had
for
those
who
arrested
him
and
indeed
in
this
large
fat
man
in
a
peasant
kaftan
the
next
days
guards
no
longer
saw
the
living
man
who
had
fought
so
desperately
with
a
looter
and
the
convoy
soldiers
and
had
spoken
the
solemn
phrase
about
saving
a
child
but
saw
only
the
seventeenth
arrested
russian
kept
there
for
some
reason
on
orders
from
the
high
command
if
there
was
anything
special
in
pierre
it
was
only
his
untimid
concentratedly
thoughtful
air
and
the
french
which
surprisingly
for
the
french
he
spoke
very
well
despite
which
on
that
same
day
pierre
was
put
together
with
the
other
arrested
suspects
because
the
separate
room
he
had
occupied
was
needed
for
an
officer
all
the
russians
held
together
with
pierre
were
people
of
the
lowest
estate
and
all
of
them
recognizing
pierre
as
a
gentleman
shunned
him
the
more
so
as
he
spoke
french
pierre
listened
with
sadness
to
their
mockery
of
him
that
evening
pierre
learned
that
all
these
prisoners
and
probably
he
among
them
were
to
be
tried
for
arson
on
the
third
day
pierre
was
taken
with
the
others
to
some
house
where
a
french
general
with
white
mustaches
sat
with
two
colonels
and
other
frenchmen
with
armbands
with
that
precision
and
definiteness
which
is
supposedly
above
human
weakness
and
with
which
the
accused
are
usually
treated
pierre
like
the
others
was
questioned
about
who
he
was
where
he
had
been
with
what
purpose
and
so
on
these
questions
leaving
aside
the
essence
of
lifes
business
and
excluding
any
possibility
of
discovering
that
essence
like
all
questions
asked
at
trials
were
aimed
only
at
furnishing
that
channel
down
which
the
judges
wished
the
answers
of
the
accused
to
flow
leading
him
to
the
desired
goal
that
is
incrimination
as
soon
as
he
began
to
say
something
that
did
not
conform
to
the
purpose
of
incrimination
the
channel
was
removed
and
the
water
could
flow
wherever
it
liked
besides
that
pierre
experienced
the
same
thing
that
an
accused
man
experiences
in
any
court
perplexity
as
to
why
all
these
questions
were
being
asked
him
he
had
the
feeling
that
this
trick
of
furnishing
him
with
a
channel
was
being
used
only
out
of
indulgence
or
courtesy
as
it
were
he
knew
that
he
was
in
the
power
of
these
people
that
it
was
only
power
that
had
brought
him
there
that
only
power
gave
them
the
right
to
demand
answers
to
their
questions
and
that
the
only
purpose
of
this
gathering
was
to
incriminate
him
and
therefore
since
there
was
power
and
the
wish
to
incriminate
there
was
no
need
for
the
trickery
of
questions
and
a
trial
it
was
obvious
that
all
answers
should
lead
to
finding
him
guilty
to
the
question
of
what
he
was
doing
when
they
arrested
him
pierre
answered
somewhat
tragically
that
he
was
carrying
a
child
quil
avait
sauv233
des
flammes
to
her
parents
why
had
he
fought
with
the
looter
pierre
answered
that
he
was
defending
a
woman
that
to
defend
an
offended
woman
was
the
duty
of
every
man
thathe
was
stopped
that
did
not
suit
the
case
why
was
he
in
the
yard
of
the
burning
house
where
witnesses
had
seen
him
he
answered
that
he
had
gone
out
to
see
what
was
happening
in
moscow
he
was
stopped
again
he
had
not
been
asked
where
he
was
going
but
why
he
was
near
the
fire
who
was
he
they
repeated
to
him
their
first
question
which
he
had
told
them
he
did
not
want
to
answer
again
he
said
that
he
could
not
tell
them
write
that
down
its
bad
very
bad
the
general
with
the
white
mustaches
and
flushed
ruddy
face
said
sternly
to
him
on
the
fourth
day
fires
broke
out
on
the
zubovsky
rampart
pierre
and
thirteen
others
were
led
to
the
krymsky
ford
to
the
carriage
shed
of
a
merchants
house
going
down
the
streets
pierre
choked
from
the
smoke
which
seemed
to
hang
over
the
whole
city
fires
could
be
seen
on
all
sides
at
that
time
pierre
still
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
the
burning
of
moscow
and
looked
at
these
fires
with
horror
pierre
spent
four
more
days
in
the
carriage
shed
of
the
house
near
the
krymsky
ford
and
in
the
course
of
those
days
he
learned
from
the
conversation
of
the
french
soldiers
that
all
those
held
there
were
awaiting
the
marshals
decision
any
day
what
marshal
pierre
could
not
find
out
from
the
soldiers
apparently
for
the
soldiers
a
marshal
was
a
supreme
and
somewhat
mysterious
link
in
the
chain
of
power
those
first
days
until
the
eighth
of
septemberthe
day
when
the
prisoners
were
taken
for
a
second
interrogationwere
the
hardest
for
pierre
x
on
the
eighth
of
september
an
officer
came
into
the
prisoners
shed
a
very
important
one
judging
by
the
respect
with
which
the
guards
addressed
him
this
officer
probably
from
the
staff
with
a
list
in
his
hands
made
a
roll
call
of
all
the
russians
referring
to
pierre
as
celui
qui
navoue
pas
son
nom
and
looking
indifferently
and
lazily
over
all
the
prisoners
he
ordered
the
officer
of
the
guards
to
get
them
decently
dressed
and
tidied
up
before
bringing
them
to
the
marshal
an
hour
later
a
company
of
soldiers
arrived
and
pierre
and
the
other
thirteen
were
led
to
the
devichye
field
the
day
was
clear
and
sunny
after
rain
and
the
air
was
extraordinarily
pure
the
smoke
did
not
spread
as
low
as
on
the
day
when
pierre
was
taken
from
the
guardhouse
of
the
zubovsky
rampart
the
smoke
rose
in
columns
in
the
pure
air
flames
were
not
to
be
seen
anywhere
but
columns
of
smoke
rose
on
all
sides
and
the
whole
of
moscow
all
that
pierre
could
see
of
it
was
one
charred
ruin
on
all
sides
one
could
see
waste
spaces
with
stoves
and
chimneys
and
occasionally
the
scorched
walls
of
stone
houses
pierre
looked
at
the
charred
ruins
and
did
not
recognize
the
familiar
quarters
of
the
city
here
and
there
he
could
see
intact
churches
the
kremlin
undestroyed
stood
white
in
the
distance
with
its
towers
and
ivan
the
great
nearby
the
dome
of
the
novodevichye
convent
gleamed
merrily
and
the
ringing
of
its
bells
could
be
heard
especially
clearly
this
bellringing
reminded
pierre
that
it
was
sunday
and
the
feast
of
the
nativity
of
the
mother
of
god
but
it
seemed
there
was
no
one
to
celebrate
the
feast
the
fires
devastation
was
everywhere
and
the
only
russians
to
be
met
with
now
and
then
were
ragged
frightened
people
who
hid
at
the
sight
of
the
french
obviously
the
russian
nest
was
devastated
and
destroyed
but
beyond
the
destruction
of
the
russian
order
of
life
pierre
felt
unconsciously
that
the
french
had
established
their
own
quite
different
but
firm
order
over
this
devastated
nest
he
felt
it
by
the
look
of
the
soldiers
who
marching
briskly
and
cheerfully
in
regular
ranks
escorted
him
along
with
the
other
criminals
he
felt
it
by
the
look
of
some
important
french
official
in
a
carriageandpair
driven
by
a
soldier
who
came
in
the
opposite
direction
he
felt
it
by
the
cheerful
sounds
of
regimental
music
coming
from
the
left
side
of
the
field
and
he
felt
it
and
realized
it
especially
by
the
list
which
in
the
roll
call
of
the
prisoners
was
read
out
by
the
french
officer
who
had
arrived
that
morning
pierre
had
been
arrested
by
one
group
of
soldiers
had
been
taken
to
one
place
and
then
another
with
dozens
of
other
people
it
seemed
they
might
have
forgotten
him
or
confused
him
with
others
but
no
the
answers
he
had
given
at
the
interrogation
came
back
to
him
in
the
form
of
his
designation
celui
qui
navoue
pas
son
nom
and
under
this
designation
which
frightened
pierre
he
was
now
led
somewhere
by
people
on
whose
faces
was
written
the
unquestioning
certainty
that
all
the
other
prisoners
and
he
himself
were
precisely
the
necessary
ones
and
were
being
taken
to
the
necessary
place
pierre
felt
like
an
insignificant
chip
of
wood
fallen
into
the
wheels
of
a
machine
unknown
to
him
but
functioning
well
pierre
and
the
other
criminals
were
taken
to
the
right
side
of
the
devichye
field
not
far
from
the
convent
to
a
big
white
house
with
a
huge
garden
this
was
the
house
of
prince
shcherbatov
in
which
pierre
had
often
visited
the
owner
and
in
which
as
he
learned
from
the
conversation
of
the
soldiers
the
marshal
the
duke
of
eckm252hl
was
now
installed
they
were
led
up
to
the
porch
and
brought
into
the
house
one
by
one
pierre
was
brought
in
sixth
through
the
glassedin
gallery
the
front
hall
the
anteroom
familiar
to
pierre
he
was
led
into
a
long
low
study
at
the
door
to
which
stood
an
adjutant
davout
was
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
room
over
a
table
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
pierre
went
up
close
to
him
davout
not
raising
his
eyes
was
evidently
examining
some
document
that
lay
before
him
without
raising
his
eyes
he
asked
softly
qui
234tesvous
pierre
was
silent
because
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
for
pierre
davout
was
not
simply
a
french
general
for
pierre
davout
was
a
man
known
for
his
cruelty
looking
at
the
cold
face
of
davout
who
like
a
stern
teacher
agreed
to
be
patient
for
a
time
and
wait
for
an
answer
pierre
felt
that
every
second
of
delay
might
cost
him
his
life
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
did
not
dare
to
say
what
he
had
said
at
the
first
interrogation
to
reveal
his
title
and
position
was
both
dangerous
and
shameful
pierre
was
silent
but
before
he
had
time
to
decide
on
something
davout
raised
his
head
raised
his
spectacles
to
his
forehead
narrowed
his
eyes
and
looked
fixedly
at
pierre
i
know
this
man
he
said
in
a
measured
and
cold
voice
obviously
calculated
to
frighten
pierre
the
chill
that
had
run
down
pierres
spine
earlier
now
seized
his
head
as
in
a
vice
mon

vous

ne

davout
interrupted
him
addressing
another
general
who
was
in
the
room
and
whom
pierre
had
not
noticed
and
davout
turned
away
in
an
unexpectedly
booming
voice
pierre
began
speaking
quickly
non
monseigneur
he
said
suddenly
recalling
that
davout
was
a
duke
non

monseigneur
exclaimed
pierre
not
in
an
offended
but
in
a
pleading
voice
davout
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
fixedly
at
pierre
for
a
few
seconds
they
looked
at
each
other
and
that
gaze
saved
pierre
in
that
gaze
beyond
all
the
conventions
of
war
and
courts
human
relations
were
established
between
these
two
men
in
that
one
moment
they
both
vaguely
felt
a
countless
number
of
things
and
realized
that
they
were
both
children
of
the
human
race
that
they
were
brothers
at
first
glance
for
davout
who
had
only
just
raised
his
head
from
his
list
where
human
deeds
and
life
were
known
by
numbers
pierre
was
only
a
circumstance
and
davout
could
have
shot
him
without
taking
a
bad
act
on
his
conscience
but
now
he
had
seen
him
as
a
human
being
he
reflected
for
a
moment
comment
me
prouverezvous
la
v233rit233
de
ce
que
vous
me
dites
davout
said
coldly
pierre
remembered
ramballe
and
named
him
and
his
regiment
and
the
street
where
the
house
was
vous
n234tes
pas
ce
que
vous

davout
said
again
in
a
trembling
faltering
voice
pierre
began
to
give
proofs
of
the
correctness
of
his
evidence
but
just
then
an
adjutant
came
in
and
reported
something
to
davout
davout
suddenly
beamed
at
the
news
told
him
by
the
adjutant
and
began
to
button
up
he
had
clearly
forgotten
all
about
pierre
when
the
adjutant
reminded
him
of
the
prisoner
he
nodded
frowning
in
pierres
direction
and
said
to
take
him
away
but
where
he
was
to
be
taken
pierre
did
not
know
back
to
the
shed
or
to
the
place
prepared
for
executions
which
his
comrades
had
shown
him
as
they
walked
through
the
devichye
field
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
the
adjutant
was
again
asking
something
oui
sans
doute
said
davout
but
yes
what
pierre
did
not
know
pierre
did
not
remember
how
long
he
walked
or
where
in
a
state
of
total
senselessness
and
torpor
seeing
nothing
around
him
he
moved
his
legs
along
with
the
others
until
they
all
stopped
and
he
stopped
too
there
was
one
thought
in
pierres
head
all
that
time
it
was
the
thought
of
who
finally
had
sentenced
him
to
be
executed
it
was
not
the
people
of
the
commission
that
had
interrogated
him
not
one
of
them
would
or
obviously
could
have
done
it
it
was
not
davout
who
had
given
him
such
a
human
look
another
moment
and
davout
would
have
understood
that
they
were
doing
a
bad
thing
but
the
adjutant
who
came
in
had
prevented
that
moment
and
that
adjutant
obviously
had
not
wanted
anything
bad
but
he
also
might
not
have
come
in
who
was
it
finally
who
was
executing
killing
depriving
of
life
himpierrewith
all
his
memories
longings
hopes
thoughts
who
was
doing
it
and
pierre
felt
that
it
was
no
one
it
was
the
order
of
things
the
turn
of
circumstances
some
order
of
things
was
killing
himpierredepriving
him
of
life
of
everything
annihilating
him
xi
from
prince
shcherbatovs
house
the
prisoners
were
taken
straight
down
the
devichye
field
to
the
left
of
the
devichye
convent
and
brought
to
the
kitchen
garden
where
a
post
stood
behind
the
post
a
large
pit
had
been
dug
with
freshly
dugup
earth
beside
it
and
a
large
crowd
of
people
were
standing
in
a
semicircle
around
the
pit
and
the
post
the
crowd
consisted
of
a
small
number
of
russians
and
a
large
number
of
napoleonic
troops
out
of
rank
germans
italians
and
french
in
various
uniforms
to
right
and
left
of
the
post
stood
lines
of
french
troops
in
blue
uniforms
with
red
epaulettes
in
leggings
and
shakos
the
criminals
were
placed
in
a
certain
order
which
was
on
the
list
pierre
was
sixth
and
led
to
the
post
several
drums
suddenly
began
to
beat
on
both
sides
and
pierre
felt
that
with
this
sound
it
was
as
if
his
soul
was
torn
away
he
lost
the
ability
to
think
and
reason
he
could
only
see
and
hear
and
he
had
only
one
desirethe
desire
that
whatever
terrible
thing
was
to
be
done
should
be
done
more
quickly
pierre
looked
around
at
his
comrades
and
studied
them
the
first
two
men
were
convicts
with
shaven
heads
one
was
tall
and
thin
the
other
dark
shaggy
and
muscular
with
a
flattened
nose
the
third
was
a
household
serf
of
about
fortyfive
with
grayish
hair
and
a
stout
wellstuffed
body
the
fourth
was
a
muzhik
a
very
handsome
one
with
a
bushy
blond
beard
and
dark
eyes
the
fifth
was
a
factory
worker
a
thin
yellowfaced
lad
of
about
eighteen
in
a
smock
pierre
heard
the
french
debate
about
how
to
shoot
themby
ones
or
by
twos
by
twos
the
senior
officer
said
coldly
and
calmly
there
was
movement
in
the
ranks
of
soldiers
and
it
was
noticeable
that
they
were
all
hurrying
and
hurrying
not
as
people
hurry
to
do
something
everyone
understands
but
as
they
hurry
in
order
to
finish
a
necessary
but
unpleasant
and
incomprehensible
business
a
french
official
in
a
sash
went
up
to
the
right
side
of
the
file
of
criminals
and
read
the
sentence
in
russian
and
in
french
then
two
pairs
of
frenchmen
went
up
to
the
criminals
and
on
instructions
from
the
officer
took
the
two
convicts
who
stood
first
in
line
the
convicts
having
gone
to
the
post
stopped
and
while
the
sacks
were
brought
looked
silently
around
them
as
a
wounded
animal
looks
at
the
approaching
hunter
one
kept
crossing
himself
the
other
kept
scratching
his
back
and
made
a
movement
with
his
lips
similar
to
a
smile
the
soldiers
their
hands
hurrying
set
about
blindfolding
them
putting
sacks
over
their
heads
and
tying
them
to
the
post
twelve
riflemen
with
muskets
left
the
ranks
with
measured
firm
strides
and
stopped
eight
paces
from
the
post
pierre
turned
away
so
as
not
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
suddenly
there
was
a
crackle
and
boom
that
to
pierre
seemed
louder
than
the
most
terrible
peals
of
thunder
and
he
turned
to
look
there
was
smoke
and
the
french
with
pale
faces
and
trembling
hands
were
doing
something
by
the
pit
another
two
were
led
up
in
the
same
way
with
the
same
eyes
these
two
also
looked
at
everyone
in
vain
with
their
eyes
only
silently
begging
for
protection
and
clearly
not
understanding
and
not
believing
what
was
going
to
happen
they
could
not
believe
it
because
they
alone
knew
what
their
life
was
for
them
and
therefore
did
not
understand
or
believe
that
it
could
be
taken
from
them
pierre
did
not
want
to
look
and
again
turned
away
but
again
it
was
as
if
a
terrible
explosion
struck
his
hearing
and
along
with
these
noises
he
saw
smoke
someones
blood
and
the
pale
frightened
faces
of
the
frenchmen
who
again
were
doing
something
by
the
post
pushing
each
other
with
trembling
hands
pierre
breathing
hard
looked
around
as
if
asking
what
does
it
mean
the
same
question
was
in
all
the
gazes
that
met
pierres
gaze
on
all
the
russian
faces
on
the
faces
of
the
french
soldiers
and
officers
on
all
without
exception
he
read
the
same
fear
horror
and
struggle
that
were
in
his
heart
but
who
finally
is
doing
this
theyre
all
suffering
just
as
i
am
who
is
it
who
flashed
for
a
second
in
pierres

shouted
they
led
away
the
fifth
man
who
was
standing
next
to
pierrealone
pierre
did
not
understand
that
he
was
saved
that
he
and
all
the
rest
had
been
brought
there
only
to
be
present
at
the
execution
with
everincreasing
horror
feeling
neither
joy
nor
relief
he
watched
what
was
being
done
the
fifth
man
was
the
factory
worker
in
the
smock
as
soon
as
they
touched
him
he
jumped
away
in
horror
and
clutched
at
pierre
pierre
shuddered
and
tore
free
of
him
the
factory
worker
was
unable
to
walk
he
was
dragged
under
the
arms
and
he
was
shouting
something
when
he
was
led
to
the
post
he
suddenly
fell
silent
it
was
as
if
he
suddenly
understood
something
either
he
understood
that
it
was
useless
to
shout
or
that
it
was
impossible
that
people
should
kill
him
but
he
stood
by
the
post
waiting
to
be
bound
as
the
others
had
been
and
like
a
wounded
animal
looked
around
with
glittering
eyes
pierre
could
no
longer
make
himself
turn
away
and
close
his
eyes
his
own
and
the
whole
crowds
curiosity
and
agitation
at
this
fifth
murder
had
reached
the
highest
pitch
like
the
others
this
fifth
man
seemed
calm
he
wrapped
himself
into
his
smock
and
scratched
his
leg
with
his
bare
foot
when
they
set
about
blindfolding
him
he
himself
straightened
the
knot
at
the
back
of
his
head
which
hurt
him
then
when
he
was
put
up
against
the
bloody
post
he
leaned
back
and
feeling
uncomfortable
in
that
position
straightened
up
placed
his
feet
level
and
leaned
back
comfortably
pierre
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
not
missing
the
slightest
movement
it
must
have
been
that
the
command
was
given
it
must
have
been
that
after
the
command
the
shots
of
eight
muskets
rang
out
but
pierre
much
as
he
tried
to
recall
later
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
of
the
shots
he
only
saw
how
the
factory
worker
suddenly
slumped
down
in
the
ropes
for
some
reason
how
blood
appeared
in
two
places
and
how
the
ropes
became
loose
under
the
weight
of
the
sagging
body
and
the
factory
worker
sat
down
lowering
his
head
and
tucking
his
legs
under
unnaturally
pierre
ran
to
the
post
no
one
held
him
back
frightened
pale
people
were
doing
something
around
the
factory
worker
the
lower
jaw
of
one
old
mustached
frenchman
was
trembling
as
he
untied
the
ropes
the
body
sank
down
the
soldiers
carried
it
clumsily
and
hastily
behind
the
post
and
began
to
push
it
down
into
the
pit
they
all
obviously
knew
without
question
that
they
were
criminals
who
had
to
quickly
conceal
the
traces
of
their
crime
pierre
glanced
into
the
pit
and
saw
the
factory
worker
lying
there
his
knees
up
close
to
his
head
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
and
that
shoulder
was
rising
and
falling
convulsively
and
regularly
but
shovelfuls
of
earth
were
already
being
strewn
over
the
whole
body
one
of
the
soldiers
angrily
spitefully
and
morbidly
shouted
at
pierre
to
get
back
but
pierre
did
not
understand
him
and
stood
by
the
post
and
nobody
drove
him
away
when
the
pit
was
all
filled
a
command
was
heard
pierre
was
taken
to
his
place
and
the
french
troops
standing
in
line
on
both
sides
of
the
post
made
a
half
turn
and
started
marching
past
it
at
a
measured
pace
the
twentyfour
riflemen
with
discharged
muskets
who
stood
in
the
center
of
the
circle
ran
to
take
their
places
as
their
companies
marched
past
them
pierre
now
looked
with
senseless
eyes
at
these
riflemen
who
ran
out
from
the
circle
in
pairs
all
except
one
joined
their
companies
a
young
soldier
with
a
deathly
pale
face
his
shako
pushed
back
his
musket
lowered
went
on
standing
across
from
the
pit
in
the
place
from
which
he
had
fired
he
was
reeling
like
a
drunk
man
taking
a
few
steps
forward
then
back
to
support
his
falling
body
an
old
sergeant
ran
out
from
the
ranks
and
seizing
the
young
soldiers
arm
pulled
him
into
the
company
the
crowd
of
russians
and
frenchmen
began
to
disperse
they
all
walked
silently
with
lowered
heads

incendier
someone
among
the
frenchmen
said
pierre
glanced
around
at
the
speaker
and
saw
that
it
was
a
soldier
who
wanted
to
comfort
himself
at
least
somehow
for
what
had
been
done
but
could
not
without
finishing
what
he
was
saying
he
waved
his
arm
and
walked
away
xii
after
the
execution
pierre
was
separated
from
the
other
accused
and
left
alone
in
a
small
devastated
and
befouled
church
before
evening
a
sergeant
of
the
guards
came
into
the
church
with
two
soldiers
and
announced
to
pierre
that
he
was
pardoned
and
would
now
go
to
the
barracks
of
the
prisoners
of
war
not
understanding
what
was
being
said
to
him
pierre
got
up
and
went
with
the
soldiers
he
was
brought
to
some
sheds
built
at
the
top
of
the
field
out
of
charred
boards
beams
and
rafters
and
led
into
one
of
them
in
the
darkness
some
twenty
different
people
surrounded
him
pierre
looked
at
them
not
understanding
who
these
people
were
and
why
and
what
they
wanted
of
him
he
heard
the
words
said
to
him
but
did
not
draw
any
conclusion
from
them
or
apply
them
to
anything
he
did
not
understand
their
meaning
he
replied
to
what
he
was
asked
but
did
not
reflect
on
who
was
listening
to
him
and
how
his
replies
would
be
taken
he
looked
at
their
faces
and
figures
but
they
all
seemed
equally
meaningless
to
him
from
the
moment
when
pierre
saw
this
horrible
murder
performed
by
people
who
did
not
want
to
do
it
it
was
as
if
the
spring
that
upheld
everything
and
made
it
seem
alive
had
been
pulled
from
his
soul
and
it
had
all
collapsed
into
a
heap
of
meaningless
trash
though
he
did
not
account
for
it
to
himself
his
faith
in
the
worlds
good
order
in
humanitys
and
his
own
soul
and
in
god
was
destroyed
pierre
had
experienced
this
state
before
but
never
with
such
force
as
now
before
when
doubts
of
this
sort
had
come
over
pierre
those
doubts
had
had
their
source
in
his
own
guilt
and
deep
in
his
soul
pierre
had
felt
then
that
salvation
from
that
despair
and
those
doubts
lay
in
himself
but
now
he
felt
that
it
was
not
his
guilt
that
caused
the
world
to
collapse
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
leave
only
meaningless
ruins
he
felt
that
to
return
to
faith
in
life
was
not
in
his
power
people
stood
around
him
in
the
darkness
surely
something
in
him
interested
them
very
much
they
were
telling
him
something
asking
him
about
something
then
they
led
him
somewhere
and
he
finally
found
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
shed
next
to
some
people
who
were
talking
and
laughing
on
all
sides
and
so
brothersthat
same
prince
who
the
voice
of
someone
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
shed
was
saying
with
special
emphasis
on
the
word
who
sitting
silently
and
motionlessly
by
the
wall
on
some
straw
pierre
now
opened
now
closed
his
eyes
but
as
soon
as
he
closed
his
eyes
he
saw
before
him
the
same
frightful
face
of
the
factory
worker
especially
frightening
in
its
simplicity
and
the
faces
of
his
involuntary
murderers
still
more
frightful
in
their
anxiety
and
he
would
open
his
eyes
again
and
look
senselessly
into
the
darkness
around
him
next
to
him
bending
over
sat
some
little
man
whose
presence
pierre
first
noticed
by
the
strong
smell
of
sweat
that
came
from
him
with
his
every
movement
this
man
was
doing
something
with
his
feet
in
the
darkness
and
though
pierre
could
not
see
his
face
he
felt
that
this
man
was
constantly
glancing
at
him
when
his
eyes
got
used
to
the
darkness
pierre
realized
that
this
man
was
taking
off
his
footcloths
and
the
way
he
was
doing
it
aroused
pierres
interest
having
untied
the
strips
with
which
one
foot
was
bound
he
folded
them
neatly
and
at
once
began
on
the
other
foot
glancing
up
at
pierre
while
one
hand
was
hanging
up
the
first
strips
the
other
was
already
beginning
to
unwrap
the
other
foot
in
this
accurate
fashion
with
rounded
deft
movements
that
followed
one
another
without
pause
the
man
unwrapped
his
feet
hung
the
wrappings
on
pegs
above
his
head
took
out
a
pocket
knife
cut
something
off
folded
the
knife
put
it
under
his
pillow
and
settling
himself
more
comfortably
put
his
arms
around
his
raised
knees
and
fixed
his
eyes
directly
on
pierre
pierre
felt
something
pleasant
soothing
and
rounded
in
these
deft
movements
in
this
wellarranged
domain
of
his
in
the
corner
even
in
the
smell
of
this
man
and
he
looked
at
him
without
taking
his
eyes
away
so
youve
seen
a
lot
of
misery
master
eh
the
little
man
suddenly
said
and
in
the
mans
melodious
voice
there
was
such
an
expression
of
tenderness
and
simplicity
that
pierre
wanted
to
reply
but
his
jaw
trembled
and
he
felt
tears
rising
the
little
man
in
that
same
second
not
giving
pierre
time
to
show
his
confusion
spoke
in
the
same
pleasant
voice
ah
dont
grieve
little
falcon
he
said
with
that
tenderly
melodious
gentleness
with
which
old
russian
women
speak
dont
grieve
little
friend
you
suffer
an
hour
you
live
an
age
so
it
is
my
dear
and
we
live
here
thank
god
with
no
offense
theres
bad
people
and
theres
good
he
said
and
while
speaking
shifted
his
weight
to
his
knees
in
a
supple
movement
got
up
and
clearing
his
throat
went
somewhere
so
shes
come
the
rascal
pierre
heard
the
same
gentle
voice
from
the
end
of
the
shed
shes
come
the
rascal
she
remembers
well
well
enough
and
the
soldier
pushing
away
a
little
dog
that
was
jumping
up
to
him
came
back
to
his
place
and
sat
down
in
his
hands
there
was
something
wrapped
in
a
rag
here
have
a
bite
to
eat
master
he
said
returning
again
to
his
respectful
tone
and
unwrapping
and
offering
pierre
several
baked
potatoes
there
was
soup
for
dinner
but
the
potatoes
are
grand
pierre
had
not
eaten
all
day
and
the
smell
of
the
potatoes
seemed
extraordinarily
pleasant
to
him
he
thanked
the
soldier
and
began
to
eat
what
just
like
that
the
soldier
said
smiling
and
he
took
one
of
the
potatoes
do
it
this
way
he
again
took
out
his
pocket
knife
cut
the
potato
into
two
equal
halves
on
his
palm
sprinkled
them
with
salt
from
the
rag
and
offered
them
to
pierre
grand
potatoes
he
repeated
thats
the
way
to
eat
them
it
seemed
to
pierre
that
he
had
never
eaten
anything
tastier
no
im
all
right
said
pierre
but
why
did
they
shoot
those
unfortunate
menthe
last
one
was
about
twenty
tsk
tsk
said
the
little
man
what
a
sin
what
a
sin
he
added
quickly
and
as
if
his
words
had
always
been
ready
in
his
mouth
and
flew
out
of
it
inadvertently
he
went
on
why
is
it
master
that
you
stayed
in
moscow
like
this
i
didnt
think
theyd
come
so
quickly
i
stayed
by
chance
said
pierre
how
did
they
take
you
little
falcon
from
your
own
house
no
i
went
to
the
fire
and
there
they
seized
me
and
tried
me
for
arson
where
theres
law
theres
lies
the
little
man
put
in
have
you
been
here
long
asked
pierre
chewing
the
last
potato

they
took
me
on
sunday
from
a
hospital
in
moscow
and
what
are
you
a
soldier
soldiers
of
the
apsheronsky
regiment
i
was
dying
of
fever
nobody
told
us
anything
there
were
about
twenty
of
our
men
lying
there
we
never
thought
never
imagined
and
what
is
it
sad
for
you
here
asked
pierre
how
could
it
not
be
little
falcon
my
names
platon
last
name
karataev
he
added
evidently
to
make
it
easier
for
pierre
to
address
him
they
nicknamed
me
little
falcon
in
the
service
how
can
you
not
be
sad
little
falcon
moscow
shes
the
mother
of
cities
how
can
you
not
be
sad
looking
at
that
well
the
worm
gnaws
the
cabbage
but
dies
before
hes
done
thats
what
the
old
folk
used
to
say
he
added
quickly
what
whats
that
you
said
asked
pierre
me
asked
karataev
i
said
man
proposes
god
disposes
he
said
thinking
he
was
repeating
what
he
had
said
and
he
went
on
at
once
so
then
master
have
you
got
family
estates
and
a
house
so
the
cups
overflowing
and
a
wife
are
your
old
parents
still
living
he
asked
and
though
pierre
could
not
see
it
in
the
darkness
he
sensed
that
the
soldiers
lips
were
puckered
in
a
restrained
smile
of
tenderness
as
he
asked
him
these
things
he
was
clearly
upset
that
pierre
had
no
parents
especially
no
mother
a
wife
for
advice
a
motherinlaw
for
welcome
but
no
ones
dearer
than
your
own
mother
he
said
well
but
are
there
children
he
went
on
asking
pierres
negative
answer
clearly
upset
him
and
he
hastened
to
add
so
what
youre
young
folk
god
grant
youll
still
have
some
only
live
in
good
accord
it
doesnt
matter
now
pierre
said
involuntarily
ah
you
dear
man
platon
retorted
theres
no
safety
from
the
beggars
sack
or
the
prisons
bars
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
and
cleared
his
throat
evidently
preparing
to
tell
a
long
story
and
so
my
gentle
friend
i
used
to
live
at
home
he
began
our
estate
was
a
prosperous
one
there
was
lots
of
land
the
muzhiks
lived
well
and
so
did
our
household
thank
god
my
good
father
went
out
to
mow
with
the
six
of
us
we
lived
well
we
were
real
christian
peasants
then
once
and
platon
karataev
told
a
long
story
of
how
he
went
to
another
mans
copse
beyond
the
forest
and
got
caught
by
the
watchman
how
they
flogged
him
tried
him
and
sent
him
for
a
soldier
what
then
little
falcon
he
said
in
a
voice
altered
by
a
smile
we
thought
it
was
grief
but
it
was
joy
if
it
wasnt
for
my
sin
my
brother
would
have
had
to
go
and
my
younger
brother
had
four
children
while
i
had
only
my
wife
left
you
see
there
was
a
daughter
but
god
took
her
before
i
was
sent
for
a
soldier
i
came
home
on
leave
ill
tell
you
i
looktheyre
living
better
than
ever
a
yard
full
of
little
stomachs
the
women
are
at
home
two
brothers
are
off
doing
hired
work
only
the
youngest
mikhailo

there
my
good
father
says
all
my
children

the
same
to
me
he
says
whichever
finger
you
bite
it
hurts
but
if
platon
hadnt
been
sent
then
mikhailo
would
have
had
to
go
he
called

he
says
thats
how
things
are
my
gentle
friend
fate
seeks
a
head
but
we
keep
judging
this
isnt
good
this
isnt
right
our
luck
is
like
water
in
a
fishnet
drag
it
and
it
swells
pull
it
out
and
nothings
there
so
it
is
and
platon
shifted
on
his
straw
after
some
silence
platon
got
up
i
suppose
you
must
be
sleepy
he
said
and
he
quickly
began
crossing
himself
saying
lord
jesus
christ
st
nicholas
frola
and
lavra
lord
jesus
christ
st
nicholas
frola
and
lavra
lord
jesus
christ
have
mercy
on
us
and
save
us
he
concluded
bowed
to
the
ground
stood
up
and
sighing
sat
on
his
straw
so
there
lord
lay
me
down
like
a
stone
raise
me
up
like
a
loaf
he
said
and
lay
down
pulling
his
greatcoat
over
him
what
was
that
prayer
you
recited
asked
pierre
eh
said
platon
he
was
already
asleep
what
did
i
recite
i
prayed
to
god
what
dont
you
pray

said
pierre
but
what
was
it
you
said
frola
and
lavra
of
course
platon
replied
quickly
its
the
horses
feast
beasts
should
also
be
pitied
said
karataev
look
how
shes
curled
up
the
rascal
got
nice
and
warm
the
daughter
of
a
bitch
he
said
touching
the
dog
at
his
feet
and
turning
over
again
he
fell
asleep
at
once
outside
weeping
and
shouting
could
be
heard
somewhere
in
the
distance
and
fire
could
be
seen
through
the
cracks
in
the
shed
but
inside
the
shed
it
was
quiet
and
dark
pierre
did
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
time
and
lay
in
his
place
in
the
dark
with
open
eyes
listening
to
the
regular
snoring
of
platon
who
lay
beside
him
and
he
felt
that
the
previously
destroyed
world
was
now
arising
in
his
soul
with
a
new
beauty
on
some
new
and
unshakeable
foundations
xiii
in
the
shed
that
pierre
entered
and
in
which
he
stayed
for
four
weeks
twentythree
soldiers
three
officers
and
two
officials
were
held
prisoner
later
pierre
pictured
them
all
as
in
a
fog
but
platon
karataev
remained
forever
in
pierres
soul
as
the
strongest
and
dearest
memory
and
the
embodiment
of
everything
russian
kindly
and
round
when
at
dawn
the
next
day
pierre
saw
his
neighbor
his
first
impression
of
something
round
was
fully
confirmed
the
whole
figure
of
platon
in
his
french
greatcoat
tied
with
a
rope
in
a
peaked
cap
and
bast
shoes
was
round
his
head
was
perfectly
round
his
back
chest
shoulders
even
his
arms
which
he
held
as
if
always
about
to
embrace
something
were
round
his
pleasant
smile
and
his
large
brown
tender
eyes
were
round
platon
karataev
must
have
been
over
fifty
judging
by
his
stories
of
the
campaigns
he
had
taken
long
ago
as
a
soldier
he
himself
did
not
know
and
had
no
way
of
determining
how
old
he
was
but
his
teeth
bright
white
and
strong
which
kept
popping
out
in
two
semicircles
when
he
laughed
which
he
often
did
were
all
sound
and
intact
there
was
not
a
single
gray
hair
in
his
beard
or
on
his
head
and
his
whole
body
had
an
air
of
suppleness
and
especially
of
firmness
and
hardiness
his
face
despite
its
small
round
wrinkles
had
an
expression
of
innocence
and
youth
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
melodious
but
the
main
peculiarity
of
his
speech
consisted
in
its
immediacy
and
promptness
he
evidently
never
thought
of
what
he
had
said
or
would
say
and
owing
to
that
there
was
in
the
quickness
and
certainty
of
his
intonation
a
special
irresistible
persuasiveness
his
physical
strength
and
agility
in
the
first
period
of
captivity
were
such
that
it
seemed
he
did
not
understand
what
fatigue
and
illness
were
every
evening
he
said
as
he
lay
down
lord
lay
me
down
like
a
stone
raise
me
up
like
a
loaf
in
the
morning
getting
up
he
always
said
shaking
his
shoulders
in
the
same
way
lay
down
in
a
curl
got
up
in
a
whirl
and
indeed
he
had
only
to
lie
down
in
order
to
fall
asleep
at
once
like
a
stone
and
he
had
only
to
shake
himself
in
order
to
set
about
doing
something
at
once
without
a
seconds
delay
the
way
children
on
getting
up
take
their
toys
he
knew
how
to
do
everything
not
very
well
but
not
badly
either
he
baked
cooked
sewed
planed
cobbled
boots
he
was
always
busy
and
only
at
night
allowed
himself
to
talk
which
he
liked
to
do
and
to
sing
he
sang
songs
not
as
singers
do
who
know
they
are
being
listened
to
but
as
birds
do
apparently
because
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
utter
those
sounds
as
it
is
necessary
to
stretch
ones
arms
or
legs
and
those
sounds
were
always
high
tender
almost
feminine
mournful
and
his
face
would
be
very
serious
as
he
sang
them
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
grown
a
beard
he
had
evidently
thrown
off
everything
assumed
alien
soldierly
and
involuntarily
returned
to
his
former
peasant
folkish
ways
a
soldier
on
leave
is
an
untucked
shirt
he
used
to
say
he
talked
reluctantly
about
his
time
as
a
soldier
though
he
did
not
complain
and
often
repeated
that
during
all
his
time
in
the
service
he
had
never
been
beaten
once
when
he
told
stories
they
were
mostly
stories
from
his
old
and
apparently
dear
memories
of
christian
as
he
pronounced
krestyan
life
the
proverbs
that
filled
his
speech
were
not
those
mostly
indecent
and
bold
proverbs
that
soldiers
use
but
those
folk
sayings
which
sound
so
insignificant
taken
separately
and
which
suddenly
acquire
a
profoundly
wise
significance
when
spoken
aptly
he
often
said
something
completely
opposite
to
what
he
had
said
before
but
both
the
one
and
the
other
were
right
he
liked
to
speak
and
spoke
well
adorning
his
speech
with
endearments
and
sayings
which
it
seemed
to
pierre
he
made
up
himself
but
the
main
charm
of
his
stories
was
that
in
what
he
said
the
simplest
events
sometimes
the
same
that
pierre
had
seen
without
noticing
them
acquired
a
character
of
solemn
seemliness
he
liked
listening
to
folktales
which
one
soldier
used
to
tell
in
the
evenings
always
the
same
ones
but
most
of
all
he
liked
listening
to
stories
from
real
life
he
smiled
joyfully
listening
to
such
stories
putting
a
word
in
and
asking
questions
tending
towards
clarifying
for
himself
the
seemliness
of
what
he
was
being
told
karataev
had
no
attachments
friendships
or
love
as
pierre
understood
them
but
he
loved
and
lived
lovingly
with
everything
that
life
brought
his
way
especially
other
peoplenot
any
specific
people
but
those
who
were
there
before
his
eyes
he
loved
his
mutt
his
comrades
the
french
he
loved
pierre
who
was
his
neighbor
but
pierre
sensed
that
despite
all
his
gentle
tenderness
towards
him
by
which
he
involuntarily
gave
pierres
spiritual
life
its
due
karataev
would
not
have
been
upset
for
a
moment
to
be
parted
from
him
and
pierre
was
beginning
to
experience
the
same
feeling
towards
karataev
platon
karataev
was
for
all
the
other
prisoners
the
most
ordinary
of
soldiers
they
called
him
little
falcon
or
platosha
teased
him
goodnaturedly
sent
him
on
errands
but
for
pierre
he
remained
forever
as
he
had
seen
him
the
first
night
the
unfathomable
round
and
eternal
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
simplicity
and
truth
platon
karataev
knew
nothing
by
heart
except
his
prayer
when
he
began
to
talk
it
seemed
he
did
not
know
how
he
was
going
to
finish
when
pierre
sometimes
struck
by
the
meaning
of
what
he
said
asked
him
to
repeat
it
platon
could
not
remember
what
he
had
said
the
moment
beforejust
as
he
could
not
tell
pierre
the
words
of
his
favorite
song
there
was
in
it
my
dear
one
little
birch
tree
and
im
sick
at
heart
but
the
words
did
not
make
any
sense
he
did
not
and
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
words
taken
separately
from
speech
each
of
his
words
and
each
of
his
acts
was
the
manifestation
of
an
activity
he
knew
nothing
about
which
was
his
life
but
his
life
as
he
looked
at
it
had
no
meaning
as
a
separate
life
it
had
meaning
only
as
a
the
whole
which
he
constantly
sensed
his
words
and
acts
poured
out
of
him
as
evenly
necessarily
and
immediately
as
fragrance
comes
from
a
flower
he
was
unable
to
understand
either
the
value
or
the
meaning
of
a
word
or
act
taken
separately
xiv
on
receiving
from
nikolai
the
news
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rostovs
in
yaroslavl
princess
marya
despite
her
aunts
dissuasions
at
once
made
ready
to
go
and
not
just
by
herself
but
with
her
nephew
whether
it
was
difficult
or
not
difficult
possible
or
impossible
she
did
not
ask
and
did
not
want
to
know
her
duty
was
not
only
to
be
at
the
side
of
her
perhaps
dying
brother
but
to
do
everything
possible
so
as
to
bring
his
son
to
him
and
therefore
she
made
ready
to
go
if
prince
andrei
had
not
informed
her
himself
princess
marya
explained
it
by
his
being
too
weak
to
write
or
considering
the
long
trip
too
difficult
and
dangerous
for
her
and
his
son
in
a
few
days
princess
marya
was
ready
for
the
road
her
carriages
consisted
of
the
enormous
princely
coach
in
which
she
had
come
to
voronezh
a
britzka
and
a
cart
with
her
went
mlle
bourienne
nikolushka
and
his
tutor
the
old
nanny
three
maids
tikhon
a
young
servant
and
a
footman
whom
her
aunt
sent
with
her
to
go
by
the
usual
road
to
moscow
was
unthinkable
and
princess
marya
therefore
had
to
take
a
roundabout
way
through
lipetsk
ryazan
vladimir
and
shuya
which
was
very
long
and
posthorses
being
unavailable
everywhere
very
hard
and
near
ryazan
where
they
said
the
french
had
appeared
even
dangerous
during
this
difficult
journey
mlle
bourienne
dessales
and
princess
maryas
servants
were
astonished
by
her
firmness
of
spirit
and
energy
she
was
the
last
to
go
to
bed
the
first
to
get
up
and
no
difficulties
could
stop
her
thanks
to
her
activity
and
energy
which
aroused
her
companions
by
the
end
of
the
second
week
they
were
approaching
yaroslavl
in
the
latter
her
stay
in
voronezh
princess
marya
had
experienced
the
best
happiness
of
her
life
her
love
for
rostov
no
longer
worried
or
upset
her
that
love
filled
all
her
soul
became
an
inalienable
her
and
she
no
longer
fought
against
it
most
recently
princess
marya
had
become
convincedthough
she
never
said
it
definitely
to
herself
in
clear
termsthat
she
loved
and
was
loved
she
had
become
convinced
of
it
during
her
last
meeting
with
nikolai
when
he
came
to
her
to
announce
that
her
brother
was
with
the
rostovs
nikolai
had
never
hinted
by
so
much
as
a
word
that
now
in
case
of
prince
andreis
recovery
the
former
relations
between
him
and
natasha
might
be
renewed
but
princess
marya
had
seen
by
his
face
that
he
knew
and
thought
it
and
in
spite
of
that
his
attitude
towards
hercareful
tender
and
lovingnot
only
had
not
changed
but
he
seemed
to
be
glad
that
this
family
relation
between
him
and
princess
marya
now
allowed
him
to
express
more
freely
his
loving
friendship
for
her
as
princess
marya
sometimes
thought
of
it
princess
marya
knew
that
she
was
in
love
for
the
first
and
last
time
of
her
life
and
felt
that
she
was
loved
and
was
happy
and
calm
in
that
respect
but
this
happiness
of
one
side
of
her
soul
not
only
did
not
prevent
her
from
feeling
the
full
force
of
her
grief
over
her
brother
but
on
the
contrary
this
inner
calm
in
one
respect
gave
her
a
greater
opportunity
to
give
herself
fully
to
her
feeling
for
her
brother
that
feeling
was
so
strong
in
the
first
moments
of
the
departure
from
voronezh
that
those
who
saw
her
off
were
convinced
looking
at
her
careworn
desperate
face
that
she
would
certainly
fall
ill
on
the
road
but
it
was
precisely
the
difficulties
and
cares
of
the
journey
which
princess
marya
took
in
hand
so
energetically
that
saved
her
for
a
time
from
grief
and
gave
her
strength
as
always
happens
during
a
journey
princess
marya
thought
only
about
the
journey
itself
forgetting
its
goal
but
as
they
approached
yaroslavl
when
there
again
emerged
what
she
might
face
and
not
after
many
days
but
that
same
evening
princess
maryas
agitation
reached
the
utmost
limits
when
the
footman
who
had
been
sent
ahead
to
find
out
where
the
rostovs
were
staying
in
yaroslavl
and
what
condition
prince
andrei
was
in
met
the
big
coach
entering
town
he
was
horrified
to
see
the
princesss
terribly
pale
face
thrust
out
at
him
through
the
window
ive
found
out
everything
your
excellency
the
rostovs
are
staying
on
the
square
in
the
house
of
the
merchant
bronnikov
its
not
far
just
on
the
bank
of
the
volga
said
the
footman
princess
marya
looked
fearfully
and
questioningly
into
his
face
not
understanding
why
he
did
not
answer
the
main
question
how
was
her
brother
mlle
bourienne
put
this
question
instead
of
the
princess
how
is
the
prince
she
asked
his
excellency
is
staying
in
the
same
house
with
them
that
means
hes
alive
thought
the
princess
and
she
asked
softly
how
he
was
the
people
said
hes
still
in
the
same
condition
what
still
in
the
same
condition
meant
the
princess
did
not
ask
but
with
only
a
fleeting
imperceptible
glance
at
the
sevenyearold
nikolushka
who
sat
facing
her
and
was
happy
to
see
the
city
she
lowered
her
head
and
did
not
raise
it
until
the
heavy
coach
rumbling
shaking
and
heaving
stopped
somewhere
the
footboards
banged
as
they
were
thrown
down
the
doors
were
opened
to
the
left
there
was
watera
big
river
to
the
right
was
a
porch
on
the
porch
there
were
people
servants
and
a
redcheeked
girl
with
a
big
black
braid
who
smiled
unpleasantly
and
falsely
as
it
seemed
to
princess
marya
this
was
sonya
the
princess
ran
up
the
steps
the
girl
with
the
false
smile
said
this
way
this
way
and
the
princess
found
herself
in
a
front
room
before
an
old
woman
with
an
oriental
type
of
face
who
with
a
moved
expression
was
quickly
coming
to
meet
her
it
was
the
countess
she
embraced
princess
marya
and
started
kissing
her
mon
enfant
she
said
je
vous
aime
et
je
vous
connais
depuis
longtemps
despite
all
her
agitation
princess
marya
realized
that
this
was
the
countess
and
that
she
had
to
say
something
to
her
not
knowing
why
herself
she
uttered
some
polite
french
words
in
the
same
tone
in
which
she
had
been
spoken
to
and
asked
how
is
he
the
doctor
says
theres
no
danger
said
the
countess
but
as
she
said
it
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
with
a
sigh
and
the
expression
of
this
gesture
contradicted
her
words
where
is
he
may
i
see
him
may
i
asked
the
princess
at
once
princess
at
once
my
dear
friend
is
this
his
son
she
said
turning
to
nikolushka
who
was
coming
in
with
dessales
theres
room
for
us
all
the
house
is
big
oh
what
a
lovely
boy
the
countess
led
the
princess
into
the
drawing
room
sonya
was
talking
with
mlle
bourienne
the
countess
caressed
the
boy
the
old
count
came
into
the
room
and
greeted
the
princess
the
old
count
had
changed
greatly
since
the
princess
had
last
seen
him
then
he
had
been
a
sprightly
cheerful
selfconfident
old
man
now
he
seemed
a
pitiful
lost
person
talking
with
the
princess
he
constantly
looked
around
as
if
asking
everyone
if
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
after
the
devastation
of
moscow
and
his
property
thrown
out
of
his
usual
rut
he
had
clearly
lost
the
awareness
of
his
significance
and
felt
that
he
no
longer
had
any
place
in
life
despite
all
her
agitation
despite
her
one
desire
to
see
her
brother
as
soon
as
possible
and
her
vexation
that
at
that
moment
when
all
she
wanted
was
to
see
him
they
distracted
her
and
pretended
to
praise
her
nephew
the
princess
noticed
everything
that
was
going
on
around
her
and
felt
the
need
to
submit
for
a
time
to
this
new
order
she
was
entering
she
knew
that
all
this
was
necessary
and
though
it
was
hard
for
her
she
was
not
vexed
with
them
this
is
my
niece
said
the
count
introducing
sonya
have
you
met
her
princess
the
princess
turned
to
her
and
trying
to
stifle
the
animosity
for
this
girl
that
arose
in
her
heart
kissed
her
but
she
was
beginning
to
be
pained
because
the
mood
of
everyone
around
her
was
so
far
from
all
that
was
in
her
soul
where
is
he
she
asked
once
more
addressing
them
all
hes
downstairs
natashas
with
him
sonya
replied
blushing
ive
sent
to
inquire
you
must
be
tired
princess
tears
of
vexation
came
to
the
princesss
eyes
she
turned
away
and
was
again
about
to
ask
the
countess
how
to
go
to
him
when
light
impetuous
as
if
merry
footsteps
were
heard
at
the
door
the
princess
looked
and
saw
natasha
almost
running
in
that
natasha
whom
she
had
so
disliked
when
they
had
met
in
moscow
long
ago
but
the
princess
had
barely
glanced
at
the
face
of
this
natasha
when
she
understood
that
this
was
a
sincere
companion
in
grief
and
therefore
her
friend
she
rushed
to
meet
her
and
embracing
her
burst
into
tears
on
her
shoulder
as
soon
as
natasha
who
had
been
sitting
by
prince
andreis
head
learned
of
princess
maryas
arrival
she
quietly
left
the
room
on
those
quick
stepsmerry
as
it
had
seemed
to
princess
maryaand
ran
to
her
on
her
anxious
face
when
she
ran
into
the
room
there
was
only
one
expressionan
expression
of
love
of
boundless
love
for
him
for
her
for
everything
that
was
close
to
the
man
she
loved
an
expression
of
pity
of
suffering
for
others
and
a
passionate
desire
to
give
all
of
herself
to
help
them
it
was
clear
that
at
that
moment
there
was
not
a
single
thought
of
herself
or
her
relations
to
him
in
natashas
soul
the
sensitive
princess
marya
understood
all
that
from
her
first
glance
at
natashas
face
and
with
grieving
pleasure
she
wept
on
her
shoulder
come
come
to
him
marie
said
natasha
leading
her
to
the
other
room
princess
marya
raised
her
face
wiped
her
tears
and
turned
to
natasha
she
felt
that
from
her
she
would
understand
and
learn
everything
how
is
she
began
the
question
but
suddenly
stopped
she
felt
that
it
was
impossible
either
to
ask
or
to
answer
in
words
natashas
face
and
eyes
would
tell
her
more
clearly
and
profoundly
natasha
looked
at
her
but
seemed
to
be
afraid
and
doubtful
whether
to
tell
all
she
knew
it
was
as
if
she
felt
before
those
luminous
eyes
which
penetrated
to
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
tell
the
whole
truth
as
she
saw
it
natashas
lip
suddenly
trembled
ugly
wrinkles
formed
around
her
mouth
and
bursting
into
sobs
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
princess
marya
understood
everything
but
even
so
she
hoped
and
asked
in
words
she
did
not
believe
in
but
how
is
his
wound
what
condition
is
he
in
generally
youyoull
see
was
all
natasha
could
say
they
sat
for
a
while
downstairs
near
his
room
in
order
to
stop
crying
and
go
in
with
calm
faces
how
has
the
whole
illness
gone
has
he
been
worse
for
long
when
did
this
happen
asked
princess
marya
natasha
told
her
that
at
first
there
had
been
danger
from
his
high
fever
and
suffering
but
in
the
trinity
monastery
that
had
gone
away
and
the
doctor
had
been
afraid
of
only
one
thinggangrene
but
that
danger
too
had
passed
when
they
arrived
in
yaroslavl
the
wound
had
begun
to
fester
natasha
knew
everything
to
do
with
festering
and
so
on
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
the
festering
might
take
the
right
course
there
was
fever
the
doctor
had
said
that
this
fever
was
not
dangerous
but
two
days
ago
natasha
began
this
suddenly
happened
she
suppressed
her
sobs
i
dont
know
but
youll
see
how
hes
become
hes
grown
weaker
thinner
asked
the
princess
no
not
that
but
worse
youll
see
ah
marie
marie
hes
too
good
he
cant
he
cant
live
because
xv
when
natasha
opened
his
door
with
a
habitual
movement
letting
the
princess
go
ahead
of
her
princess
marya
felt
her
sobs
ready
in
her
throat
much
as
she
had
prepared
herself
had
tried
to
calm
down
she
knew
she
would
not
be
able
to
see
him
without
tears
princess
marya
understood
what
natasha
had
meant
by
the
words
this
happened
to
him
two
days
ago
she
understood
that
it
meant
he
had
suddenly
softened
and
that
this
softening
and
tender
feeling
were
signs
of
death
as
she
was
going
to
the
door
she
already
saw
in
her
imagination
the
face
of
the
andryusha
she
had
known
in
childhood
gentle
mild
tender
which
he
showed
so
rarely
and
which
therefore
always
affected
her
so
strongly
she
knew
that
he
would
speak
quiet
gentle
words
to
her
like
those
her
father
had
spoken
to
her
before
his
death
and
she
would
be
unable
to
bear
it
and
would
burst
into
sobs
over
him
but
sooner
or
later
it
had
to
be
and
so
she
went
into
the
room
the
sobs
rose
higher
and
higher
in
her
throat
as
her
nearsighted
eyes
made
out
his
form
more
and
more
clearly
and
sought
his
features
and
then
she
saw
his
face
and
met
his
gaze
he
was
lying
on
a
sofa
surrounded
by
pillows
in
a
squirrelfur
dressing
gown
he
was
thin
and
pale
one
thin
transparently
white
hand
was
holding
a
handkerchief
the
other
with
a
quiet
movement
of
the
fingers
was
touching
his
thin
newly
grown
mustache
his
eyes
were
looking
at
the
entering
women
seeing
his
face
and
meeting
his
gaze
princess
marya
suddenly
slowed
her
steps
and
felt
that
her
tears
had
suddenly
dried
up
and
her
sobs
had
ceased
catching
the
expression
of
his
face
and
gaze
she
suddenly
grew
timid
and
felt
guilty
but
what
am
i
guilty
of
she
asked
herself
of
being
alive
and
thinking
about
the
living
while
i
his
cold
stern
gaze
replied
there
was
almost
hostility
in
that
deep
gaze
looking
not
out
of
but
into
himself
as
he
slowly
examined
his
sister
and
natasha
they
took
each
others
hands
and
kissed
each
other
as
was
their
habit
hello
marie
how
is
it
that
you
got
here
he
said
in
a
voice
as
flat
and
alien
as
was
his
gaze
if
he
had
shrieked
in
a
desperate
voice
that
shriek
would
have
terrified
princess
marya
less
than
the
sound
of
that
voice
and
youve
brought
nikolushka
he
said
just
as
flatly
and
slowly
and
with
an
obvious
effort
of
recollection
how
is
your
health
now
asked
princess
marya
marveling
at
herself
as
she
said
it
that
my
friend
you
must
ask
the
doctor
he
said
and
clearly
making
another
effort
to
be
gentle
he
said
with
his
lips
only
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
at
all
think
what
he
was
saying
merci
ch232re
amie
d234tre
venue
princess
marya
pressed
his
hand
he
winced
barely
noticeably
from
the
pressure
of
her
hand
he
was
silent
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
understood
what
had
happened
to
him
in
those
two
days
in
his
words
in
his
tone
especially
in
that
gazea
cold
almost
hostile
gazethere
could
be
felt
an
alienation
from
everything
of
this
world
that
was
frightening
in
a
living
man
he
clearly
had
difficulty
now
in
understanding
anything
living
but
at
the
same
time
it
could
be
felt
that
he
did
not
understand
the
living
not
because
he
lacked
the
power
of
understanding
but
because
he
understood
something
else
such
as
the
living
could
not
understand
and
which
absorbed
him
entirely
yes
see
how
strangely
fate
has
brought
us
together
he
said
breaking
his
silence
and
pointing
to
natasha
shes
taking
care
of
me
princess
marya
listened
and
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
how
could
he
the
sensitive
gentle
prince
andrei
say
that
in
the
presence
of
the
one
he
loved
and
who
loved
him
if
he
had
thought
he
would
live
he
would
not
have
said
it
in
such
a
coldly
offensive
tone
if
he
had
not
known
he
would
die
how
could
he
not
have
pitied
her
how
could
he
have
said
it
in
front
of
her
the
only
explanation
could
be
that
it
made
no
difference
to
him
and
it
made
no
difference
because
something
else
more
important
had
been
revealed
to
him
the
conversation
was
cold
incoherent
and
constantly
interrupted
marie
came
through
ryazan
said
natasha
prince
andrei
did
not
notice
that
she
had
called
his
sister
marie
and
natasha
calling
her
that
in
his
presence
noticed
it
herself
for
the
first
time
well
and
what
about
it
he
said
they
told
her
that
moscow
is
all
burned
down
completely
that
supposedly
natasha
stopped
it
was
impossible
to
speak
he
was
obviously
making
an
effort
to
listen
and
still
could
not
yes
they
say
its
burned
down
he
said
thats
a
great
pity
and
he
began
to
look
straight
ahead
absentmindedly
stroking
his
mustache
with
his
fingers
and
youve
met
count
nikolai
marie
prince
andrei
said
suddenly
clearly
wishing
to
please
them
he
wrote
here
that
he
found
you
very
much
to
his
liking
he
went
on
simply
calmly
clearly
unable
to
understand
all
the
complex
significance
his
words
had
for
living
people
if
you
should
also
like
him
it
would
be
very
goodif
you
got
married
he
added
somewhat
more
quickly
as
if
glad
of
the
words
he
had
long
been
searching
for
and
had
finally
found
princess
marya
heard
his
words
but
they
had
no
other
meaning
for
her
than
to
prove
how
terribly
far
he
now
was
from
everything
living
why
talk
of
me
she
said
calmly
and
glanced
at
natasha
natasha
feeling
her
gaze
upon
her
did
not
look
at
her
again
they
all
fell
silent
andr233
would
you
li
princess
marya
suddenly
said
in
a
shuddering
voice
would
you
like
to
see
nikolushka
he
talks
about
you
all
the
time
prince
andrei
smiled
barely
perceptibly
for
the
first
time
but
princess
marya
who
knew
his
face
so
well
understood
with
horror
that
this
was
a
smile
not
of
joy
not
of
tenderness
for
his
son
but
of
quiet
mild
mockery
of
princess
marya
who
in
his
opinion
was
using
her
last
means
of
bringing
him
to
his
senses
yes
im
very
glad
nikolushka
is
here
is
he
well
when
nikolushka
was
brought
to
prince
andrei
he
looked
at
his
father
with
fear
but
did
not
cry
because
no
one
was
crying
prince
andrei
kissed
him
and
obviously
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
when
nikolushka
was
taken
away
princess
marya
went
up
to
her
brother
once
more
kissed
him
and
unable
to
control
herself
any
longer
began
to
cry
he
looked
at
her
intently
is
it
about
nikolushka
he
asked
princess
marya
crying
nodded
affirmatively
marie
do
you
know
the
gosp
but
he
suddenly
fell
silent
what
did
you
say
nothing
you
mustnt
cry
here
he
said
looking
at
her
with
the
same
cold
gaze
when
princess
marya
began
to
cry
he
understood
that
she
was
crying
because
nikolushka
would
be
left
without
a
father
making
a
great
effort
with
himself
he
attempted
to
come
back
into
life
and
shift
to
their
point
of
view
yes
this
must
seem
pitiful
to
them
he
thought
yet
its
so
simple
the
birds
of
the
air
neither
sow
nor
reap
but
your
father
feeds
them
he
said
to
himself
and
wanted
to
say
it
to
the
princess
but
no
theyll
understand
it
their
own
way
they
wont
understand
this
they
cannot
understand
that
all
these
feelings
they
value
all
these
thoughts
of
ours
which
seem
so
important
to
usthat
theyre
unnecessary
we
cannot
understand
each
other
and
he
kept
silent
prince
andreis
little
son
was
seven
years
old
he
could
barely
read
he
knew
nothing
he
lived
through
many
things
after
that
day
acquiring
knowledge
power
of
observation
experience
but
if
he
had
then
possessed
all
these
abilities
he
acquired
later
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
understand
the
full
meaning
of
the
scene
he
saw
take
place
between
his
father
princess
marya
and
natasha
any
better
any
more
profoundly
than
he
understood
it
now
he
understood
everything
and
without
crying
left
the
room
silently
went
up
to
natasha
who
came
out
after
him
glanced
at
her
bashfully
with
his
thoughtful
beautiful
eyes
his
slightly
raised
red
upper
lip
quivered
he
leaned
his
head
against
natasha
and
began
to
cry
from
that
day
on
he
avoided
dessales
avoided
the
countess
who
caressed
him
and
either
sat
by
himself
or
timidly
approached
princess
marya
and
natasha
whom
he
seemed
to
have
come
to
love
more
than
his
aunt
and
quietly
and
bashfully
caressed
them
princess
marya
having
left
prince
andrei
fully
understood
all
that
natashas
face
had
said
to
her
she
did
not
talk
anymore
with
natasha
about
the
hope
of
saving
his
life
she
took
turns
with
her
by
his
sofa
and
did
not
cry
anymore
but
prayed
constantly
in
her
soul
addressing
the
eternal
the
unfathomable
whose
presence
over
the
dying
man
was
now
so
palpable
xvi
prince
andrei
not
only
knew
that
he
would
die
but
felt
that
he
was
dying
that
he
was
already
half
dead
he
experienced
an
awareness
of
estrangement
from
everything
earthly
and
a
joyful
and
strange
lightness
of
being
without
haste
or
worry
he
waited
for
what
lay
ahead
of
him
the
dread
the
eternal
the
unknown
and
far
off
of
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
feel
the
presence
throughout
his
life
was
now
close
to
him
andby
that
strange
lightness
of
being
he
experiencedalmost
comprehensible
and
palpable
formerly
he
had
been
afraid
of
the
end
twice
he
had
experienced
that
frightful
tormenting
feeling
of
the
fear
of
death
the
end
and
now
he
no
longer
understood
it
the
first
time
he
had
experienced
that
feeling
was
when
the
shell
was
spinning
before
him
like
a
top
and
he
looked
at
the
harvested
field
at
the
bushes
at
the
sky
and
knew
that
death
was
before
him
when
he
regained
consciousness
after
being
wounded
and
in
his
soul
instantly
as
if
freed
of
the
restraining
weight
of
life
that
flower
of
love
opened
eternal
free
not
bound
to
this
life
he
was
no
longer
afraid
of
death
and
did
not
think
of
it
in
those
hours
of
suffering
solitude
and
half
delirium
that
he
spent
after
being
wounded
the
more
he
pondered
the
new
principle
of
eternal
love
revealed
to
him
the
more
though
without
feeling
it
himself
he
renounced
earthly
life
to
love
everything
everybody
always
to
sacrifice
oneself
for
love
meant
to
love
no
one
meant
not
to
live
this
earthly
life
and
the
more
imbued
he
was
with
this
principle
of
love
the
more
he
renounced
life
and
the
more
completely
he
destroyed
that
dreadful
barrier
which
without
love
stands
between
life
and
death
when
in
that
first
time
he
remembered
that
he
had
to
die
he
said
to
himself
well
so
much
the
better
but
after
that
night
in
mytishchi
when
in
his
half
delirium
she
whom
he
wished
for
appeared
before
him
and
when
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
wept
quiet
joyful
tears
love
for
one
woman
crept
imperceptibly
into
his
heart
and
again
bound
him
to
life
joyful
and
worried
thoughts
started
coming
to
him
remembering
that
moment
at
the
dressing
station
when
he
had
seen
kuragin
he
now
could
not
return
to
that
feeling
he
was
tormented
by
the
question
of
whether
the
man
was
still
alive
and
he
did
not
dare
ask
it
his
illness
was
following
its
physical
course
but
what
natasha
called
this
happened
to
him
occurred
two
days
before
princess
maryas
arrival
it
was
the
last
moral
struggle
between
life
and
death
in
which
death
gained
the
victory
it
was
the
unexpected
awareness
that
he
still
valued
life
as
it
presented
itself
to
him
in
his
love
for
natasha
and
a
last
finally
surmounted
attack
of
terror
before
the
unknown
it
was
in
the
evening
as
usual
after
dinner
he
was
in
a
slightly
feverish
state
and
his
thoughts
were
extremely
clear
sonya
was
sitting
at
the
table
he
dozed
off
suddenly
a
sense
of
happiness
came
over
him
ah
its
that
shes
come
he
thought
indeed
natasha
who
had
just
come
in
with
inaudible
steps
was
sitting
in
sonyas
place
since
she
had
begun
to
take
care
of
him
he
had
always
experienced
this
physical
sense
of
her
nearness
she
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
turned
sideways
to
him
shielding
the
light
of
the
candle
from
him
and
knitting
a
stocking
she
had
learned
to
knit
stockings
since
prince
andrei
told
her
that
no
one
could
take
such
good
care
of
the
sick
as
old
nannies
who
knit
stockings
and
that
there
was
something
soothing
about
the
knitting
of
stockings
her
slender
fingers
moved
quickly
occasionally
clicking
the
needles
and
he
could
see
clearly
the
thoughtful
profile
of
her
lowered
face
she
made
a
movementthe
ball
of
yarn
rolled
off
her
lap
she
gave
a
start
glanced
around
at
him
and
shielding
the
candle
with
her
hand
bent
down
in
a
cautious
supple
and
precise
movement
picked
up
the
ball
and
sat
in
her
former
position
he
looked
at
her
without
stirring
and
saw
that
after
her
movement
she
needed
to
take
a
deep
breath
but
did
not
dare
to
do
it
and
caught
her
breath
cautiously
in
the
trinity
monastery
they
had
talked
about
the
past
and
he
had
told
her
that
if
he
should
live
he
would
eternally
thank
god
for
his
wound
which
had
brought
them
together
again
but
since
then
they
had
never
talked
about
the
future
could
it
be
or
not
he
thought
now
looking
at
her
and
listening
to
the
slight
noise
of
the
steel
needles
can
it
be
that
fate
brought
us
together
so
strangely
only
so
that
i
should
diecan
it
be
that
the
truth
of
life
was
revealed
to
me
only
so
that
i
should
live
in
a
lie
i
love
her
more
than
anything
in
the
world
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
love
her
he
said
and
suddenly
moaned
involuntarily
by
a
habit
acquired
during
his
sufferings
hearing
this
sound
natasha
put
down
the
stocking
leaned
in
his
direction
and
suddenly
noticing
his
shining
eyes
went
over
to
him
on
light
steps
and
bent
down
youre
not
asleep
no
ive
been
looking
at
you
for
a
long
time
i
felt
it
when
you
came
in
no
one
but
you
gives
me
that
soft
silencethat
light
i
want
to
weep
for
joy
natasha
moved
closer
to
him
her
face
beamed
with
rapturous
joy
natasha
i
love
you
too
much
more
than
anything
in
the
world
and
i
she
turned
away
for
a
moment
why
too
much
she
asked
why
too
muchwell
what
do
you
think
what
do
you
feel
in
your
soul
in
your
whole
soulwill
i
live
how
does
it
seem
to
you
im
sure
of
it
sure
of
it
natasha
almost
cried
out
taking
both
his
hands
in
a
passionate
movement
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
how
good
it
would
be
and
taking
her
hand
he
kissed
it
natasha
was
happy
and
excited
and
she
remembered
at
once
that
this
was
forbidden
that
he
needed
to
be
quiet
you
didnt
sleep
though
she
said
suppressing
her
joy
try
to
fall
asleepplease
he
let
go
of
her
hand
after
pressing
it
and
she
went
over
to
the
candle
and
sat
down
again
in
the
same
position
twice
she
turned
to
glance
at
him
and
his
eyes
shone
meeting
hers
she
set
to
work
on
the
stocking
and
said
to
herself
that
she
would
not
look
at
him
until
it
was
finished
indeed
soon
after
that
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
he
slept
for
a
short
time
and
suddenly
woke
up
anxiously
in
a
cold
sweat
falling
asleep
he
was
thinking
about
the
same
thing
he
had
been
thinking
about
all
that
timeabout
life
and
death
and
more
about
death
he
felt
himself
closer
to
it
love
what
is
love
he
thought
love
hinders
death
love
is
life
everything
everything
i
understand
i
understand
only
because
i
love
everything
is
everything
exists
only
because
i
love
everything
is
connected
only
by
that
love
is
god
and
to
diemeans
that
i
a
love
return
to
the
common
and
eternal
source
these
thoughts
seemed
comforting
to
him
but
they
were
only
thoughts
something
was
lacking
in
them
there
was
something
onesidedly
personal
cerebralthere
was
no
evidence
and
there
was
the
same
uneasiness
and
vagueness
he
fell
asleep
in
a
dream
he
saw
himself
lying
in
the
same
room
in
which
he
lay
in
reality
but
he
was
not
wounded
but
healthy
many
sorts
of
persons
insignificant
indifferent
appear
before
prince
andrei
he
talks
with
them
argues
about
something
unnecessary
they
are
preparing
to
go
somewhere
prince
andrei
vaguely
recalls
that
it
is
all
insignificant
and
that
he
has
other
more
important
concerns
but
he
goes
on
to
their
surprise
speaking
some
sort
of
empty
witty
words
gradually
imperceptibly
all
these
people
begin
to
disappear
and
everything
is
replaced
by
the
one
question
of
the
closed
door
he
gets
up
and
goes
to
the
door
to
slide
the
bolt
and
lock
it
everything
depends
on
whether
he
does
or
does
not
manage
to
lock
it
he
walks
he
hurries
his
feet
do
not
move
and
he
knows
that
he
will
not
manage
to
lock
the
door
but
still
he
painfully
strains
all
his
force
and
a
tormenting
fear
seizes
him
and
this
fear
is
the
fear
of
death
it
is
standing
behind
the
door
but
as
he
is
crawling
strengthlessly
and
awkwardly
towards
the
door
this
terrible
something
is
already
pushing
against
it
from
the
other
side
forcing
it
something
inhumandeathis
forcing
the
door
and
he
has
to
hold
it
shut
he
lays
hold
of
the
door
strains
in
a
last
effortto
lock
it
is
already
impossiblejust
to
hold
it
shut
but
his
attempts
are
weak
clumsy
and
pushed
by
the
terrible
thing
the
door
keeps
opening
and
shutting
again
once
more
it
pushes
from
the
other
side
his
last
supernatural
efforts
are
in
vain
and
the
two
halves
open
noiselessly
it
comes
in
and
it
is
death
and
prince
andrei
died
but
in
the
same
instant
that
he
died
prince
andrei
remembered
that
he
was
asleep
and
in
the
same
instant
that
he
died
he
made
an
effort
with
himself
and
woke
up
yes
that
was
death
i
diedi
woke
up
yes
death
is
an
awakening
clarity
suddenly
came
to
his
soul
and
the
curtain
that
until
then
had
concealed
the
unknown
was
raised
before
his
inner
gaze
he
felt
the
release
of
a
force
that
previously
had
been
as
if
bound
in
him
and
that
strange
lightness
which
from
then
on
did
not
leave
him
when
having
come
to
in
a
cold
sweat
he
stirred
on
his
sofa
natasha
went
over
to
him
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
he
did
not
answer
and
not
understanding
her
gave
her
a
strange
look
that
was
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
princess
maryas
arrival
since
that
day
the
doctor
said
the
wasting
fever
had
taken
a
turn
for
the
worse
but
natasha
was
not
interested
in
what
the
doctor
said
she
saw
those
dreadful
moral
signs
which
were
more
unquestionable
for
her
since
that
day
there
began
for
prince
andrei
along
with
his
awakening
from
sleep
an
awakening
from
life
and
it
seemed
no
slower
to
him
in
relation
to
the
length
of
life
than
an
awakening
from
sleep
in
relation
to
the
length
of
a
dream
there
was
nothing
frightening
and
abrupt
in
this
relatively
slow
awakening
his
last
days
and
hours
passed
ordinarily
and
simply
both
princess
marya
and
natasha
who
never
left
his
side
felt
it
they
did
not
weep
did
not
shudder
and
during
the
last
time
they
themselves
felt
that
they
were
no
longer
taking
care
of
him
he
was
no
longer
there
he
had
left
them
but
of
the
nearest
reminder
of
himhis
body
the
feelings
of
both
were
so
strong
that
they
were
not
affected
by
the
external
dreadful
side
of
death
and
they
found
no
need
to
exacerbate
their
grief
they
did
not
weep
either
with
him
or
without
him
but
also
never
spoke
of
him
between
themselves
they
felt
that
they
could
not
express
what
they
understood
in
words
they
both
saw
how
he
sank
deeper
and
deeper
slowly
and
peacefully
somewhere
away
from
them
and
they
both
knew
that
it
had
to
be
so
and
that
it
was
good
he
confessed
took
communion
everyone
came
to
him
for
a
last
farewell
when
his
son
was
brought
to
him
he
touched
him
with
his
lips
and
turned
away
not
because
he
felt
grief
or
pity
princess
marya
and
natasha
understood
that
but
only
because
he
supposed
that
this
was
all
that
was
expected
of
him
but
when
he
was
told
to
bless
him
he
did
as
they
requested
and
looked
around
as
if
asking
if
anything
else
needed
to
be
done
when
the
last
shudderings
of
the
body
being
left
by
the
spirit
occurred
princess
marya
and
natasha
were
there
is
it
over
said
princess
marya
after
his
body
had
already
lain
motionless
before
them
for
several
minutes
growing
cold
natasha
went
up
looked
into
the
dead
eyes
and
hastened
to
close
them
she
closed
them
and
did
not
kiss
them
but
pressed
her
lips
to
that
which
was
her
nearest
reminder
of
him
where
has
he
gone
where
is
he
now
when
the
clothed
washed
body
lay
in
the
coffin
on
the
table
they
all
went
up
to
it
for
a
last
farewell
and
they
all
wept
nikolushka
wept
from
a
suffering
bewilderment
that
rent
his
heart
the
countess
and
sonya
wept
from
pity
for
poor
natasha
and
because
he
was
no
more
the
old
count
wept
because
he
felt
that
soon
he
too
would
have
to
take
that
dreadful
step
natasha
and
princess
marya
also
wept
now
but
they
did
not
weep
from
their
own
personal
grief
they
wept
from
a
reverent
emotion
that
came
over
their
souls
before
the
awareness
of
the
simple
and
solemn
mystery
of
death
that
had
been
accomplished
before
them
i
the
totality
of
causes
of
phenomena
is
inaccessible
to
the
human
mind
but
the
need
to
seek
causes
has
been
put
into
the
soul
of
man
and
the
human
mind
without
grasping
in
their
countlessness
and
complexity
the
conditions
of
phenomena
of
which
each
separately
may
appear
as
a
cause
takes
hold
of
the
first
most
comprehensible
approximation
and
says
here
is
the
cause
in
historical
events
where
the
subject
of
observation
is
the
actions
of
people
the
most
primordial
approximation
appears
as
the
will
of
the
gods
then
as
the
will
of
those
people
who
stand
in
the
most
conspicuous
historical
placethe
historical
heroes
but
we
need
only
inquire
into
the
essence
of
any
historical
event
that
is
into
the
activity
of
the
entire
mass
of
people
who
took
the
event
to
become
convinced
that
the
will
of
the
historical
hero
not
only
does
not
guide
the
actions
of
the
masses
but
is
itself
constantly
guided
it
would
seem
to
make
no
difference
whether
we
understand
the
meaning
of
historical
events
this
way
or
that
but
between
a
man
who
says
that
the
people
of
the
west
went
to
the
east
because
napoleon
wanted
it
and
the
man
who
says
that
it
happened
because
it
had
to
happen
there
is
the
same
difference
as
between
the
people
who
maintained
that
the
earth
stood
still
and
the
planets
moved
around
it
and
those
who
said
that
they
did
not
know
what
upheld
the
earth
but
knew
that
there
were
laws
governing
its
movement
and
that
of
the
other
planets
there
are
not
and
cannot
be
any
causes
of
a
historical
event
except
for
the
one
cause
of
all
causes
but
there
are
laws
that
govern
events
which
are
partly
unknown
partly
groped
for
by
us
the
discovery
of
these
laws
is
possible
only
when
we
wholly
give
up
looking
for
causes
in
the
will
of
one
man
just
as
discovering
the
laws
of
planetary
movement
became
possible
only
when
people
gave
up
the
notion
that
the
earth
stands
still
after
the
battle
of
borodino
the
occupation
of
moscow
by
the
enemy
and
its
burning
historians
recognize
as
the
most
important
episode
of
the
war
of
1812
the
movement
of
the
russian
army
from
the
ryazan
to
the
kaluga
road
and
towards
the
tarutino
campthe
socalled
flanking
march
beyond
krasnaya
pakhra
historians
ascribe
the
glory
of
this
feat
of
genius
to
various
persons
and
argue
over
whom
it
essentially
belongs
to
even
foreign
even
french
historians
acknowledge
the
genius
of
the
russian
generals
when
they
speak
of
this
flanking
march
but
why
military
writers
and
everyone
else
after
them
suppose
this
flanking
march
which
saved
russia
and
destroyed
napoleon
to
be
the
most
profound
invention
of
some
one
personis
very
hard
to
understand
first
of
all
it
is
hard
to
understand
what
the
profundity
and
genius
of
this
movement
consisted
in
for
it
takes
no
great
mental
effort
to
figure
out
that
the
best
position
for
an
army
when
it
is
not
under
attack
is
where
there
are
most
provisions
and
anyone
even
a
stupid
thirteenyearold
boy
would
have
no
difficulty
figuring
out
that
the
most
advantageous
position
for
the
army
in
1812
after
the
retreat
from
moscow
was
on
the
kaluga
road
and
so
it
is
impossible
to
understand
first
by
what
reasonings
historians
come
to
see
anything
profound
in
this
maneuver
second
it
is
still
harder
to
understand
precisely
why
historians
see
this
maneuver
as
salutary
for
the
russians
and
destructive
for
the
french
for
this
flanking
march
under
other
preceding
accompanying
or
following
circumstances
could
have
been
destructive
for
the
russian
troops
and
salutary
for
the
french
if
from
the
time
this
movement
was
accomplished
the
position
of
the
russian
army
began
to
improve
it
by
no
means
follows
that
this
movement
was
the
cause
of
it
this
flanking
march
might
not
only
have
failed
to
produce
any
advantages
but
might
have
destroyed
the
russian
army
had
it
not
been
accompanied
by
a
coincidence
of
other
conditions
what
would
have
happened
if
moscow
had
not
burned
down
if
murat
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
russians
if
napoleon
had
not
remained
inactive
if
at
krasnaya
pakhra
the
russian
army
on
the
advice
of
bennigsen
and
barclay
had
offered
battle
what
would
have
happened
if
the
french
had
attacked
the
russians
as
they
moved
beyond
the
pakhra
what
would
have
happened
if
napoleon
later
coming
to
tarutino
had
attacked
the
russians
with
at
least
one
tenth
of
the
energy
with
which
he
had
attacked
at
smolensk
what
would
have
happened
if
the
french
had
marched
on
petersburgwith
all
these
suppositions
the
salutariness
of
the
flanking
march
might
have
turned
to
destruction
the
third
and
most
incomprehensible
thing
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
people
who
study
history
deliberately
refuse
to
see
that
the
flanking
march
cannot
possibly
be
ascribed
to
any
one
man
that
no
one
ever
foresaw
it
that
at
that
time
this
maneuver
just
like
the
retreat
from
fili
was
never
pictured
by
anyone
in
its
entirety
but
proceeded
step
by
step
event
by
event
moment
by
moment
from
a
countless
number
of
the
most
diverse
conditions
and
only
presented
itself
in
its
entirety
when
it
had
been
accomplished
and
become
past
at
the
council
in
fili
the
predominant
thought
of
the
russian
command
was
that
a
retreat
straight
back
that
is
down
the
nizhni
novgorod
road
went
without
saying
the
proofs
of
it
are
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
voices
at
the
council
voted
in
that
sense
and
above
all
the
wellknown
conversation
after
the
council
between
the
commander
in
chief
and
lanskoy
who
was
in
charge
of
provisions
lanskoy
reported
to
the
commander
in
chief
that
provender
for
the
army
was
collected
mainly
along
the
oka
in
tula
and
kaluga
provinces
and
that
in
case
of
a
retreat
towards
nizhni
the
supplies
of
provisions
would
be
separated
from
the
army
by
the
large
river
oka
transport
across
which
was
usually
impossible
at
the
beginning
of
winter
this
was
the
first
sign
of
the
need
to
deviate
from
heading
straight
for
nizhni
the
direction
which
had
previously
seemed
most
natural
the
army
kept
more
to
the
south
down
the
ryazan
road
and
closer
to
the
supplies
later
on
the
inactivity
of
the
french
who
had
even
lost
sight
of
the
russian
army
the
concern
with
defending
the
tula
factory
and
above
all
the
advantages
of
being
closer
to
the
supplies
made
the
army
deviate
still
further
to
the
south
to
the
tula
road
in
moving
to
the
tula
road
in
a
desperate
push
beyond
the
pakhra
the
commanders
of
the
russian
army
had
in
mind
staying
near
podolsk
and
there
was
no
thought
of
the
tarutino
position
but
a
countless
number
of
circumstances
and
the
reappearance
of
french
troops
who
had
previously
lost
sight
of
the
russians
and
the
plans
for
battle
and
above
all
the
abundance
of
provisions
in
kaluga
made
our
army
deviate
still
more
to
the
south
and
move
to
the
middle
of
its
supply
lines
from
the
tula
to
the
kaluga
road
to
tarutino
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
answer
the
question
of
when
moscow
was
abandoned
so
it
is
impossible
to
answer
precisely
when
and
by
whom
it
was
decided
to
move
to
tarutino
only
when
the
troops
had
already
reached
tarutino
owing
to
countless
differential
forces
only
then
did
people
begin
to
assure
themselves
that
they
had
wanted
it
and
had
long
foreseen
it
ii
the
famous
flanking
march
consisted
only
in
that
the
russian
army
retreating
straight
back
in
the
opposite
direction
of
its
advance
once
the
advance
of
the
french
stopped
deviated
from
the
straight
direction
it
had
first
followed
and
not
seeing
anyone
pursuing
it
naturally
tended
towards
the
side
it
was
drawn
to
by
the
abundance
of
provisions
if
we
picture
to
ourselves
not
commanders
of
genius
at
the
head
of
the
russian
army
but
simply
the
army
alone
without
any
leaders
that
army
could
not
have
done
anything
other
than
make
a
reverse
movement
towards
moscow
describing
an
arc
on
the
side
where
there
were
more
provisions
and
the
land
was
more
abundant
this
movement
from
the
nizhni
novgorod
to
the
ryazan
tula
and
kaluga
roads
was
so
natural
that
the
looters
of
the
russian
army
ran
back
in
that
same
direction
and
it
was
in
that
same
direction
that
demands
came
from
petersburg
for
kutuzov
to
move
his
army
in
tarutino
kutuzov
was
almost
reprimanded
by
the
sovereign
for
leading
the
army
to
the
ryazan
road
and
that
very
position
opposite
kaluga
was
pointed
out
to
him
which
he
was
already
in
when
he
received
the
sovereigns
letter
rolling
back
in
the
direction
of
the
push
given
it
during
the
whole
campaign
and
at
the
battle
of
borodino
the
ball
of
the
russian
army
with
the
exhaustion
of
the
force
of
the
push
and
not
receiving
any
new
pushes
assumed
the
position
that
was
natural
for
it
kutuzovs
merit
consisted
not
in
some
strategic
maneuver
of
genius
as
they
call
it
but
in
that
he
alone
understood
the
significance
of
what
was
happening
he
alone
already
understood
then
the
significance
of
the
french
armys
inactivity
he
alone
went
on
insisting
that
the
battle
of
borodino
had
been
a
victory
he
alonewho
it
would
seem
in
his
position
as
commander
in
chief
should
have
been
disposed
to
attackhe
alone
used
all
his
powers
to
keep
the
russian
army
from
useless
battles
the
beast
wounded
at
borodino
lay
there
where
the
fleeing
hunter
had
left
it
but
whether
it
was
alive
whether
it
was
strong
or
only
lying
low
the
hunter
did
not
know
suddenly
the
groaning
of
that
beast
was
heard
the
groaning
of
that
wounded
beast
the
french
army
which
betrayed
its
destruction
was
the
sending
of
lauriston
to
kutuzovs
camp
with
a
request
for
peace
napoleon
with
his
assurance
that
the
good
was
not
what
was
good
but
whatever
came
into
his
head
wrote
to
kutuzov
the
first
words
that
came
into
his
head
which
had
no
meaning
at
all
he
wrote

ma
nation
so
kutuzov
replied
and
he
went
on
using
all
his
powers
to
keep
the
troops
from
attacking
during
the
month
that
the
french
troops
were
looting
moscow
and
the
russian
troops
were
quietly
stationed
at
tarutino
a
change
took
place
in
the
relative
strength
of
the
two
armies
in
spirit
and
numbers
as
a
result
of
which
the
advantage
of
strength
turned
out
to
be
on
the
russian
side
though
the
position
of
the
french
troops
and
their
number
were
unknown
to
the
russians
as
soon
as
the
relations
changed
the
necessity
of
attacking
expressed
itself
at
once
in
a
countless
number
of
signs
these
signs
were
the
sending
of
lauriston
the
abundance
of
provisions
in
tarutino
the
information
coming
from
all
sides
about
the
inactivity
and
disorder
of
the
french
the
replenishing
of
our
regiments
with
recruits
the
good
weather
the
prolonged
rest
of
the
russian
soldiers
the
impatience
usually
resulting
from
rest
among
troops
to
do
what
they
had
all
been
brought
together
for
curiosity
about
what
was
happening
in
the
french
army
they
had
so
long
lost
sight
of
the
boldness
with
which
russian
outposts
now
poked
around
the
french
stationed
at
tarutino
the
news
of
easy
victories
of
the
peasants
and
partisans
over
the
french
the
envy
it
gave
rise
to
the
desire
for
revenge
that
lay
in
each
mans
soul
as
long
as
the
french
were
in
moscow
and
above
all
the
vague
awareness
which
emerged
in
the
soul
of
every
soldier
that
the
relations
of
strength
had
now
changed
and
the
advantage
was
now
on
our
side
the
essential
relations
of
strength
had
changed
and
it
became
necessary
to
attack
and
at
once
as
surely
as
a
clock
begins
to
strike
and
chime
as
soon
as
the
hand
makes
a
full
circle
so
this
essential
change
of
strength
was
correspondingly
reflected
in
higher
spheres
by
an
increased
movement
hissing
and
chiming
iii
the
russian
army
was
governed
by
kutuzov
and
his
staff
and
by
the
sovereign
from
petersburg
in
petersburg
before
the
news
of
the
abandoning
of
moscow
had
been
received
a
detailed
plan
for
the
whole
war
was
drawn
up
and
sent
to
kutuzov
for
his
guidance
despite
the
fact
that
this
plan
was
drawn
up
on
the
assumption
that
moscow
was
still
in
our
hands
it
was
approved
by
the
staff
and
accepted
for
carrying
out
kutuzov
wrote
only
that
it
is
always
difficult
to
carry
out
diversions
from
a
distance
and
in
order
to
resolve
the
emerging
difficulties
new
directives
and
persons
were
sent
whose
responsibility
it
was
to
follow
his
actions
and
report
on
them
besides
that
the
whole
staff
of
the
russian
army
was
now
transformed
bagration
who
had
been
killed
and
the
offended
barclay
who
had
withdrawn
were
replaced
quite
serious
reflection
was
given
to
which
would
be
better
to
put
a
in
bs
place
and
b
in
ds
place
or
on
the
contrary
d
in
as
place
and
so
on
as
if
anything
a
the
good
pleasure
of
a
and
b
could
depend
on
it
in
the
army
staff
because
of
the
enmity
between
kutuzov
and
his
chief
of
staff
bennigsen
and
the
presence
of
the
sovereigns
confidential
persons
and
these
replacements
a
more
than
usually
complex
play
of
parties
went
on
a
undermined
b
d
undermined
c
and
so
on
in
all
possible
transpositions
and
combinations
in
all
these
underminings
the
subject
of
the
intrigues
was
for
the
most
business
of
war
which
all
these
people
wanted
to
conduct
but
this
business
of
war
went
on
independently
of
them
precisely
as
it
had
to
go
on
that
is
never
coinciding
with
what
people
devised
but
proceeding
from
the
essential
correlation
of
the
masses
only
in
higher
spheres
were
all
these
devisings
crisscrossing
and
entangling
taken
as
a
faithful
reflection
of
what
ought
to
happen
the
sovereign
wrote
on
the
second
of
october
in
a
letter
received
only
after
the
battle
of
tarutino
prince
mikhail
ilarionovich
since
september
2nd
moscow
has
been
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
your
last
reports
are
from
the
20th
and
in
the
course
of
all
this
time
not
only
has
nothing
been
undertaken
for
action
against
the
enemy
and
the
deliverance
of
the
firstthroned
capital
but
according
to
your
latest
reports
you
have
retreated
even
further
back
serpukhov
is
already
occupied
by
an
enemy
detachment
and
tula
with
its
famous
factory
so
necessary
for
the
army
is
in
danger
by
the
reports
of
general
wintzingerode
i
see
that
an
enemy
corps
of
10000
men
is
moving
down
the
petersburg
road
another
of
several
thousand
men
is
also
heading
towards
dmitrov
a
third
has
moved
forward
on
the
vladimir
road
a
fourth
a
rather
considerable
one
is
stationed
between
ruza
and
mozhaisk
napoleon
himself
was
still
in
moscow
on
the
25th
in
the
light
of
all
these
reports
when
the
enemy
has
broken
up
his
forces
into
strong
detachments
when
napoleon
himself
is
still
in
moscow
with
his
guards
is
it
possible
that
the
enemy
forces
you
have
before
you
are
considerable
and
do
not
allow
you
to
go
on
the
offensive
in
all
probability
on
the
contrary
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
he
is
pursuing
you
with
detachments
or
at
most
a
corps
much
weaker
than
the
army
entrusted
to
you
it
would
seem
that
profiting
from
these
circumstances
you
could
with
advantage
attack
an
enemy
who
is
weaker
than
you
and
destroy
him
or
at
least
by
forcing
him
to
retreat
keep
in
our
hands
the
greater
the
provinces
now
occupied
by
the
enemy
and
thus
divert
the
danger
from
tula
and
our
other
towns
of
the
interior
it
will
remain
your
responsibility
if
the
enemy
is
in
a
position
to
detach
a
considerable
corps
for
petersburg
and
threaten
this
capital
in
which
not
many
troops
could
remain
for
with
the
army
entrusted
to
you
acting
resolutely
and
actively
you
have
all
the
means
to
prevent
this
new
misfortune
remember
that
you
still
owe
the
offended
fatherland
an
answer
for
the
loss
of
moscow
you
have
had
the
experience
of
my
readiness
to
reward
you
that
readiness
will
not
weaken
in
me
but
i
and
russia
have
the
right
to
expect
on
your
the
zeal
firmness
and
success
which
your
intelligence
your
military
talents
and
the
courage
of
the
troops
under
your
leadership
presage
for
us
but
by
the
time
this
letter
which
proved
that
the
essential
correlation
of
forces
was
already
reflected
in
petersburg
was
on
its
way
kutuzov
could
no
longer
keep
the
army
he
commanded
from
attacking
and
battle
had
already
been
offered
on
the
second
of
october
the
cossack
shapovalov
while
on
patrol
killed
one
hare
with
his
musket
and
wounded
another
pursuing
the
wounded
hare
shapovalov
wandered
deep
into
the
forest
and
ran
into
the
left
flank
of
murats
army
which
was
camped
there
without
any
precautions
the
cossack
laughing
told
his
friends
how
he
had
almost
been
captured
by
the
french
a
cornet
hearing
this
story
told
it
to
his
commander
the
cossack
was
summoned
questioned
the
cossack
commanders
wanted
to
use
the
occasion
to
capture
some
horses
but
one
of
their
superiors
who
had
acquaintances
among
the
upper
ranks
of
the
army
reported
this
fact
to
a
staff
general
lately
the
situation
in
the
army
staff
had
been
strained
to
the
utmost
ermolov
a
few
days
before
had
come
to
bennigsen
and
begged
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
commander
in
chief
to
make
him
go
on
the
offensive
if
i
didnt
know
you
id
think
you
dont
want
what
youre
asking
for
i
need
only
advise
something
for
his
serenity
to
be
sure
to
do
the
opposite
replied
bennigsen
the
news
of
the
cossacks
confirmed
by
patrols
that
were
sent
out
proved
that
the
event
had
finally
ripened
the
taut
string
jumped
the
clock
hissed
the
bells
chimed
despite
all
his
imaginary
power
his
intelligence
experience
and
knowledge
of
people
kutuzov
taking
into
consideration
the
note
from
bennigsen
who
sent
personal
reports
to
the
sovereign
the
same
wish
expressed
by
all
the
generals
the
supposed
wish
of
the
sovereign
and
the
information
of
the
cossacks
could
no
longer
hold
back
the
inevitable
movement
and
gave
the
order
to
do
that
which
he
considered
useless
and
harmfulhe
blessed
the
accomplished
fact
iv
the
note
submitted
by
bennigsen
about
the
necessity
to
attack
and
the
information
of
the
cossacks
about
the
exposed
left
flank
of
the
french
were
only
the
last
signs
of
the
necessity
to
order
the
attack
and
the
attack
was
fixed
for
the
fifth
of
october
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
october
kutuzov
signed
the
disposition
toll
read
it
to
ermolov
suggesting
that
he
should
occupy
himself
with
the
further
arrangements
very
well
very
well
i
have
no
time
now
said
ermolov
and
he
left
the
cottage
the
disposition
drawn
up
by
toll
was
very
good
as
in
the
austerlitz
disposition
it
was
written
though
not
in
german
die
erste
kolonne
marschiert
to
such
and
such
place
die
zweite
kolonne
marschiert
to
such
and
such
place
and
so
on
and
on
paper
all
these
columns
arrived
where
they
were
supposed
to
at
the
appointed
time
and
destroyed
the
enemy
as
in
all
dispositions
everything
was
beautifully
thought
out
and
as
with
all
dispositions
not
a
single
column
arrived
where
it
was
supposed
to
at
the
appointed
time
when
the
disposition
had
been
prepared
in
the
proper
number
of
copies
an
officer
was
summoned
and
sent
to
ermolov
to
hand
him
the
papers
for
execution
the
young
officer
of
the
horse
guards
kutuzovs
orderly
pleased
with
the
importance
of
the
mission
given
to
him
went
to
ermolovs
quarters
he
left
said
ermolovs
orderly
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
went
to
a
general
whom
ermolov
frequented
no
and
the
generals
not
here
either
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
mounted
up
and
rode
to
yet
another
no
he
left
i
hope
i
wont
have
to
answer
for
the
delay
how
vexing
thought
the
officer
he
rode
around
the
whole
camp
this
one
said
ermolov
had
been
seen
riding
somewhere
with
some
other
generals
that
one
said
he
must
have
gone
back
home
the
officer
went
without
dinner
and
searched
until
six
oclock
in
the
evening
ermolov
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
nobody
knew
where
he
was
the
officer
had
a
quick
bite
with
a
comrade
and
went
back
to
miloradovich
in
the
vanguard
miloradovich
was
also
not
at
home
but
here
he
was
told
that
miloradovich
was
at
general
kikins
ball
and
that
ermolov
must
be
there
too
and
where
is
that
over
there
in
yechkino
said
the
cossack
officer
pointing
to
a
distant
manor
house
how
can
it
be
beyond
the
line
they
sent
two
of
our
regiments
to
the
line
theres
such
carousing
going
on
there
now
its
awful
two
bands
three
choruses
of
singers
the
officer
rode
beyond
the
line
to
yechkino
from
a
distance
as
he
approached
the
house
he
could
already
hear
the
merry
concerted
sounds
of
a
soldiers
dancing
song
inthemeeeadowsinthemeeeadows
he
heard
with
whistling
and
a
torban
occasionally
overwhelmed
by
the
shouting
of
voices
the
officer
felt
cheered
by
these
sounds
but
at
the
same
time
afraid
of
being
blamed
for
taking
so
long
to
convey
the
important
order
he
had
been
entrusted
with
it
was
already
past
eight
oclock
he
dismounted
and
went
up
the
porch
and
into
the
front
hall
of
a
big
intact
landowners
mansion
that
stood
between
the
russians
and
the
french
in
the
pantry
and
the
front
hall
servants
bustled
about
with
wines
and
food
the
singers
stood
by
the
windows
the
officer
was
led
through
the
door
and
he
suddenly
saw
the
most
important
generals
of
the
army
all
together
among
them
the
large
conspicuous
figure
of
ermolov
the
generals
were
all
standing
in
a
semicircle
their
tunics
unbuttoned
their
faces
red
and
animated
laughing
loudly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
handsome
short
redfaced
general
was
briskly
and
deftly
dancing
the
trepak
ha
ha
ha
go
to

nikolai
ivanovich

ha

the
officer
felt
that
coming
in
just
then
with
an
important
order
he
was
doubly
to
blame
and
he
wanted
to
wait
but
one
of
the
generals
saw
him
and
learning
why
he
had
come
told
ermolov
ermolov
with
a
frowning
face
came
over
to
the
officer
and
having
heard
him
out
took
the
paper
from
him
without
saying
anything
you
think
he
left
by
chance
a
comrade
from
the
staff
said
that
evening
to
the
officer
of
the
horse
guards
about
ermolov
its
a
trick
it
was
all
on
purpose
to
undercut
konovnitsyn
youll
see
what
a
hash
therell
be
tomorrow
v
early
the
next
morning
the
decrepit
old
kutuzov
got
up
said
his
prayers
dressed
and
with
the
unpleasant
awareness
that
he
had
to
lead
a
battle
of
which
he
did
not
approve
got
into
a
caleche
and
drove
out
of
letashevka
three
miles
behind
tarutino
to
the
place
where
the
attacking
columns
were
to
assemble
kutuzov
rode
along
falling
asleep
and
waking
up
and
trying
to
hear
if
there
was
gunfire
to
the
right
if
the
action
had
begun
but
everything
was
still
quiet
a
damp
and
overcast
autumnal
day
was
beginning
to
dawn
approaching
tarutino
kutuzov
noticed
some
cavalrymen
who
were
taking
their
horses
to
water
across
the
road
on
which
his
caleche
was
driving
kutuzov
looked
at
them
closely
stopped
the
caleche
and
asked
what
regiment
they
were
from
the
cavalrymen
were
from
a
column
that
should
have
been
waiting
in
ambush
far
ahead
an
error
maybe
the
old
commander
in
chief
thought
but
having
driven
further
kutuzov
saw
infantry
regiments
their
muskets
stacked
the
soldiers
in
their
underdrawers
eating
kasha
and
toting
firewood
an
officer
was
sent
for
the
officer
reported
that
there
had
been
no
order
to
advance
hows
that
no
or
kutuzov
began
but
fell
silent
at
once
and
ordered
the
senior
officer
to
be
sent
to
him
getting
out
of
the
caleche
his
head
lowered
and
breathing
hard
he
paced
up
and
down
waiting
silently
when
eichen
the
summoned
officer
of
the
general
staff
appeared
kutuzov
turned
purple
not
because
this
officer
was
guilty
of
an
error
but
because
he
was
a
worthy
object
for
the
expression
of
anger
and
shaking
choking
getting
into
that
state
of
fury
in
which
he
was
capable
of
rolling
on
the
ground
from
wrath
the
old
man
fell
upon
eichen
making
threatening
gestures
shouting
and
swearing
in
foul
language
another
man
who
happened
to
turn
up
captain
brozin
suffered
the
same
fate
though
he
was
not
guilty
of
anything
who
is
this
other
swine
shoot
the
scoundrels
he
cried
hoarsely
waving
his
arms
and
reeling
he
was
suffering
physically
he
the
commander
in
chief
his
serenity
who
was
assured
by
everyone
that
no
one
in
russia
had
ever
had
such
power
as
he
had
been
put
in
such
a
positionheld
up
to
mockery
before
the
entire
army
i
bothered
praying
like
that
for
the
coming
day
i
spent
a
sleepless
night
thinking
it
all
overfor
nothing
he
thought
to
himself
when
i
was
a
young
brat
of
an
officer
nobody
dared
to
laugh
at
me
like
thisbut
now
he
was
suffering
physically
as
if
from
corporal
punishment
and
could
not
help
expressing
it
with
wrathful
and
painful
cries
but
his
strength
soon
began
to
fail
and
looking
around
feeling
that
he
had
said
a
lot
of
bad
things
he
got
into
his
caleche
and
silently
drove
back
again
the
wrath
he
had
poured
out
did
not
return
and
kutuzov
blinking
weakly
heard
out
the
justifications
and
words
of
defense
ermolov
himself
did
not
come
to
him
until
the
next
day
and
the
insistences
of
bennigsen
konovnitsyn
and
toll
that
the
same
miscarried
movement
could
be
done
the
next
day
and
kutuzov
again
had
to
agree
vi
the
next
day
the
troops
assembled
in
the
appointed
places
in
the
evening
and
advanced
during
the
night
it
was
an
autumnal
night
with
purplish
black
clouds
but
without
rain
the
ground
was
damp
but
there
was
no
mud
and
the
troops
walked
noiselessly
only
occasionally
the
clank
of
artillery
could
be
faintly
heard
loud
talk
pipe
smoking
and
striking
a
fire
were
forbidden
the
horses
were
kept
from
neighing
the
secrecy
of
the
undertaking
increased
its
attractiveness
the
men
marched
cheerfully
some
columns
halted
stacked
their
muskets
and
lay
down
on
the
cold
ground
assuming
they
had
gotten
where
they
were
supposed
to
go
some
columns
the
majority
marched
all
night
and
obviously
did
not
get
where
they
were
supposed
to
go
count
orlovdenisov
with
his
cossacks
the
most
insignificant
detachment
of
them
all
was
the
only
one
who
ended
up
in
the
right
place
and
at
the
right
time
this
detachment
halted
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
a
path
led
from
the
village
of
stromilovo
to
dmitrovskoe
before
dawn
the
dozing
count
orlov
was
awakened
a
deserter
from
the
french
camp
was
brought
to
him
he
was
a
polish
sergeant
from
poniatowskis
corps
the
sergeant
explained
in
polish
that
he
had
deserted
because
he
had
been
passed
over
in
the
service
that
he
should
have
been
a
commissioned
officer
long
ago
that
he
was
braver
than
all
of
them
and
therefore
he
had
left
them
and
wanted
to
punish
them
he
said
that
murat
was
spending
the
night
a
mile
away
and
that
if
they
gave
him
a
hundredman
escort
he
would
take
him
alive
count
orlovdenisov
consulted
with
his
comrades
the
offer
was
too
tempting
to
refuse
everyone
volunteered
to
go
everyone
advised
making
the
attempt
after
much
arguing
and
considering
major
general
grekov
with
two
cossack
regiments
decided
to
go
with
the
sergeant
but
remember
said
count
orlovdenisov
as
he
dismissed
the
sergeant
if
youre
lying
ill
have
you
hung
like
a
dog
but
if
its
true
youll
get
a
hundred
gold
pieces
not
replying
to
these
words
the
officer
mounted
his
horse
with
a
resolute
air
and
rode
off
with
the
quickly
prepared
grekov
they
disappeared
into
the
forest
count
orlov
shivering
from
the
chill
of
early
dawn
excited
by
what
he
had
undertaken
on
his
own
responsibility
having
seen
grekov
off
came
out
of
the
forest
and
began
to
study
the
enemy
camp
which
was
now
visible
in
the
deceptive
light
of
early
morning
and
the
dying
campfires
our
columns
were
to
appear
to
the
right
of
count
orlovdenisov
on
the
open
hillside
count
orlov
looked
that
way
but
though
these
columns
would
have
been
visible
from
far
off
they
were
nowhere
in
sight
it
seemed
to
count
orlovdenisov
and
especially
to
his
very
keensighted
adjutant
that
the
french
camp
was
beginning
to
stir
ah
it
really
is
late
said
count
orlov
glancing
at
the
camp
as
often
happens
once
the
person
we
have
believed
is
no
longer
before
our
eyes
it
suddenly
became
perfectly
clear
and
obvious
to
him
that
this
sergeant
was
a
fraud
that
he
had
lied
to
them
and
would
only
spoil
the
whole
business
of
the
attack
by
the
absence
of
those
two
regiments
which
he
would
lead
god
knows
where
how
could
anyone
snatch
a
commander
in
chief
out
of
such
a
mass
of
troops
he
really
lied
the
rogue
said
the
count
they
can
be
called
back
said
someone
from
his
suite
who
like
count
orlovdenisov
felt
mistrustful
of
the
undertaking
when
he
looked
at
the
camp
ah
reallywhat
do
you
think
shall
we
leave
it
as
is
or
not
do
you
order
them
called
back
call
them
back
call
them
back
count
orlov
suddenly
said
resolutely
looking
at
his
watch
it
will
be
too
late
its
quite
light
and
an
adjutant
galloped
into
the
forest
after
grekov
when
grekov
came
back
count
orlovdenisov
upset
by
this
cancelled
attempt
and
by
the
vain
wait
for
the
infantry
columns
which
were
not
yet
in
sight
and
by
the
proximity
of
the
enemy
all
the
men
of
his
detachment
experienced
the
same
thing
decided
to
attack
he
whispered
the
command
mount
they
formed
up
they
crossed
themselves
god
be
with
you
hurrrah
rang
out
through
the
forest
and
one
by
one
as
if
pouring
from
a
sack
hundreds
of
cossacks
their
lances
atilt
flew
merrily
across
the
brook
towards
the
camp
one
desperate
frightened
cry
of
the
first
frenchman
to
see
the
cossacksand
all
who
were
in
the
camp
undressed
halfawake
abandoned
cannon
muskets
horses
and
ran
off
wherever
they
could
if
the
cossacks
had
pursued
the
french
paying
no
attention
to
what
was
behind
and
around
them
they
would
have
taken
both
murat
and
everything
that
was
there
the
officers
wanted
that
but
once
the
cossacks
got
hold
of
the
booty
and
the
prisoners
they
would
not
budge
no
one
obeyed
orders
fifteen
hundred
prisoners
thirtyeight
cannon
standards
and
what
was
most
important
for
the
cossacks
horses
saddles
blankets
and
various
objects
were
taken
on
the
spot
all
that
had
to
be
managed
the
prisoners
and
cannon
had
to
be
taken
in
hand
the
booty
divided
with
shouting
and
even
fighting
among
themselves
the
cossacks
were
taken
up
with
all
that
the
french
no
longer
pursued
gradually
began
to
recover
formed
units
and
started
shooting
orlovdenisov
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
columns
and
did
not
advance
further
meanwhile
according
to
the
dispositiondie
erste
kolonne
marschiert
and
so
onthe
infantry
of
the
belated
columns
commanded
by
bennigsen
and
directed
by
toll
started
out
properly
and
as
always
happens
got
somewhere
but
not
where
they
were
supposed
to
go
as
always
happens
the
men
who
had
started
out
cheerfully
began
to
halt
displeasure
was
voiced
confusion
was
sensed
they
began
moving
back
somewhere
adjutants
and
generals
galloped
about
shouted
became
angry
quarreled
said
they
had
come
to
the
wrong
place
and
were
late
denounced
somebody
and
so
on
and
finally
they
all
waved
their
hands
and
went
on
only
so
as
to
go
somewhere
well
get
somewhere
and
indeed
they
did
but
not
to
the
right
place
though
some
also
got
to
the
right
place
but
so
late
that
they
were
of
no
use
and
only
got
themselves
shot
at
toll
who
in
this
battle
played
the
role
of
weyrother
at
austerlitz
galloped
assiduously
from
place
to
place
and
everywhere
found
things
the
wrong
way
round
thus
he
ran
into
bagovuts
corps
in
the
forest
when
it
was
already
quite
light
and
that
corps
was
supposed
to
have
long
been
with
orlovdenisov
agitated
upset
by
the
failure
and
supposing
that
someone
was
to
blame
for
it
toll
rode
up
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
and
began
to
upbraid
him
sternly
saying
he
ought
to
be
shot
for
it
bagovut
an
old
calm
seasoned
general
also
worn
out
by
all
those
halts
confusions
contradictions
to
everyones
surprise
completely
contrary
to
his
character
flew
into
a
rage
and
said
all
sorts
of
unpleasant
things
to
toll
im
not
going
to
take
lessons
from
anybody
and
i
can
die
with
my
soldiers
no
worse
than
anybody
else
he
said
and
marched
on
with
a
single
division
coming
out
into
the
field
under
french
fire
the
agitated
and
brave
bagovut
without
considering
whether
his
going
into
action
now
and
with
only
one
division
was
useful
or
useless
marched
straight
ahead
and
led
his
troops
under
fire
danger
cannonballs
bullets
were
what
he
needed
in
his
wrathful
state
one
of
the
first
bullets
killed
him
the
bullets
that
followed
killed
many
of
his
soldiers
and
for
some
time
his
division
went
on
standing
uselessly
under
fire
vii
meanwhile
another
column
was
supposed
to
attack
the
french
on
the
front
but
kutuzov
was
with
that
column
he
knew
very
well
that
nothing
but
confusion
would
come
of
this
battle
begun
against
his
will
and
as
far
as
was
in
his
power
tried
to
hold
back
the
troops
he
did
not
move
kutuzov
rode
along
silently
on
his
little
gray
horse
lazily
responding
to
the
suggestions
to
attack
youve
got
attack
on
your
tongue
all
the
time
and
dont
see
that
we
cant
perform
complicated
maneuvers
he
said
to
miloradovich
who
was
asking
to
advance
we
were
unable
to
take
murat
alive
this
morning
and
get
in
place
on
time
now
theres
nothing
to
do
he
replied
to
another
when
word
came
to
kutuzov
that
in
the
french
rear
where
according
to
a
cossack
report
there
had
previously
been
no
one
there
were
now
two
battalions
of
poles
he
glanced
sidelong
at
ermolov
behind
him
he
had
not
spoken
to
him
since
the
previous
day
here
theyre
asking
to
go
on
the
offensive
suggest
several
plans
but
we
barely
get
down
to
business
and
nothings
ready
and
the
alerted
enemy
takes
his
measures
ermolov
narrowed
his
eyes
and
smiled
slightly
hearing
these
words
he
understood
that
the
storm
was
over
for
him
and
that
kutuzov
would
limit
himself
to
this
hint
hes
having
fun
at
my
expense
ermolov
said
softly
nudging
raevsky
who
was
standing
next
to
him
with
his
knee
soon
after
that
ermolov
stepped
up
to
kutuzov
and
reported
respectfully
theres
still
time
your
serenity
the
enemy
hasnt
gone
away
yet
what
if
you
order
an
offensive
otherwise
the
guards
wont
see
any
smoke
kutuzov
said
nothing
but
when
it
was
reported
to
him
that
murats
troops
were
retreating
he
ordered
an
offensive
but
at
every
hundred
paces
he
halted
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
the
whole
battle
consisted
in
what
orlovdenisovs
cossacks
had
done
the
rest
of
the
troops
merely
lost
several
hundred
men
for
nothing
as
a
result
of
this
battle
kutuzov
received
a
diamond
decoration
bennigsen
also
got
diamonds
and
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
others
according
to
their
rank
also
received
many
pleasant
things
and
after
this
battle
there
were
more
new
transfers
in
the
staff
thats
how
its
always
done
with
us
all
the
wrong
way
round
the
russian
officers
and
generals
said
after
the
battle
of
tarutino
just
as
people
speak
now
letting
it
be
felt
that
some
fool
somewhere
does
things
that
way
the
wrong
way
round
but
we
would
not
do
things
that
way
but
people
who
talk
like
that
either
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
or
are
deliberately
deceiving
themselves
no
battletarutino
borodino
austerlitzcomes
off
the
way
its
organizers
supposed
that
is
an
essential
condition
a
countless
number
of
free
forces
for
nowhere
is
a
man
more
free
than
in
a
battle
where
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
influence
the
direction
of
the
battle
and
that
direction
can
never
be
known
beforehand
and
never
coincides
with
the
direction
of
some
one
force
if
many
simultaneous
and
variously
directed
forces
act
upon
some
body
the
direction
of
that
bodys
movement
cannot
coincide
with
any
one
of
those
forces
there
will
always
be
the
shortest
median
direction
which
in
mechanics
is
expressed
by
the
diagonal
of
the
parallelogram
of
forces
if
in
the
descriptions
of
historians
french
historians
in
particular
we
find
that
their
wars
and
battles
were
carried
out
according
to
a
predetermined
plan
the
only
conclusion
we
can
draw
from
that
is
that
these
descriptions
are
not
correct
the
battle
of
tarutino
obviously
did
not
achieve
the
purpose
toll
had
in
mind
of
sending
troops
into
action
in
good
order
according
to
the
disposition
nor
the
one
orlov
might
have
had
of
capturing
murat
nor
the
goal
of
the
instantaneous
extermination
of
an
entire
corps
which
bennigsen
and
other
persons
may
have
had
nor
the
goal
of
the
officer
who
wanted
to
go
into
action
and
distinguish
himself
nor
of
the
cossack
who
would
have
liked
to
get
more
booty
than
he
did
and
so
on
but
if
the
goal
was
that
which
actually
took
place
and
that
which
was
then
the
general
wish
of
all
russian
people
to
drive
the
french
out
of
russia
and
exterminate
their
army
then
it
will
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
battle
of
tarutino
precisely
owing
to
its
incoherencies
was
the
very
thing
that
was
needed
at
that
period
of
the
campaign
it
would
be
difficult
and
even
impossible
to
think
up
any
outcome
of
the
battle
more
expedient
than
the
one
it
had
with
the
least
strain
with
the
greatest
confusion
and
with
the
most
insignificant
losses
the
greatest
results
of
the
whole
campaign
were
achieved
the
transition
was
made
from
retreat
to
offense
the
weakness
of
the
french
was
exposed
and
the
push
was
given
which
napoleons
army
was
only
waiting
for
to
begin
its
flight
viii
napoleon
enters
moscow
after
the
brilliant
victory
de
la
moskowa
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
victory
since
the
battlefield
remains
with
the
french
the
russians
retreat
and
surrender
the
capital
moscow
filled
with
provisions
arms
ammunition
and
incalculable
riches
is
in
the
hands
of
napoleon
the
russian
army
twice
weaker
than
the
french
does
not
make
a
single
attempt
to
attack
in
the
course
of
a
month
napoleons
position
is
most
brilliant
to
fall
upon
the
remainder
of
the
russian
army
with
double
its
forces
and
exterminate
it
to
negotiate
an
advantageous
peace
or
in
case
of
refusal
to
make
a
threatening
move
on
petersburg
even
to
return
to
smolensk
or
vilno
in
case
of
failure
or
to
remain
in
moscowin
other
words
to
hold
on
to
the
brilliant
position
the
french
army
was
in
at
the
time
would
seem
to
require
no
special
genius
for
that
one
needed
to
do
the
simplest
and
easiest
thing
to
keep
the
army
from
looting
to
provide
a
supply
of
winter
clothing
of
which
there
would
be
enough
in
moscow
for
the
whole
army
and
to
organize
the
collection
of
provisions
for
the
whole
army
of
which
on
the
evidence
of
french
historians
there
were
enough
in
moscow
for
more
than
six
months
napoleon
that
genius
of
geniuses
and
having
the
power
of
control
over
the
army
as
the
historians
affirm
did
none
of
that
he
not
only
did
none
of
it
but
on
the
contrary
he
used
his
power
in
order
to
choose
out
of
all
the
paths
of
action
presented
to
him
the
one
which
was
the
most
stupid
and
destructive
of
all
that
napoleon
might
have
done
to
winter
in
moscow
to
go
against
petersburg
to
go
against
nizhni
novgorod
to
go
back
more
to
the
north
or
to
the
south
the
way
kutuzov
went
laterwhatever
one
thinks
up
nothing
stupider
or
more
destructive
than
what
napoleon
did
that
is
to
stay
in
moscow
until
october
to
allow
his
troops
to
loot
the
city
then
hesitating
whether
or
not
to
leave
a
garrison
to
quit
moscow
to
approach
kutuzov
without
starting
a
battle
to
turn
to
the
right
reach
maly
yaroslavets
again
without
trying
his
chances
of
breaking
through
to
go
not
by
the
road
kutuzov
had
taken
but
back
to
mozhaisk
down
the
devastated
smolensk
roadnothing
stupider
than
that
or
more
destructive
for
his
troops
could
possibly
have
been
thought
up
as
the
consequences
showed
let
the
most
skillful
of
strategists
imagining
that
napoleons
goal
was
to
destroy
his
army
think
up
another
series
of
actions
which
would
as
unquestionably
and
as
independently
of
anything
the
russian
troops
might
have
undertaken
destroy
the
whole
french
army
so
completely
as
what
napoleon
did
napoleon
the
genius
did
that
but
to
say
that
napoleon
destroyed
his
army
because
he
wanted
to
or
because
he
was
very
stupid
would
be
just
as
unfair
as
to
say
that
napoleon
brought
his
army
as
far
as
moscow
because
he
wanted
to
and
because
he
was
very
intelligent
and
a
genius
in
either
case
his
personal
activity
having
no
more
power
than
the
personal
activity
of
each
soldier
merely
coincided
with
the
laws
according
to
which
the
phenomenon
was
accomplished
historians
quite
falsely
only
because
what
followed
did
not
justify
his
actions
describe
for
us
the
weakening
of
napoleons
powers
in
moscow
just
as
earlier
and
also
later
in
the
year
thirteen
he
employed
all
his
skill
and
powers
to
do
the
best
for
himself
and
his
army
napoleons
activity
during
this
time
was
no
less
astounding
than
it
was
in
egypt
in
italy
in
austria
and
in
prussia
we
do
not
know
for
certain
how
great
napoleons
genius
really
was
in
egypt
where
forty
centuries
looked
down
upon
his
greatness
because
all
his
great
deeds
are
described
for
us
only
by
the
french
we
cannot
correctly
judge
his
genius
in
austria
and
prussia
because
information
about
his
activity
there
must
be
drawn
from
french
and
german
sources
and
the
incomprehensible
surrender
into
captivity
of
whole
corps
without
a
battle
and
of
fortresses
without
a
siege
was
bound
to
incline
the
germans
towards
recognizing
his
genius
as
the
sole
explanation
of
the
war
that
was
conducted
in
germany
but
we
thank
god
have
no
reason
to
recognize
his
genius
in
order
to
cover
up
our
shame
we
paid
for
the
right
to
look
at
the
matter
simply
and
directly
and
we
shall
not
give
up
that
right
his
activity
in
moscow
is
as
astounding
and
marked
by
genius
as
everywhere
else
order
after
order
and
plan
after
plan
proceed
from
him
from
the
time
of
his
entry
into
moscow
until
he
leaves
it
the
absence
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
deputation
and
the
burning
of
moscow
itself
do
not
throw
him
off
he
does
not
lose
sight
either
of
the
welfare
of
his
army
or
of
the
doings
of
the
enemy
or
of
the
welfare
of
the
peoples
of

or
of
the
management
of
affairs
in

or
of
diplomatic
considerations

in

de

concerning

thiers

that
the

not

to

nothing

the

only
went
towards
fulfilling
the

the

should
be
blown
upthat
is
that
the
floor
against

the

hurt

should
be
given
a

the
pursuit
of
the
russian

which
so
preoccupied
napoleon
produced
an
unheardof
phenomenon
the
french
generals
lost
the
sixtythousandman
russian

and
in
thierss
words
it
was
only
owing
to
the

and
it

the

that
they
managed
to
find

this

there
were
no

caught

ventured

afield

the

failed
in
exactly
the

way
the
theaters
set
up
in
the
kremlin

in

closed
at
once

the
actresses

were

moscow

had
no

there
was

for

not
only
did
the
counterfeit
notes
that
napoleon
so
graciously
distributed
have
no
value
but
silver
was
exchanged
at
below
value
for
gold
but
the
most
striking
manifestation
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
orders
from
above
at
that
time
came
from
napoleons
attempts
to
put

the
emperor
is
extremely
displeased
that
despite
strict
orders
to
put
an
end
to
looting
all
we
see
is
detachments
of
marauding
guards
coming
back
to
the
kremlin
disorder
and
looting
were
renewed
worse
than
ever
among
the
old
guard
yesterday
last
night
and
today
the
emperor
regrets
to
see
that
the
picked
soldiers
appointed
to
protect
his
person
and
supposed
to
give
an
example
of
subordination
push
their
disobedience
to
such
a
degree
that
they
break
into
the
cellars
and
storerooms
reserved
for
the
army
others
have
lowered
themselves
so
far
as
to
disobey
sentries
and
guards

and
beating

this
army
like
a
herd
let
loose
trampling
underfoot
the
fodder
that
might
save
it
from
starvation
was
falling
a
perishing
with
every
extra
day
it
spent
in
moscow
yet
it
did
not
budge
it
began
to
flee
only
when
it
was
suddenly
seized
by
panic
fear
caused
by
the
interception
of
its
supply
trains
on
the
smolensk
road
and
by
the
battle
of
tarutino
this
same
news
of
the
battle
of
tarutino
which
napoleon
received
unexpectedly
during
a
review
aroused
in
him
a
desire
to
punish
the
russians
as
thiers
says
and
he
gave
orders
for
departure
which
was
what
the
whole
army
was
demanding
fleeing
from
moscow
the
men
of
this
army
took
along
everything
they
had
looted
napoleon
also
carted
his
own
personal
tr233sor
with
him
seeing
the
baggage
train
that
encumbered
the
army
napoleon
was
horrified
as
thiers
says
but
for
all
his
experience
of
war
he
did
not
order
the
burning
of
all
superfluous
wagons
as
he
had
done
with
the
wagons
of
a
certain
marshal
when
approaching
moscow
but
looked
at
the
caleches
and
carriages
in
which
the
soldiers
were
riding
and
said
that
it
was
very
good
that
these
vehicles
would
be
used
for
provisions
the
sick
and
the
wounded
the
plight
of
the
whole
army
was
like
the
plight
of
a
wounded
animal
that
feels
itself
perishing
and
does
not
know
what
it
is
doing
to
study
the
skillful
maneuvers
and
aims
of
napoleon
and
his
army
from
the
moment
of
his
entry
into
moscow
until
the
destruction
of
that
army
is
the
same
as
studying
the
meaning
of
the
dying
leaps
and
convulsions
of
a
mortally
wounded
animal
very
often
a
wounded
animal
hearing
a
rustle
rushes
towards
the
hunters
shot
runs
forward
then
back
and
hastens
its
own
end
that
was
what
napoleon
was
doing
under
the
pressure
of
his
whole
army
the
rustle
of
the
battle
of
tarutino
frightened
the
beast
and
it
rushed
ahead
towards
the
shot
ran
as
far
as
the
hunter
turned
back
then
ahead
then
back
again
and
finally
like
any
beast
ran
back
over
its
old
familiar
tracksthat
is
over
the
most
disadvantageous
and
dangerous
path
for
it
napoleon
whom
we
imagine
as
guiding
this
whole
movement
as
a
savage
imagines
that
the
figure
carved
on
the
prow
of
a
ship
is
the
force
that
guides
it
napoleon
during
all
this
time
of
his
activity
was
like
a
child
who
holding
the
straps
tied
inside
a
carriage
fancies
that
he
is
driving
it
xi
on
the
sixth
of
october
early
in
the
morning
pierre
stepped
out
of
the
shed
and
on
his
way
back
stopped
by
the
door
playing
with
a
long
purplish
dog
on
short
bowed
legs
that
was
fidgeting
around
him
this
dog
lived
in
their
shed
spending
the
nights
with
karataev
but
occasionally
went
to
town
somewhere
and
came
back
again
it
had
probably
never
belonged
to
anyone
and
now
too
it
was
no
ones
and
had
no
name
at
all
the
french
called
it
azor
the
storytelling
soldier
called
it
femgalka
karataev
and
the
others
sometimes
called
it
gray
sometimes
floppy
its
not
belonging
to
anyone
and
the
absence
of
a
name
and
even
of
a
breed
even
of
a
definite
color
seemed
not
to
bother
the
purplish
dog
in
the
least
its
fluffy
tail
stood
up
firm
and
rounded
like
a
panache
its
bowed
legs
served
it
so
well
that
often
as
if
scorning
to
use
all
four
legs
it
raised
one
gracefully
and
ran
very
deftly
and
quickly
on
three
everything
was
an
object
of
pleasure
for
it
now
it
lolled
on
its
back
squealing
with
joy
now
it
warmed
itself
in
the
sun
with
a
pensive
and
meaningful
look
now
it
frolicked
playing
with
a
wood
chip
or
a
straw
pierres
clothing
now
consisted
of
a
dirty
tattered
shirt
the
only
remains
of
his
former
attire
a
soldiers
trousers
tied
with
string
at
the
ankles
for
the
sake
of
warmth
on
karataevs
advice
a
kaftan
and
a
muzhiks
hat
physically
pierre
had
changed
very
much
during
that
time
he
no
longer
seemed
fat
though
he
had
the
same
look
of
massiveness
and
strength
that
was
hereditary
to
his
breed
the
lower
his
face
was
overgrown
with
a
beard
and
mustache
his
hair
grown
long
and
full
of
lice
now
formed
a
tangled
curly
cap
there
was
firmness
calm
and
a
lively
readiness
in
the
expression
of
his
eyes
such
as
had
never
been
there
before
his
former
laxness
expressed
even
in
his
gaze
was
now
replaced
by
an
energetic
composure
ready
for
action
and
resistance
his
feet
were
bare
pierre
now
looked
down
across
the
field
over
which
wagons
and
horsemen
were
moving
about
that
morning
now
into
the
distance
beyond
the
river
now
at
the
dog
who
pretended
that
she
was
going
to
bite
him
in
earnest
now
at
his
bare
feet
which
he
took
pleasure
in
shifting
into
different
positions
moving
his
dirty
fat
big
toes
and
each
time
he
looked
at
his
bare
feet
a
lively
and
selfsatisfied
smile
passed
over
his
face
the
sight
of
those
bare
feet
reminded
him
of
all
he
had
lived
through
and
understood
during
that
time
and
he
found
that
remembrance
pleasant
for
several
days
already
the
weather
had
been
calm
clear
with
a
light
frost
in
the
morningssocalled
indian
summer
the
air
was
warm
in
the
sun
and
that
warmth
along
with
the
invigorating
freshness
of
the
morning
frost
still
felt
in
the
air
was
especially
pleasant
on
all
things
far
and
near
there
was
that
magically
crystalline
sheen
which
occurs
only
at
that
time
of
autumn
in
the
distance
he
could
see
the
sparrow
hills
with
the
village
the
church
and
a
large
white
house
the
bared
trees
and
the
sand
and
the
stones
and
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
the
green
spire
of
the
church
and
the
angles
of
the
distant
white
houseall
this
was
etched
with
unnatural
distinctness
with
the
finest
lines
in
the
transparent
air
nearby
he
could
see
the
familiar
ruins
of
a
halfburnt
manor
house
occupied
by
the
french
with
still
dark
green
lilac
bushes
growing
along
the
fence
and
even
that
ruined
and
befouled
house
repulsively
ugly
in
overcast
weather
now
in
the
bright
immobile
brilliance
seemed
something
soothingly
beautiful
a
french
corporal
unbuttoned
in
a
homey
way
in
a
nightcap
with
a
short
pipe
in
his
teeth
came
around
the
corner
of
the
shed
and
with
a
friendly
wink
approached
pierre
quel
soleil
hein
monsieur
kiril
so
all
the
frenchmen
called
pierre
on
dirait
le
printemps
and
the
corporal
leaned
against
the
door
and
offered
pierre
a
pipe
despite
the
fact
that
he
always
offered
it
and
pierre
always
refused
it
si
lon
marchait
par
un
temps
comme
celuil224
he
began
pierre
asked
him
what
he
had
heard
about
the
departure
and
the
corporal
told
him
that
almost
all
the
troops
were
leaving
and
that
an
order
should
come
presently
about
the
prisoners
in
the
shed
where
pierre
was
one
of
the
soldiers
sokolov
was
sick
and
dying
and
pierre
told
the
corporal
that
this
soldier
should
be
looked
after
the
corporal
said
that
pierre
could
rest
assured
that
there
were
ambulant
and
stationary
hospitals
for
that
and
there
would
be
an
order
about
the
sick
and
generally
whatever
might
happen
had
all
been
foreseen
by
the
superiors

the
captain
the
corporal
was
referring
to
conversed
with
pierre
frequently
and
at
length
and
was
indulgent
towards
him
in
various
ways

and
having
chatted
a
while
longer
the
corporal
left
the
business
the
corporal
referred
to
which
had
happened
the
other
day
was
a
fight
between
the
prisoners
and
the
french
in
which
pierre
had
managed
to
pacify
his
comrades
several
prisoners
had
listened
to
pierres
talk
with
the
corporal
and
at
once
began
asking
what
he
had
said
while
pierre
was
telling
his
comrades
what
the
corporal
had
said
about
the
departure
a
skinny
yellow
ragged
french
soldier
came
to
the
door
of
the
shed
raising
his
fingers
to
his
forehead
in
a
quick
and
timid
movement
as
a
sign
of
greeting
he
addressed
pierre
and
asked
whether
the
soldier
platoche
whom
he
had
asked
to
sew
a
shirt
for
him
was
in
this
shed
about
a
week
earlier
bootmaking
supplies
and
linen
cloth
had
been
distributed
to
the
french
and
the
soldiers
had
asked
the
prisoners
to
make
boots
and
shirts
for
them
its
ready
its
ready
little
falcon
said
karataev
coming
out
with
a
neatly
folded
shirt
on
account
of
the
warmth
and
in
order
to
work
comfortably
karataev
was
in
nothing
but
drawers
and
a
tattered
shirt
as
black
as
earth
his
hair
as
is
done
among
artisans
was
tied
with
a
strip
of
bast
and
his
round
face
looked
still
more
round
and
comely
promised
and
done
are
born
brothers
i
said
by
friday
and
so
i
did
said
platon
smiling
and
unfolding
the
shirt
he
had
made
the
frenchman
glanced
around
uneasily
and
as
if
overcoming
his
hesitations
quickly
took
off
his
jacket
and
put
on
the
shirt
under
the
jacket
there
was
no
shirt
on
the
frenchman
but
on
his
bare
yellow
thin
body
he
was
wearing
a
long
greasy
waistcoat
of
flowered
silk
the
frenchman
was
clearly
afraid
that
the
prisoners
would
laugh
looking
at
him
and
he
hastily
thrust
his
head
into
the
shirt
none
of
the
prisoners
said
a
word
see
its
just
right
platon
kept
saying
as
he
straightened
the
shirt
on
him
the
frenchman
having
put
his
head
and
arms
through
without
raising
his
eyes
studied
the
shirt
on
himself
and
examined
the
stitching
what
little
falcon
this
is
no
sewing
shop
weve
got
no
real
tools
they
say
you
cant
even
kill
a
louse
without
the
right
gear
platon
said
smiling
roundly
and
clearly
rejoicing
over
his
own
work
himself
cest
bien
cest
bien
merci
mais
vous
devez
avoir
de
la
toile
de
reste
said
the
frenchman
itll
fit
better
if
you
put
it
on
your
body
said
karataev
continuing
to
rejoice
over
his
work
see
itll
be
fine
and
nice
merci
merci
mon
vieux
le
reste
the
frenchman
repeated
smiling
and
taking
out
a
banknote
he
handed
it
to
karataev
mais
le
reste
pierre
saw
that
platon
did
not
want
to
understand
what
the
frenchman
was
saying
and
watched
them
without
interfering
karataev
thanked
him
for
the
money
and
went
on
admiring
his
work
the
frenchman
insisted
on
the
leftovers
and
asked
pierre
to
translate
what
he
said
what
does
he
need
the
leftovers
for
said
karataev
theyd
make
us
some
grand
foot
cloths
well
god
be
with
him
and
karataev
with
a
suddenly
changed
sad
face
took
the
bundle
of
scraps
from
his
bosom
and
handed
it
to
the
frenchman
without
looking
at
him
ah
well
said
karataev
and
he
went
back
inside
the
frenchman
looked
at
the
cloth
fell
to
thinking
glanced
questioningly
at
pierre
and
it
was
as
if
pierres
gaze
said
something
to

the
frenchman
suddenly
blushing
called
out
in
a
squeaky
voice
gardez
pour

he
said
handed
him
the
scraps
turned
and
walked
away
so
there
you
have
it
said
karataev
shaking
his
head
people
say
theyre
heathenish
but
theyve
got
souls
too
its
like
the
old
folks

and
here

karataev
looking
at
the
leftovers
with
a
pensive
smile
was
silent
for
a
time
and
dear
friend
theyll
make
the
grandest
foot

he
said
and
went
back
into
the
shed
xii
four
weeks
had
gone
by
since
pierre
was
taken
prisoner
though
the
french
had
offered
to
transfer
him
from
the
soldiers
shed
to
the
officers
he
had
stayed
in
the
shed
he
had
entered
on
the
first
day
in
devastated
and
burnt
moscow
pierre
experienced
almost
the
final
limits
of
privation
that
a
man
can
endure
but
owing
to
his
strong
constitution
and
health
which
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
until
then
and
especially
owing
to
the
fact
that
these
privations
came
so
imperceptibly
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
when
they
began
he
bore
his
situation
not
only
lightly
but
joyfully
and
precisely
in
that
time
he
received
the
peace
and
contentment
with
himself
which
he
had
previously
striven
for
in
vain
in
his
life
he
had
long
sought
in
various
directions
for
that
peace
that
harmony
with
himself
which
had
struck
him
so
much
in
the
soldiers
during
the
battle
of
borodinohe
had
sought
it
in
philanthropy
in
masonry
in
the
distractions
of
social
life
in
wine
in
a
heroic
deed
of
selfsacrifice
in
romantic
love
for
natasha
he
had
sought
it
by
way
of
thought
and
all
this
seeking
and
trying
had
disappointed
him
and
without
thinking
he
had
received
that
peace
and
harmony
with
himself
only
through
the
horror
of
death
through
privation
and
through
what
he
had
understood
in
karataev
it
was
as
if
those
terrible
moments
he
had
lived
through
during
the
execution
had
washed
forever
from
his
imagination
and
memory
the
anxious
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
once
seemed
important
to
him
no
thoughts
of
russia
or
of
the
war
or
of
politics
or
of
napoleon
came
to
him
it
was
obvious
to
him
that
all
this
did
not
concern
him
that
he
was
not
called
upon
and
therefore
could
not
judge
about
all
that
russia
and
hot
weather
dont
go
together
he
repeated
karataevs
words
and
those
words
strangely
calmed
him
his
intention
of
killing
napoleon
and
his
calculation
of
the
kabbalistic
number
and
the
beast
of
the
apocalypse
now
seemed
incomprehensible
and
even
ridiculous
to
him
his
anger
with
his
wife
and
his
anxiety
about
his
name
being
disgraced
now
seemed
to
him
not
only
insignificant
but
amusing
what
did
he
care
about
this
woman
leading
the
life
she
liked
somewhere
what
did
it
matter
to
anyone
especially
to
him
whether
or
not
they
found
out
that
their
prisoners
name
was
count
bezukhov
he
now
often
recalled
his
conversation
with
prince
andrei
and
fully
agreed
with
him
only
he
understood
prince
andreis
thought
slightly
differently
prince
andrei
had
thought
and
said
that
happiness
can
only
be
negative
but
had
said
it
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
and
irony
it
was
as
if
in
saying
it
he
was
voicing
another
thoughtthat
all
striving
for
positive
happiness
had
been
put
into
us
solely
in
order
to
torment
us
without
giving
satisfaction
but
pierre
acknowledged
the
correctness
of
it
without
any
second
thoughts
the
absence
of
suffering
the
satisfaction
of
ones
needs
and
the
resulting
freedom
to
choose
ones
occupation
that
is
ones
way
of
life
now
seemed
to
pierre
the
highest
and
most
unquestionable
human
happiness
here
only
now
did
pierre
fully
appreciate
for
the
first
time
the
enjoyment
of
food
when
he
wanted
to
eat
of
drink
when
he
wanted
to
drink
of
sleep
when
he
wanted
to
sleep
of
warmth
when
he
was
cold
of
talking
to
someone
when
he
wanted
to
talk
and
to
hear
a
human
voice
the
satisfaction
of
his
needsfor
good
food
cleanliness
freedomnow
that
he
was
deprived
of
them
all
seemed
perfect
happiness
to
pierre
and
the
choice
of
an
occupation
that
is
of
a
life
now
when
that
choice
was
so
limited
seemed
to
him
such
an
easy
matter
that
he
forgot
that
a
superfluity
of
lifes
comforts
destroys
all
the
happiness
of
the
satisfaction
of
ones
needs
and
that
a
greater
freedom
to
choose
ones
occupation
the
freedom
which
in
this
life
was
granted
him
by
education
wealth
social
positionprecisely
that
freedom
made
the
choice
of
an
occupation
insolubly
difficult
and
destroyed
the
very
need
and
possibility
of
an
occupation
all
pierres
dreams
were
now
turned
to
the
time
when
he
would
be
free
and
yet
afterwards
and
for
the
whole
of
his
life
pierre
thought
and
spoke
with
rapture
of
that
month
of
captivity
of
those
irrevocable
strong
and
joyful
sensations
and
above
all
of
that
full
peace
of
mind
that
perfect
inner
freedom
which
he
experienced
only
in
that
time
when
on
the
first
day
having
gotten
up
early
in
the
morning
he
went
out
of
the
shed
at
dawn
and
saw
the
at
first
dark
cupolas
and
crosses
of
the
novodevichye
convent
saw
the
frosty
dew
on
the
dusty
grass
saw
the
heights
of
the
sparrow
hills
and
the
wooded
bank
meandering
along
the
river
and
disappearing
into
the
purple
distance
when
he
sensed
the
touch
of
the
fresh
air
and
heard
the
noise
of
jackdaws
flying
across
the
field
from
moscow
and
when
the
light
then
suddenly
sprayed
from
the
east
and
the
rim
of
the
sun
floated
majestically
from
behind
a
cloud
and
the
cupolas
and
the
crosses
and
the
dew
and
the
distance
and
the
river
everything
began
to
play
in
the
joyful
lightpierre
felt
a
new
never
yet
experienced
feeling
of
the
joy
and
strength
of
life
and
that
feeling
not
only
did
not
abandon
him
through
all
the
time
of
his
captivity
but
on
the
contrary
kept
growing
in
him
as
the
hardships
of
his
situation
increased
that
feeling
of
readiness
for
anything
of
moral
fitness
was
maintained
still
more
in
pierre
by
the
high
opinion
of
him
which
soon
after
he
entered
the
shed
established
itself
among
his
comrades
with
his
knowledge
of
languages
the
respect
the
french
showed
him
the
simplicity
with
which
he
gave
everything
he
was
asked
for
he
received
an
officers
three
roubles
a
week
his
strength
which
he
showed
to
the
soldiers
by
pushing
nails
into
the
wall
of
the
shed
the
meekness
he
manifested
in
his
relations
with
his
comrades
his
ability
which
they
found
incomprehensible
to
sit
motionless
and
think
doing
nothing
pierre
seemed
something
of
a
mysterious
and
supreme
being
to
the
soldiers
the
very
qualities
which
in
the
world
he
formerly
lived
in
were
if
not
harmful
at
least
a
hindrance
to
himhis
strength
his
scorn
of
lifes
comforts
his
absentmindedness
his
simplicityhere
among
these
people
gave
him
almost
the
status
of
a
hero
and
pierre
felt
that
this
view
obliged
him
xiii
in
the
night
of
the
sixth
to
seventh
of
october
a
movement
of
departure
began
among
the
french
kitchens
and
sheds
were
broken
up
carts
were
loaded
and
troops
and
baggage
trains
moved
off
at
seven
oclock
in
the
morning
a
french
convoy
in
field
uniform
in
shakos
with
muskets
knapsacks
and
enormous
sacks
stood
in
front
of
the
sheds
and
lively
french
talk
interspersed
with
oaths
rolled
along
the
whole
line
in
the
shed
everyone
was
ready
dressed
belted
shod
and
only
waiting
for
the
order
to
leave
the
sick
soldier
sokolov
pale
thin
with
blue
circles
around
his
eyes
sat
in
his
place
the
only
one
unshod
and
undressed
staring
questioningly
with
eyes
prominent
in
his
emaciated
face
at
his
comrades
who
paid
no
attention
to
him
moaning
softly
and
regularly
clearly
what
made
him
moan
was
not
so
much
his
sufferinghe
was
sick
with
bleeding
diarrheaas
fear
and
grief
at
being
left
alone
pierre
belted
with
a
rope
and
shod
in
shoes
karataev
had
made
for
him
out
of
leather
from
a
tea
sack
that
a
frenchman
had
brought
to
mend
his
soles
went
over
to
the
sick
man
and
squatted
down
in
front
of
him
come
now
sokolov
theyre
not
leaving
altogether
theyve
got
a
hospital
here
maybe
youll
be
better
off
than
we
are
said
pierre
oh
lord
its
the
death
of
me
oh
lord
the
soldier
moaned
more
loudly
ill
ask
them
again
right
now
said
pierre
and
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
shed
as
he
was
going
to
the
door
the
corporal
who
had
offered
pierre
his
pipe
the
day
before
was
coming
to
it
from
outside
with
two
soldiers
the
corporal
and
the
soldiers
were
in
field
uniform
with
knapsacks
and
shakos
with
buckled
chin
straps
which
altered
their
familiar
faces
the
corporal
was
coming
to
the
door
to
close
it
by
order
of
his
superiors
the
prisoners
had
to
be
counted
before
being
let
out
caporal
que
feraton
du

pierre
began
but
as
he
was
saying
it
he
wondered
whether
this
was
the
corporal
he
knew
or
some
other
unknown
man
so
unlike
himself
the
corporal
was
at
that
moment
besides
that
just
as
pierre
was
saying
it
there
came
the
noise
of
drums
on
both
sides
the
corporal
frowned
at
pierres
words
and
uttering
a
senseless
oath
slammed
the
door
the
shed
became
semidark
on
both
sides
there
was
a
sharp
noise
of
drums
that
drowned
out
the
sick
mans
moans
here
it
ishere
it
is
again
pierre
said
to
himself
and
an
involuntary
chill
ran
down
his
spine
in
the
corporals
altered
face
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
the
arousing
and
engulfing
noise
of
the
drums
pierre
recognized
that
mysterious
indifferent
force
that
made
people
kill
their
own
kind
against
their
will
that
force
the
effect
of
which
he
had
seen
during
the
execution
to
fear
to
try
to
escape
that
force
to
turn
with
requests
or
admonitions
to
the
people
who
served
as
its
tools
was
useless
pierre
knew
that
now
one
had
to
wait
and
endure
pierre
did
not
go
back
to
the
sick
man
or
turn
to
look
at
him
he
stood
by
the
door
of
the
shed
frowning
silently
when
the
door
of
the
shed
was
opened
and
the
prisoners
like
a
herd
of
sheep
crushing
one
another
crowded
in
the
doorway
pierre
pushed
his
way
ahead
of
them
and
went
up
to
that
same
captain
who
on
the
corporals
assurance
was
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
the
captain
was
also
in
field
uniform
and
out
of
his
cold
face
looked
the
same
it
that
pierre
had
recognized
in
the
words
of
the
corporal
and
the
noise
of
the
drums
filez
filez
the
captain
kept
saying
frowning
sternly
and
looking
at
the
prisoners
crowding
past
him
pierre
knew
his
attempt
would
be
in
vain
but
he
went
up
to
him
eh

said
the
officer
looking
at
him
coldly
as
if
not
recognizing
him
pierre
told
him
about
the
sick
man
il

said
the
captain
filez

he
went
on
repeating
without
looking
at
pierre

the
captain
cried
frowning
angrily
tratatatam

beat
the
drums
and
pierre
realized
that
the
mysterious
force
now
fully
possessed
these
men
and
that
to
say
anything
more
now
was
useless
the
captive
officers
were
separated
from
the
soldiers
and
told
to
march
in
front
there
were
about
thirty
officers
pierre
among
them
and
about
three
hundred
soldiers
the
captive
officers
released
from
other
sheds
were
all
strangers
were
much
better
dressed
than
pierre
and
looked
at
him
in
his
footgear
with
mistrust
and
estrangement
not
far
from
pierre
walked
a
fat
major
with
a
puffy
yellow
angry
face
in
a
kazan
dressing
gown
tied
round
with
a
towel
who
was
clearly
held
in
general
respect
by
his
fellow
prisoners
he
kept
one
hand
with
a
tobacco
pouch
in
his
bosom
the
other
he
rested
on
his
longstemmed
chibouk
the
major
huffing
and
puffing
grumbled
and
was
angry
with
everybody
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
everybody
was
pushing
him
and
everybody
was
in
a
hurry
when
there
was
nowhere
to
hurry
to
that
everybody
was
surprised
at
something
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
another
a
small
thin
officer
kept
addressing
everybody
making
conjectures
about
where
they
were
going
now
and
how
far
they
would
manage
to
get
that
day
an
official
in
felt
boots
and
a
commissariat
uniform
kept
running
off
to
different
sides
looking
at
burntdown
moscow
loudly
reporting
his
observations
on
what
had
burned
down
and
which
was
this
or
that
moscow
that
came
into
sight
a
third
officer
of
polish
origin
judging
by
his
accent
argued
with
the
commissariat
official
proving
to
him
that
he
was
mistaken
in
identifying
the
neighborhoods
of
moscow
whats
there
to
argue
about
the
major
said
angrily
st
nicholas
or
st
vlas
its
all
the
same
you
can
see
its
all
burned
down
and
thats
the
end
of
itwhy
are
you
pushing
as
if
theres
not
road
enough
he
turned
gruffly
to
a
man
walking
behind
him
who
had
not
pushed
him
at
all
ai
ai
ai
what
have
they
done
the
voices
of
the
prisoners
were
heard
nevertheless
now
on
one
side
now
on
another
as
they
looked
at
the
charred
ruins
zamoskvorechye
and
zubovo
and
in
the
kremlin
look
half
of
its
missingi
told
you
it
was
the
whole
of
zamoskvorechye
and
so
it
is
well
you
know
its
burned
down
so
whats
there
to
talk
about
said
the
major
going
past
the
church
in
khamovniki
one
of
the
few
unburnt
neighborhoods
of
moscow
the
whole
crowd
of
prisoners
suddenly
pressed
to
one
side
and
exclamations
of
horror
and
revulsion
were
heard
see
the
scoundrels
real
heathens
yes
dead
hes

with
something
pierre
also
moved
towards
the
church
where
that
which
had
caused
such
exclamations
was
and
vaguely
saw
something
propped
against
the
church
fence
from
the
words
of
his
comrades
who
could
see
better
than
he
he
learned
that
this
something
was
the
corpse
of
a
man
stood
upright
against
the
fence
and
his
face
smeared
with
soot

cursed
the

guards
and
with
renewed
animosity
the
french
soldiers
used
their
swords
to
disperse
the
crowd
of
prisoners
looking
at
the
dead
man
xiv
through
the
lanes
of
khamovniki
the
prisoners
walked
alone
with
their
convoy
and
the
carts
and
wagons
belonging
to
the
convoy
followed
behind
but
coming
out
to
the
supply
storehouses
they
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
a
huge
compactly
moving
artillery
train
interspersed
with
private
carts
by
the
bridge
they
all
stopped
waiting
for
those
who
were
ahead
to
move
on
from
the
bridge
the
prisoners
could
see
endless
lines
of
moving
carts
behind
and
ahead
of
them
to
the
right
where
the
kaluga
road
curved
around
the
neskuchny
garden
endless
lines
of
troops
and
carts
stretched
out
disappearing
into
the
distance
these
were
the
troops
of
beauharnaiss
corps
which
had
started
out
before
all
the
rest
behind
along
the
embankment
and
across
the
kamenny
bridge
stretched
the
troops
and
trains
of
ney
the
troops
of
davout
to
which
the
prisoners
belonged
went
across
the
krymsky
ford
and
some
had
already
entered
kaluga
street
but
the
trains
were
so
strung
out
that
the
last
trains
of
beauharnais
had
not
yet
come
out
of
moscow
onto
kaluga
street
and
the
head
of
neys
troops
was
already
leaving
bolshaya
ordynka
having
crossed
the
krymsky
ford
the
prisoners
moved
on
several
steps
then
stopped
then
moved
on
again
and
on
all
sides
the
people
and
vehicles
grew
more
and
more
dense
it
took
them
an
hour
to
walk
the
several
hundred
steps
that
separated
the
bridge
from
kaluga
street
and
having
reached
the
square
where
zamoskvoretskaya
and
kaluga
streets
met
the
prisoners
pressed
together
in
a
mass
stopped
and
stood
at
that
intersection
for
several
hours
on
all
sides
could
be
heard
the
rumble
of
wheels
incessant
as
the
roar
of
the
sea
and
the
tramp
of
feet
and
incessant
angry
shouts
and
curses
pierre
stood
pressed
to
the
wall
of
a
charred
house
listening
to
that
sound
which
merged
in
his
imagination
with
the
sounds
of
a
drum
several
captive
officers
in
order
to
see
better
climbed
the
wall
of
the
charred
house
by
which
pierre

standing

russian

wenches
sitting
so
comfortably
in
their
caleches
again
a
wave
of
general
curiosity
as
by
the
church
in
khamovniki
pushed
all
the
prisoners
towards
the
road
and
pierre
thanks
to
his
height
saw
over
the
heads
of
the
others
what
had
attracted
the
prisoners
curiosity
in
three
carriages
mixed
up
among
the
ammunition
caissons
sitting
tightly
packed
together
rode
women
decked
out
in
bright
colors
heavily
rouged
shouting
something
in
squeaky
voices
from
the
moment
pierre
recognized
the
appearance
of
the
mysterious
force
nothing
seemed
strange
or
frightful
to
him
not
the
corpse
smeared
with
soot
for
the
fun
of
it
not
these
women
hurrying
somewhere
not
the
charred
ruins
of
moscow
everything
that
pierre
now
saw
made
almost
no
impression
on
himas
if
his
soul
preparing
for
a
difficult
struggle
refused
to
receive
impressions
that
might
weaken
it
the
train
with
the
women
passed
by
behind
them
again
drew
carts
soldiers
wagons
soldiers
flatbeds
carriages
soldiers
caissons
soldiers
and
occasionally
women
pierre
did
not
see
people
separately
but
saw
their
movement
all
these
people
and
horses
were
as
if
driven
by
some
invisible
force
all
of
them
in
the
course
of
the
hour
during
which
pierre
observed
them
came
sailing
out
of
various
streets
with
one
and
the
same
desire
to
move
on
quickly
all
of
them
in
the
same
way
running
into
the
others
began
to
get
angry
and
fight
white
teeth
were
bared
brows
frowned
the
same
oaths
were
exchanged
and
all
the
faces
had
the
same
dashingly
resolute
and
cruelly
cold
expression
that
had
struck
pierre
in
the
morning
at
the
sound
of
the
drum
on
the
corporals
face
towards
evening
the
leader
of
the
convoy
gathered
his
crew
and
with
shouts
and
quarrels
squeezed
into
the
train
and
the
prisoners
surrounded
on
all
sides
came
out
onto
the
kaluga
road
they
marched
very
quickly
without
resting
and
stopped
only
when
the
sun
began
to
go
down
the
carts
all
drew
up
close
to
each
other
and
people
began
to
prepare
for
the
night
everyone
seemed
angry
and
displeased
for
a
long
time
curses
spiteful
cries
and
the
sounds
of
fighting
came
from
all
sides
a
carriage
that
was
driving
behind
the
convoy
pulled
up
close
to
a
convoy
wagon
and
punched
its
shaft
through
it
several
soldiers
came
running
to
the
wagon
from
different
sides
some
beat
the
horses
hitched
to
the
carriage
on
their
heads
trying
to
get
them
to
turn
away
others
fought
among
themselves
and
pierre
saw
that
one
german
was
badly
wounded
on
the
head
by
a
sword
it
seemed
that
these
men
once
they
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
field
in
the
chill
twilight
of
the
autumn
evening
all
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
unpleasant
awakening
from
the
haste
and
headlong
movement
somewhere
that
had
come
over
them
at
the
start
having
stopped
it
was
as
if
they
all
realized
that
they
did
not
yet
know
where
they
were
going
and
that
in
this
movement
there
would
be
much
that
was
painful
and
difficult
at
this
halt
the
convoy
treated
the
prisoners
still
worse
than
at
the
start
for
the
first
time
the
prisoners
received
their
ration
of
meat
in
horseflesh
from
the
officers
to
the
last
soldier
there
could
be
noticed
in
each
of
them
a
personal
animosity
as
it
were
against
each
of
the
prisoners
which
quite
unexpectedly
replaced
the
former
friendly
relations
this
animosity
increased
still
more
when
on
taking
count
of
the
prisoners
it
turned
out
that
during
the
bustle
as
they
were
leaving
moscow
one
russian
soldier
pretending
to
have
a
stomach
ache
had
escaped
pierre
heard
how
a
frenchman
had
beaten
a
russian
soldier
for
straying
too
far
from
the
road
and
heard
his
friend
the
captain
reprimand
the
sergeant
for
the
russian
prisoners
escape
and
threaten
to
courtmartial
him
to
the
sergeants
excuse
that
the
soldier
was
ill
and
could
not
walk
the
captain
said
that
the
order
was
to
shoot
those
who
lagged
behind
pierre
felt
that
the
fatal
force
which
had
crushed
him
during
the
execution
and
which
had
been
imperceptible
during
his
imprisonment
now
once
again
took
possession
of
his
existence
it
frightened
him
but
he
felt
how
as
the
fatal
force
made
efforts
to
crush
him
a
force
of
life
independent
of
it
arose
and
grew
stronger
in
his
soul
pierre
ate
his
supper
of
ryemeal
soup
with
horsemeat
and
talked
with
his
comrades
neither
pierre
nor
any
of
his
comrades
spoke
of
what
they
had
seen
in
moscow
or
of
the
rough
treatment
of
the
french
or
of
the
instructions
to
shoot
that
had
been
announced
to
them
as
if
to
ward
off
the
worsening
situation
they
were
all
especially
animated
and
cheerful
people
talked
of
personal
memories
of
funny
scenes
witnessed
during
the
march
and
changed
the
subject
when
it
came
to
the
present
situation
the
sun
had
set
long
ago
bright
stars
lit
up
here
and
there
red
as
fire
the
glow
of
the
rising
full
moon
spread
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
and
the
enormous
red
ball
wavered
astonishingly
in
the
grayish
haze
it
was
growing
light
the
evening
was
already
over
but
night
had
not
yet
begun
pierre
got
up
and
walked
away
from
his
new
comrades
between
the
campfires
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
where
he
was
told
the
captive
soldiers
were
camped
he
wanted
to
talk
with
them
on
the
road
a
french
sentry
stopped
him
and
told
him
to
go
back
pierre
went
back
but
not
to
the
campfire
to
his
comrades
but
to
an
unhitched
cart
where
there
was
no
one
crossing
his
legs
and
lowering
his
head
he
sat
on
the
cold
ground
by
the
wheel
of
the
cart
and
stayed
there
motionless
for
a
long
time
thinking
more
than
an
hour
went
by
no
one
disturbed
pierre
suddenly
he
burst
into
his
fat
goodnatured
laugh
so
loudly
that
people
from
different
sides
turned
in
astonishment
towards
this
strange
evidently
solitary
laughter
ha
ha
ha
laughed
pierre
and
he
said
aloud
to
himself
the
soldier
wouldnt
let
me
go
they
caught
me
they
locked
me
up
theyre
holding
me
prisoner
who
me
me
memy
immortal
soul
ha
ha
haha
ha
ha
he
laughed
with
tears
brimming
his
eyes
some
man
got
up
and
came
to
see
what
the
strange
big
man
was
laughing
about
by
himself
pierre
stopped
laughing
got
up
went
further
away
from
the
curious
fellow
and
looked
around
the
enormous
endless
bivouac
noisy
earlier
with
the
crackling
of
campfires
and
the
talking
of
men
was
growing
still
the
red
flames
of
the
campfires
were
dying
out
and
turning
pale
the
full
moon
stood
high
in
the
bright
sky
forests
and
fields
invisible
earlier
beyond
the
territory
of
the
camp
now
opened
out
in
the
distance
and
further
beyond
these
forests
and
fields
could
be
seen
the
bright
wavering
endless
distance
calling
one
to
itself
pierre
looked
into
the
sky
into
the
depths
of
the
retreating
twinkling
stars
and
all
this
is
mine
and
all
this
is
in
me
and
all
this
is
me
thought
pierre
and
all
this
theyve
caught
and
put
in
a
shed
and
boarded
it
up
he
smiled
and
went
to
his
comrades
to
lie
down
and
sleep
xv
in
the
first
days
of
october
another
envoy
came
to
kutuzov
with
a
letter
from
napoleon
and
an
offer
of
peace
deceptively
addressed
from
moscow
while
napoleon
was
already
not
far
ahead
of
kutuzov
on
the
old
kaluga
road
kutuzovs
reply
to
this
letter
was
the
same
as
to
the
first
sent
with
lauriston
he
said
there
could
be
no
question
of
peace
soon
after
that
information
was
received
from
dorokhovs
partisan
detachment
moving
about
to
the
left
of
tarutino
that
troops
had
appeared
in
fominskoe
that
those
troops
consisted
of
broussiers
division
and
that
that
division
separated
from
the
other
troops
could
easily
be
exterminated
again
the
soldiers
and
officers
called
for
action
the
staff
generals
stirred
by
the
memory
of
the
easy
victory
at
tarutino
insisted
that
kutuzov
act
upon
dorokhovs
suggestion
kutuzov
did
not
consider
any
offensive
necessary
what
happened
was
between
the
two
as
it
was
bound
to
be
a
small
detachment
was
sent
to
fominskoe
to
attack
broussier
by
a
strange
chance
this
assignmentthe
most
difficult
and
important
as
it
turned
out
laterfell
to
dokhturov
that
same
modest
little
dokhturov
whom
no
one
has
ever
described
to
us
as
drawing
up
plans
of
battle
flying
at
the
head
of
regiments
throwing
crosses
on
batteries
and
so
on
who
was
considered
and
called
irresolute
and
imperceptive
that
same
dokhturov
whom
during
all
the
wars
between
the
russians
and
the
french
from
austerlitz
to
the
year
thirteen
we
find
in
command
wherever
the
situation
is
difficult
at
austerlitz
he
is
the
last
to
remain
at
the
dam
of
augesd
gathering
the
regiments
saving
whatever
is
possible
when
all
are
fleeing
and
perishing
and
there
is
not
one
general
left
in
the
rear
guard
sick
in
a
fever
he
goes
to
smolensk
with
twenty
thousand
men
to
defend
the
city
against
the
entire
napoleonic
army
in
smolensk
he
has
just
dozed
off
by
the
molokhovsky
gate
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
when
he
is
awakened
by
a
cannonade
aimed
at
smolensk
and
smolensk
holds
out
for
the
whole
day
in
the
battle
of
borodino
when
bagration
has
been
killed
and
the
troops
of
our
left
flank
have
been
wiped
out
in
a
proportion
of
nine
to
one
and
the
full
force
of
the
french
artillery
is
directed
therenone
other
than
the
irresolute
and
imperceptive
dokhturov
is
sent
there
and
kutuzov
having
first
sent
someone
else
hastily
corrects
his
mistake
and
quiet
little
dokhturov
goes
there
and
borodino
is
the
best
glory
of
the
russian
army
and
many
heroes
have
been
described
for
us
in
verse
and
prose
but
there
is
hardly
a
word
about
dokhturov
again
dokhturov
is
sent
to
fominskoe
and
from
there
to
maly
yaroslavets
to
the
place
where
the
last
battle
with
the
french
was
fought
to
the
place
from
which
the
destruction
of
the
french
army
obviously
begins
and
again
many
geniuses
and
heroes
are
described
for
us
from
that
period
of
the
campaign
but
of
dokhturov
not
a
word
or
very
little
and
that
questionable
this
silence
about
dokhturov
is
the
most
obvious
proof
of
his
merit
to
a
man
who
does
not
understand
the
workings
of
a
machine
it
naturally
seems
when
he
sees
it
in
operation
that
the
most
important
the
machine
is
the
chip
of
wood
that
accidentally
got
into
it
and
is
tossed
about
in
it
interfering
with
its
working
a
man
who
does
not
know
the
construction
of
the
machine
cannot
understand
that
it
is
not
this
harmful
and
interfering
chip
of
wood
but
that
little
transmission
gear
turning
noiselessly
that
is
one
of
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
machine
on
the
tenth
of
october
the
same
day
that
dokhturov
got
halfway
to
fominskoe
and
halted
in
the
village
of
aristovo
preparing
to
carry
out
with
precision
the
order
he
had
been
given
the
entire
french
army
having
reached
in
its
convulsive
movement
the
position
of
murat
seemingly
in
order
to
give
battle
suddenly
without
any
reason
turned
left
onto
the
new
kaluga
road
and
began
to
enter
fominskoe
which
had
previously
been
occupied
only
by
broussier
at
that
time
dokhturov
had
under
his
command
besides
dorokhov
the
two
small
detachments
of
figner
and
seslavin
in
the
evening
of
the
eleventh
of
october
seslavin
came
to
the
headquarters
in
aristovo
with
a
french
guard
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
the
prisoner
said
that
the
troops
that
had
just
entered
fominskoe
were
the
vanguard
of
the
whole
big
army
that
napoleon
was
there
that
the
whole
army
had
already
left
moscow
five
days
ago
that
same
evening
a
servant
from
borovsk
told
how
he
had
seen
an
enormous
army
enter
the
town
the
cossacks
of
dorokhovs
detachment
reported
that
they
had
seen
french
guards
going
down
the
road
to
borovsk
from
all
this
information
it
became
obvious
that
where
they
had
thought
to
find
one
division
there
was
now
the
whole
french
army
coming
from
moscow
in
an
unexpected
directiondown
the
old
kaluga
road
dokhturov
did
not
want
to
undertake
anything
since
it
was
not
clear
to
him
now
what
his
duty
was
he
had
been
ordered
to
attack
fominskoe
but
earlier
only
broussier
had
been
in
fominskoe
now
there
was
the
whole
french
army
ermolov
wanted
to
act
at
his
own
discretion
but
dokhturov
insisted
that
they
had
to
have
an
order
from
his
serenity
it
was
decided
to
send
a
report
to
the
staff
for
that
a
sensible
officer
was
chosen
bolkhovitinov
who
besides
the
written
report
was
to
recount
the
whole
matter
in
his
own
words
it
was
past
eleven
when
bolkhovitinov
having
received
the
envelope
and
verbal
instructions
galloped
to
staff
headquarters
accompanied
by
a
cossack
and
spare
horses
xvi
the
night
was
dark
warm
autumnal
light
rain
was
falling
for
the
fourth
day
having
changed
horses
twice
and
galloped
twenty
miles
in
an
hour
and
a
half
over
a
muddy
sticky
road
bolkhovitinov
reached
letashevka
before
two
oclock
in
the
morning
dismounting
at
a
cottage
where
a
sign
reading
staff
headquarters
was
hung
on
a
wattle
fence
he
left
his
horse
and
went
into
the
dark
front
hall
the
general
on
duty
quickly
a
matter
of
great
importance
he
said
to
someone
who
was
getting
up
and
puffing
in
the
darkness
of
the
front
hall
he
was
very
sick
in
the
evening
its
the
third
night
he
hasnt
slept
the
solicitous
voice
of
an
orderly
whispered
better
wake
the
captain
first
a
very
important
message
from
general
dokhturov
said
bolkhovitinov
feeling
his
way
to
the
door
and
opening
it
the
orderly
went
ahead
of
him
and
began
waking
someone
up
your
honor
your
honora
coullier
what
what
from
whom
said
someones
sleepy
voice
from
dokhturov
and
alexei
petrovich
napoleon
is
in
fominskoe
said
bolkhovitinov
not
seeing
in
the
darkness
who
was
questioning
him
but
supposing
by
the
voice
that
it
was
not
konovnitsyn
the
awakened
man
yawned
and
stretched
i
really
dont
want
to
wake
him
up
he
said
feeling
for
something
hes
quite
ill
maybe
its
just
rumors

bolkhovitinov
the
order
was
to

found

he
added
the
orderly
was
striking
a
light
shcherbinin
was
feeling
for
the
candlestick
ah
loathesome
creatures
he
said
with
revulsion
by
the
light
of
the
sparks
bolkhovitinov
saw
the
young
face
of
shcherbinin
with
the
candle
and
in
the
front
corner
a
stillsleeping
man
this
was
konovnitsyn
when
the
sulfur
crumbs
caught
fire
from
the
tinder
giving
first
a
blue
then
a
red
flame
shcherbinin
lit
a
tallow
candle
causing
the
cockroaches
that
were
gnawing
on
it
to
flee
from
the
candlestick
and
looked
at
the
messenger
bolkhovitinov
was
all
covered
with
mud
and
wiping
it
with
his
sleeve
he
smeared
it
over
his
face
whose
report
is
it
asked
shcherbinin
taking
the
envelope
the
information
is
correct
said
bolkhovitinov
the
prisoners
the
cossacks
and
the
scouts
all
unanimously
bear
out
the
same
thing
no
help
for
it
well
have
to
wake
him
up
said
shcherbinin
getting
up
and
going
over
to
the
man
in
the
nightcap
covered
with
a
greatcoat
pyotr
petrovich
he
said
konovnitsyn
did
not
stir
to
staff
headquarters
he
said
smiling
knowing
that
these
words
were
sure
to
wake
him
up
and
indeed
the
head
in
the
nightcap
rose
at
once
the
handsome
firm
face
of
konovnitsyn
with
its
feverishly
inflamed
cheeks
still
kept
for
a
moment
an
expression
of
dreamy
sleep
far
from
the
present
situation
but
then
he
suddenly
gave
a
start
his
face
assumed
his
usual
calm
and
firm
expression
well
what
is
it
from
whom
he
asked
unhurriedly
but
at
once
blinking
from
the
light
listening
to
the
officers
report
konovnitsyn
opened
the
letter
and
read
it
having
barely
read
it
he
lowered
his
feet
in
woollen
stockings
to
the
beatenearth
floor
and
began
putting
his
boots
on
then
he
took
off
his
nightcap
combed
his
sidewhiskers
and
put
on
his
peaked
cap
were
you
quick
in
getting
here
lets
go
to
his
serenity
konovnitsyn
realized
at
once
that
the
news
brought
to
him
was
of
great
importance
and
brooked
no
delay
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
he
did
not
consider
or
ask
himself
that
did
not
interest
him
he
looked
at
the
whole
business
of
war
not
with
his
mind
not
with
his
reason
but
with
something
else
there
was
a
deep
unspoken
conviction
in
his
soul
that
all
would
be
well
but
that
it
was
not
to
be
believed
still
less
spoken
about
and
that
he
had
only
to
do
his
duty
and
this
duty
of
his
he
did
giving
all
his
forces
to
it
pyotr
petrovich
konovnitsyn
like
dokhturov
was
put
on
the
list
of
the
socalled
heroes
of
the
year
twelvethe
barclays
the
raevskys
the
ermolovs
the
platovs
the
miloradovichsmerely
out
of
propriety
as
it
were
like
dokhturov
he
had
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
quite
limited
abilities
and
knowledge
and
like
dokhturov
konovnitsyn
never
made
plans
of
battles
but
was
always
where
things
were
most
difficult
since
his
appointment
as
general
on
duty
he
had
always
slept
with
the
door
open
giving
instructions
that
every
messenger
should
wake
him
up
in
battle
he
was
always
under
fire
so
that
kutuzov
reproached
him
for
it
and
was
afraid
to
send
him
in
and
like
dokhturov
he
was
one
of
those
inconspicuous
gears
which
without
clatter
or
noise
constitute
the
most
essential
the
machine
coming
out
of
the
cottage
into
the
damp
dark
night
konovnitsyn
frowned
partly
from
an
increased
pain
in
his
head
partly
from
the
unpleasant
thought
that
came
to
him
about
how
that
whole
nest
of
influential
staff
people
would
now
get
stirred
up
at
this
news
especially
bennigsen
who
after
tarutino
was
at
daggers
drawn
with
kutuzov
how
they
would
suggest
argue
order
cancel
and
this
presentiment
was
unpleasant
to
him
though
he
knew
it
was
impossible
to
do
without
it
in
fact
toll
to
whom
he
came
to
report
the
fresh
news
at
once
began
laying
out
his
considerations
to
the
general
who
lived
with
him
and
konovnitsyn
who
listened
silently
and
wearily
reminded
him
that
they
must
go
to
his
serenity
xvii
kutuzov
like
all
old
people
slept
little
at
night
during
the
day
he
often
dozed
off
unexpectedly
but
at
night
lying
on
his
bed
without
undressing
he
was
for
the
most
and
thinking
so
he
was
lying
in
bed
now
propping
his
big
heavy
disfigured
head
on
his
plump
hand
and
thinking
his
one
open
eye
peering
into
the
darkness
since
bennigsen
who
corresponded
with
the
sovereign
and
had
the
most
power
on
the
staff
had
been
avoiding
him
kutuzov
had
been
more
at
ease
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
he
and
his
troops
would
not
be
forced
again
to
take
useless
offensive
action
the
lesson
of
the
battle
of
tarutino
and
its
eve
painfully
memorable
to
kutuzov
should
also
have
its
effect
he
thought
they
should
understand
that
we
can
only
lose
by
going
on
the
offensive
patience
and
time
these
are
my
mighty
warriors
thought
kutuzov
he
knew
that
an
apple
should
not
be
picked
while
it
is
green
it
will
fall
by
itself
when
it
is
ripe
but
if
you
pick
it
green
you
will
spoil
the
apple
and
the
tree
and
you
will
set
your
teeth
on
edge
like
an
experienced
hunter
he
knew
that
the
beast
was
wounded
wounded
as
badly
as
the
whole
russian
force
could
wound
it
but
whether
mortally
or
not
was
still
an
unclarified
question
now
by
the
dispatches
of
lauriston
and
barth233lemy
and
by
the
reports
of
the
partisans
kutuzov
almost
knew
that
it
was
mortally
wounded
but
more
proofs
were
needed
he
had
to
wait
they
want
to
run
and
look
at
how
theyve
killed
him
wait
youll
see
all
this
maneuvering
all
this
advancing
he
thought
what
for
all
to
distinguish
themselves
as
if
theres
something
amusing
in
fighting
theyre
just
like
children
whom
you
cannot
get
to
tell
you
how
the
thing
went
because
all
they
want
is
to
prove
that
they
know
how
to
fight
but
thats
not
the
point
now
and
what
artful
maneuvers
all
of
them
suggest
to
me
it
seems
to
them
that
if
they
think
up
two
or
three
cases
the
general
plan
from
petersburg
came
to
his
mind
theyve
thought
of
them
all
but
theres
no
counting
them
the
unresolved
question
of
whether
the
wound
inflicted
at
borodino
was
mortal
or
not
had
been
hanging
over
kutuzovs
head
for
a
whole
month
on
the
one
hand
the
french
had
occupied
moscow
on
the
other
hand
kutuzov
felt
unquestionably
with
his
whole
being
that
that
terrible
blow
in
which
he
together
with
all
the
russian
people
had
strained
all
his
forces
must
be
mortal
but
in
any
case
proofs
were
needed
and
he
had
been
waiting
for
them
for
a
month
already
and
the
more
time
that
passed
the
more
impatient
he
became
lying
on
his
bed
during
his
sleepless
nights
he
did
the
same
thing
that
all
these
young
generals
were
doing
the
same
thing
for
which
he
reproached
them
he
thought
up
all
the
possible
occasions
in
which
this
certain
already
accomplished
destruction
of
napoleon
could
be
manifested
he
thought
of
them
all
just
as
the
young
men
did
but
with
the
difference
that
he
based
no
suppositions
on
them
and
saw
not
two
or
three
of
them
but
thousands
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
of
them
he
imagined
he
thought
up
all
sorts
of
movements
of
the
napoleonic
army
as
a
whole
or
in
partstowards
petersburg
against
him
skirting
around
him
thought
up
as
well
the
case
which
he
was
most
afraid
of
that
napoleon
would
start
fighting
him
with
his
own
weapon
that
he
would
remain
in
moscow
waiting
for
him
kutuzov
even
thought
up
the
movement
of
the
napoleonic
army
back
towards
medyn
and
yukhnov
but
the
one
thing
he
was
unable
to
foresee
was
the
thing
that
happened
that
insane
convulsive
rushing
about
of
napoleons
troops
in
the
course
of
the
first
eleven
days
after
leaving
moscowa
rushing
about
which
made
possible
what
kutuzov
did
not
yet
dare
to
think
of
at
that
time
the
total
extermination
of
the
french
dorokhovs
reports
about
broussiers
division
the
news
from
the
partisans
about
the
distress
of
napoleons
army
the
rumors
about
preparations
for
abandoning
moscoweverything
confirmed
the
supposition
that
the
french
army
was
beaten
and
preparing
to
flee
but
these
were
only
suppositions
which
seemed
important
to
the
young
men
but
not
to
kutuzov
with
his
sixty
years
of
experience
he
knew
what
weight
should
be
ascribed
to
rumors
knew
how
capable
people
who
desire
something
are
of
grouping
all
the
information
in
such
a
way
that
it
seems
to
confirm
what
they
desire
and
knew
how
willingly
on
such
occasions
they
omit
all
that
contradicts
it
and
the
more
kutuzov
desired
it
the
less
he
allowed
himself
to
believe
it
this
question
occupied
all
his
inner
forces
all
the
rest
was
for
him
only
the
habitual
acting
out
of
life
his
conversations
with
the
staff
his
letters
to
mme
de
sta235l
which
he
wrote
from
tarutino
his
reading
of
novels
distribution
of
rewards
correspondence
with
petersburg
and
so
on
were
the
same
habitual
acting
out
of
and
submission
to
life
but
the
destruction
of
the
french
foreseen
by
him
alone
was
his
heartfelt
his
sole
desire
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
october
he
was
lying
propped
on
his
hand
and
thinking
about
that
there
was
a
stir
in
the
next
room
and
the
footsteps
of
toll
konovnitsyn
and
bolkhovitinov
were
heard
hey
whos
there
come
in
come
in
whats
new
the
field
marshal
called
to
them
while
the
footman
was
lighting
a
candle
toll
told
him
the
content
of
the
news
who
brought
it
asked
kutuzov
with
a
face
that
struck
toll
once
the
candle
was
lit
by
its
cold
sternness
there
can
be
no
doubt
your
serenity
call
him
call
him
here
kutuzov
sat
up
one
leg
lowered
from
the
bed
and
his
big
belly
leaning
on
the
other
bent
leg
his
good
eye
was
narrowed
the
better
to
see
the
messenger
as
if
he
wanted
to
read
in
his
features
what
so
preoccupied
him
tell
me
tell
me
friend
he
said
to
bolkhovitinov
in
his
quiet
old
mans
voice
closing
the
shirt
that
had
opened
on
his
chest
come
come
closer
whats
the
word
youve
brought
me
eh
has
napoleon
left
moscow
truly
eh
bolkhovitinov
first
reported
in
detail
what
he
had
been
ordered
to
speak
speak
quicker
dont
torment
my
soul
kutuzov
interrupted
him
bolkhovitinov
told
him
everything
and
fell
silent
awaiting
orders
toll
began
to
say
something
but
kutuzov
interrupted
him
he
wanted
to
say
something
but
suddenly
his
face
shriveled
wrinkled
waving
his
hand
at
toll
he
turned
the
other
way
to
the
corner
of
the
room
with
its
blackened
icons
lord
my
creator
thou
hast
heeded
our
prayer
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
clasping
his
hands
russia
is
saved
i
thank
thee
lord
and
he
wept
xviii
from
the
time
of
this
news
until
the
end
of
the
campaign
kutuzovs
entire
activity
consists
only
of
restraining
his
troops
by
power
cunning
and
entreaties
from
useless
attacks
maneuvers
and
clashes
with
the
perishing
enemy
dokhturov
goes
to
maloyaroslavets
but
kutuzov
hangs
back
with
the
whole
army
and
gives
orders
to
vacate
kaluga
and
retreat
beyond
it
which
seems
quite
possible
to
him
kutuzov
retreats
everywhere
but
the
enemy
without
waiting
for
him
to
retreat
flees
back
in
the
opposite
direction
napoleons
historians
describe
to
us
his
skillful
maneuver
towards
tarutino
and
maloyaroslavets
and
make
conjectures
as
to
what
would
have
happened
if
napoleon
had
managed
to
penetrate
to
the
rich
southern
provinces
but
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
nothing
prevented
napoleon
from
going
to
those
southern
provinces
since
the
russian
army
gave
way
to
him
the
historians
forget
that
napoleons
army
could
not
have
been
saved
by
anything
because
by
then
it
already
bore
within
itself
the
conditions
of
inevitable
destruction
why
should
this
army
which
found
abundant
provisions
in
moscow
and
could
not
keep
them
but
trampled
them
underfoot
this
army
which
on
coming
to
smolensk
did
not
distribute
provisions
but
looted
themwhy
should
this
army
have
been
able
to
set
itself
to
rights
in
kaluga
province
populated
by
the
same
russians
as
in
moscow
and
where
fire
had
the
same
property
of
burning
up
what
was
set
aflame
this
army
could
not
set
itself
to
rights
anywhere
since
the
battle
of
borodino
and
the
looting
of
moscow
it
had
borne
within
itself
as
it
were
the
chemical
conditions
of
its
decomposition
the
men
of
this
former
army
fled
with
their
leaders
not
knowing
where
themselves
wishing
napoleon
and
every
soldier
for
only
one
thing
to
extricate
themselves
personally
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
hopeless
situation
which
they
were
all
albeit
dimly
aware
of
it
was
only
because
of
this
at
the
council
in
maloyaroslavets
when
the
generals
pretending
to
confer
offered
various
opinions
that
the
last
opinion
given
by
the
simple
soldier
mouton
who
said
what
they
all
thought
that
they
only
had
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
sealed
all
their
lips
and
no
one
not
even
napoleon
could
say
anything
against
this
truth
which
they
were
all
aware
of
but
though
they
all
knew
they
had
to
get
away
there
still
remained
the
shame
of
the
awareness
that
they
had
to
flee
and
they
needed
an
external
push
which
would
overcome
that
shame
and
that
push
came
at
the
right
moment
it
was
what
the
french
called
le
hourra
de
lempereur
the
day
after
the
council
early
in
the
morning
pretending
that
he
wanted
to
inspect
the
troops
and
the
field
of
the
past
and
future
battles
napoleon
rode
with
his
suite
of
marshals
and
an
escort
through
the
middle
of
the
line
of
deployed
troops
some
cossacks
poking
around
for
booty
ran
into
the
emperor
and
nearly
caught
him
if
the
cossacks
did
not
catch
napoleon
that
time
what
saved
him
was
the
very
thing
that
destroyed
the
french
the
plunder
which
at
tarutino
and
here
the
cossacks
fell
upon
letting
the
men
go
paying
no
attention
to
napoleon
they
fell
upon
the
booty
and
napoleon
managed
to
get
away
if
les
enfants
du
don
could
all
but
catch
the
emperor
himself
in
the
middle
of
his
army
it
was
clear
that
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
but
flee
as
quickly
as
possible
down
the
nearest
known
road
napoleon
with
his
fortyyearolds
potbelly
feeling
himself
no
longer
as
nimble
and
brave
as
before
understood
that
hint
and
under
the
influence
of
the
scare
the
cossacks
had
given
him
he
promptly
agreed
with
mouton
and
gave
as
the
historians
say
the
order
to
retreat
back
to
the
smolensk
road
that
napoleon
agreed
with
mouton
and
that
the
troops
marched
back
does
not
prove
that
he
ordered
it
but
that
the
forces
acting
upon
the
whole
army
in
the
sense
of
directing
it
down
the
mozhaisk
road
acted
simultaneously
upon
napoleon
xix
when
a
man
finds
himself
in
motion
he
always
thinks
up
a
goal
for
that
motion
in
order
to
walk
a
thousand
miles
a
man
needs
to
think
that
there
is
something
good
at
the
end
of
those
thousand
miles
one
needs
a
vision
of
the
promised
land
in
order
to
have
the
strength
to
move
the
promised
land
for
the
advancing
french
was
moscow
for
the
retreat
it
was
their
native
land
but
their
native
land
was
too
far
away
and
a
man
walking
a
thousand
miles
must
say
to
himself
forgetting
the
final
goal
today
i
will
walk
thirty
miles
to
a
resting
place
and
spend
the
night
and
during
this
first
march
the
resting
place
overshadows
the
final
goal
and
concentrates
all
desires
and
hopes
on
itself
the
yearnings
manifested
in
a
separate
man
are
always
magnified
in
a
crowd
for
the
french
going
back
down
the
old
smolensk
road
the
final
goal
of
their
native
land
was
too
distant
and
the
nearest
goal
the
one
towards
which
all
their
desires
and
hopes
increased
in
great
proportion
in
the
crowd
were
directedwas
smolensk
not
because
the
men
knew
that
there
were
abundant
provisions
and
fresh
troops
in
smolensk
not
because
they
were
told
so
on
the
contrary
the
higher
ranks
of
the
army
and
napoleon
himself
knew
that
there
were
few
provisions
there
but
because
that
alone
could
give
them
the
strength
to
move
and
to
endure
the
present
privations
they
both
those
who
knew
and
those
who
did
not
know
equally
deceiving
themselves
yearned
for
smolensk
as
for
the
promised
land
coming
out
onto
the
high
road
the
french
with
striking
energy
with
unheardof
speed
ran
towards
their
imagined
goal
besides
the
cause
of
a
general
yearning
that
bound
the
crowds
of
the
french
into
a
single
whole
and
endowed
them
with
a
certain
energy
there
was
yet
another
cause
that
bound
them
together
this
cause
consisted
in
their
numbers
their
enormous
mass
itself
as
in
the
physical
law
of
gravity
drew
the
separate
atoms
of
men
to
it
their
mass
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
moved
like
a
whole
state
each
man
of
them
desired
only
one
thingto
give
himself
up
as
a
prisoner
to
be
delivered
from
all
horrors
and
misfortunes
but
on
the
one
hand
the
force
of
their
general
yearning
towards
the
goal
of
smolensk
drew
each
of
them
in
one
and
the
same
direction
on
the
other
hand
it
was
impossible
for
a
corps
to
give
itself
up
to
a
company
and
though
the
french
used
every
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
each
other
and
on
every
decent
pretext
gave
themselves
up
as
prisoners
those
pretexts
did
not
always
occur
their
very
numbers
and
compact
quick
movement
deprived
them
of
that
possibility
and
made
it
not
only
difficult
but
impossible
for
the
russians
to
stop
that
movement
to
which
all
the
energy
of
the
mass
of
the
french
was
directed
beyond
a
certain
limit
the
mechanical
rending
of
the
body
could
not
hasten
the
ongoing
process
of
decomposition
it
is
impossible
to
melt
a
ball
of
snow
instantly
there
exists
a
certain
time
limit
before
which
no
efforts
at
heating
can
melt
the
snow
on
the
contrary
the
greater
the
heat
the
more
solid
the
remaining
snow
becomes
of
the
russian
military
leaders
no
one
but
kutuzov
understood
that
when
the
direction
of
the
flight
of
the
french
army
down
the
smolensk
road
became
definite
what
konovnitsyn
had
foreseen
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
october
began
to
come
true
all
the
higher
ranks
in
the
army
wanted
to
distinguish
themselves
to
cut
off
to
intercept
to
capture
to
overrun
the
french
and
they
all
called
for
an
offensive
kutuzov
alone
used
all
his
powers
those
powers
are
not
very
great
in
any
commander
in
chief
to
oppose
an
offensive
he
could
not
tell
them
what
we
say
now
why
battles
why
the
blocking
of
roads
and
the
loss
of
our
own
men
and
the
inhuman
finishing
off
of
the
unfortunate
why
all
that
when
from
moscow
to
vyazma
a
third
of
that
army
melted
away
without
any
battle
but
guided
by
his
old
mans
wisdom
he
told
them
what
they
could
understandhe
spoke
to
them
of
the
golden
bridge
and
they
laughed
at
him
slandered
him
stormed
and
raged
and
swaggered
over
the
slain
beast
at
vyazma
ermolov
miloradovich
platov
and
others
finding
themselves
in
proximity
to
the
french
could
not
restrain
their
desire
to
cut
off
and
overrun
two
french
corps
to
inform
kutuzov
of
their
intention
they
sent
him
an
envelope
containing
instead
of
a
message
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
however
much
kutuzov
tried
to
hold
the
troops
back
our
troops
attacked
trying
to
block
the
way
infantry
regiments
as
it
was
told
went
into
the
attack
with
music
and
beating
drums
and
destroyed
and
lost
thousands
of
men
but
as
for
cutting
offthey
cut
off
and
overran
nobody
and
the
french
army
having
drawn
up
more
tightly
in
the
face
of
danger
continued
melting
away
regularly
along
their
same
fatal
path
to
smolensk
i
the
battle
of
borodino
with
the
subsequent
occupation
of
moscow
by
the
french
and
their
flight
without
any
new
battles
is
one
of
the
most
instructive
phenomena
in
history
all
historians
agree
that
the
external
activity
of
states
and
nations
in
their
conflicts
among
themselves
is
expressed
in
wars
that
the
political
power
of
states
and
nations
increases
or
decreases
owing
directly
to
their
greater
or
lesser
military
successes
however
strange
the
historical
descriptions
of
how
some
king
or
emperor
having
quarreled
with
another
emperor
or
king
raised
an
army
fought
with
the
army
of
the
enemy
defeated
it
killed
three
five
ten
thousand
men
and
as
a
result
subjugated
a
state
and
a
whole
nation
of
several
millions
however
incomprehensible
the
reason
why
the
defeat
of
one
army
one
hundredth
of
all
the
forces
of
the
nation
made
the
nation
submitall
the
facts
of
history
insofar
as
it
is
known
to
us
confirm
the
correctness
of
the
statement
that
the
greater
or
lesser
successes
of
the
army
of
one
nation
against
the
army
of
another
nation
are
the
cause
or
at
least
the
essential
sign
of
an
increase
or
decrease
in
the
strength
of
the
nation
an
army
wins
a
victory
and
at
once
the
rights
of
the
victorious
nation
increase
to
the
detriment
of
the
vanquished
one
an
army
suffers
a
defeat
and
at
once
according
to
the
degree
of
the
defeat
the
nation
is
deprived
of
rights
and
in
case
of
a
total
defeat
of
their
army
is
totally
subjugated
so
it
has
been
according
to
history
from
the
most
ancient
times
to
the
present
all
the
wars
of
napoleon
serve
as
a
confirmation
of
this
rule
to
the
degree
that
the
austrian
army
is
defeated
austria
is
deprived
of
her
rights
and
the
rights
and
strength
of
france
increase
the
victories
of
the
french
at
jena
and
auerst228dt
destroy
the
independent
existence
of
prussia
but
suddenly
in
the
year
1812
the
french
win
a
victory
at
moscow
moscow
is
taken
and
following
that
with
no
new
battles
it
is
not
russia
that
ceases
to
exist
but
the
sixhundredthousandman
french
army
ceases
to
exist
and
after
that
napoleonic
france
to
stretch
the
facts
to
fit
the
rules
of
history
by
saying
that
the
battlefield
of
borodino
remained
russian
that
there
were
battles
after
moscow
which
destroyed
napoleons
armyis
impossible
after
the
victory
of
the
french
at
borodino
not
only
was
there
no
general
battle
but
there
was
even
none
in
any
way
significant
yet
the
french
army
ceased
to
exist
what
does
it
mean
if
it
was
an
example
from
the
history
of
china
we
might
say
that
it
was
not
a
historical
event
the
historians
loophole
when
something
does
not
fit
their
yardstick
if
it
was
a
matter
of
a
brief
clash
involving
a
small
number
of
troops
we
could
take
it
for
an
exceptional
phenomenon
but
this
event
took
place
before
the
eyes
of
our
fathers
for
whom
the
question
of
the
life
or
death
of
the
fatherland
was
decided
and
this
war
was
the
greatest
of
all
known
wars
the
period
in
the
campaign
of
1812
from
the
battle
of
borodino
to
the
expulsion
of
the
french
proved
that
a
battle
won
is
not
only
not
the
cause
of
a
conquest
but
is
not
even
an
invariable
sign
of
conquest
it
proved
that
the
force
that
decides
the
destiny
of
nations
lies
not
in
conquerors
not
even
in
armies
and
battles
but
in
something
else
french
historians
describing
the
situation
of
the
french
army
before
leaving
moscow
affirm
that
everything
in
the
grand
army
was
in
order
except
the
cavalry
the
artillery
and
the
transport
and
there
was
also
no
forage
to
feed
the
horses
and
cattle
there
was
no
help
for
this
calamity
because
the
muzhiks
of
the
region
burned
their
hay
rather
than
give
it
to
the
french
the
battle
won
did
not
bring
the
usual
results
because
the
muzhiks
karp
and
vlas
who
after
the
french
moved
on
came
to
moscow
with
their
carts
to
loot
the
city
and
in
general
did
not
manifest
any
personal
heroic
sentiments
and
all
the
countless
number
of
muzhiks
like
them
did
not
bring
hay
to
moscow
for
the
good
money
they
were
offered
but
burned
it
let
us
imagine
two
men
who
came
with
swords
to
fight
a
duel
by
all
the
rules
of
the
art
of
fencing
the
fighting
went
on
for
quite
a
long
time
suddenly
one
of
the
adversaries
feeling
himself
wounded
realizing
that
it
was
not
a
joking
matter
but
something
that
concerned
his
life
threw
down
his
sword
and
picking
up
the
first
club
he
found
started
brandishing
it
but
let
us
imagine
that
the
man
who
so
sensibly
employed
the
best
and
simplest
means
to
attain
his
goal
inspired
at
the
same
time
by
the
traditions
of
chivalry
wished
to
conceal
the
essence
of
the
matter
and
insisted
that
he
won
the
sword
fight
by
all
the
rules
of
the
art
one
can
imagine
what
confusion
and
obscurity
would
come
from
such
a
description
of
the
duel
that
took
place
the
french
were
the
fencer
who
demanded
a
fight
by
the
rules
of
the
art
the
russians
were
the
adversary
who
dropped
his
sword
and
picked
up
a
club
those
who
attempt
to
explain
everything
by
the
rules
of
fencing
are
the
historians
who
have
written
about
this
event
from
the
time
of
the
burning
of
smolensk
a
war
began
that
did
not
fit
any
of
the
former
traditions
of
war
the
burning
of
towns
and
villages
the
retreats
after
battles
the
blow
struck
at
borodino
and
then
another
retreat
the
abandoning
and
burning
of
moscow
the
hunt
for
marauders
the
cutting
off
of
transport
the
partisan
warthese
were
all
deviations
from
the
rules
napoleon
sensed
that
and
from
the
moment
when
he
stopped
in
moscow
in
the
correct
position
of
a
fencer
and
instead
of
his
adversarys
sword
saw
a
club
raised
over
him
he
never
ceased
complaining
to
kutuzov
and
the
emperor
alexander
that
the
war
was
being
conducted
against
all
the
rules
as
if
there
existed
some
sort
of
rules
for
killing
people
despite
the
complaints
of
the
french
about
the
nonfulfillment
of
the
rules
despite
the
fact
that
highly
placed
russians
thought
it
shameful
for
some
reason
to
fight
with
a
club
and
wanted
to
follow
the
rules
and
assume
a
position
en
quatre
or
en
tierce
make
a
skillful
thrust
en
prime
and
so
onthe
club
of
a
national
war
was
raised
with
all
its
terrible
and
majestic
power
and
not
asking
about
anyones
tastes
or
rules
with
stupid
simplicity
but
with
expediency
not
sorting
anything
out
rose
and
fell
and
hammered
on
the
french
until
the
whole
invasion
was
destroyed
and
blessed
is
that
nation
which
not
like
the
french
in
the
year
1813
who
saluted
by
all
the
rules
of
the
art
and
turning
the
sword
hilt
first
graciously
and
courteously
handed
it
to
the
magnanimous
victor
but
which
in
the
moment
of
trial
not
asking
how
others
have
acted
according
to
the
rules
on
such
occasions
simply
and
easily
raises
the
first
club
that
comes
along
and
hammers
with
it
until
the
feeling
of
outrage
and
revenge
in
its
soul
gives
place
to
contempt
and
pity
ii
one
of
the
most
palpable
and
advantageous
deviations
from
the
socalled
rules
of
war
is
the
action
of
scattered
people
against
people
pressed
together
in
a
mass
this
kind
of
action
always
emerges
in
a
war
that
acquires
a
national
character
these
actions
consist
in
the
fact
that
instead
of
a
crowd
opposing
a
crowd
people
scatter
attack
singly
and
flee
as
soon
as
large
forces
attack
them
then
attack
again
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
arises
this
was
done
by
the
guerrillas
in
spain
it
was
done
by
the
mountaineers
in
the
caucasus
it
was
done
by
the
russians
in
the
year
1812
warfare
of
this
kind
has
been
named
partisan
warfare
and
those
who
named
it
supposed
that
by
doing
so
they
were
explaining
its
meaning
yet
this
kind
of
warfare
not
only
does
not
fit
into
any
rules
but
is
directly
opposed
to
a
tactical
rule
that
is
wellknown
and
acknowledged
as
infallible
this
rule
says
that
an
attacker
should
concentrate
his
troops
in
order
to
be
stronger
at
the
moment
of
battle
partisan
warfare
always
successful
as
history
demonstrates
is
directly
opposed
to
this
rule
this
contradiction
proceeds
from
the
fact
that
military
science
assumes
the
strength
of
an
army
to
be
identical
with
its
numbers
military
science
says
that
the
bigger
the
army
the
stronger
it
is
les
gros
bataillons
ont
toujours
raison
in
saying
that
military
science
is
like
a
mechanics
which
considering
forces
only
in
relation
to
their
masses
would
say
that
forces
are
equal
or
not
equal
to
each
other
because
their
masses
are
or
are
not
equal
force
the
quantity
of
motion
is
the
product
of
mass
times
velocity
in
military
action
the
force
of
an
army
is
also
a
product
of
mass
times
something
some
unknown
x
military
science
seeing
from
a
countless
number
of
examples
in
history
that
the
mass
of
an
army
does
not
coincide
with
its
force
that
small
detachments
defeat
large
ones
vaguely
recognizes
the
existence
of
this
unknown
multiplier
and
tries
to
find
it
either
in
geometric
disposition
or
in
armaments
ormost
commonlyin
the
genius
of
the
commander
but
the
substitution
of
all
these
values
for
the
multiplier
does
not
produce
results
that
agree
with
the
historical
facts
and
yet
one
need
only
renounce
the
false
view
established
to
please
the
heroes
of
the
validity
of
orders
from
the
higher
powers
in
time
of
war
in
order
to
find
this
unknown
x
this
x
is
the
spirit
of
the
army
that
is
the
greater
or
lesser
desire
to
fight
and
subject
themselves
to
danger
on
the
all
the
men
who
make
up
the
army
regardless
of
whether
they
are
fighting
under
the
command
of
geniuses
or
not
in
three
lines
or
in
two
with
clubs
or
with
guns
that
fire
thirty
rounds
a
minute
men
who
have
the
greatest
desire
to
fight
will
always
put
themselves
in
the
most
advantageous
conditions
for
fighting
the
spirit
of
an
army
is
the
multiplier
of
the
mass
that
yields
the
product
of
force
to
determine
and
express
the
value
of
that
unknown
multiplier
the
spirit
of
an
army
is
the
task
of
science
this
task
is
possible
only
if
we
stop
arbitrarily
substituting
for
the
value
of
the
whole
unknown
x
the
conditions
under
which
force
is
manifestedto
wit
the
orders
of
the
commander
armaments
and
so
ontaking
them
for
the
value
of
the
multiplier
and
recognize
this
unknown
in
its
entirety
that
is
as
the
greater
or
lesser
desire
to
fight
and
subject
oneself
to
danger
only
then
expressing
known
historical
facts
in
equations
may
we
hope
by
comparing
the
relative
values
of
this
unknown
to
define
the
unknown
itself
ten
men
battalions
or
divisions
fighting
against
fifteen
men
battalions
or
divisions
defeated
the
fifteen
that
is
killed
or
captured
them
all
to
a
man
and
lost
four
themselves
thus
on
one
side
four
and
on
the
other
side
fifteen
were
cancelled
therefore
four
were
equal
to
fifteen
and
therefore
4x
15y
therefore
x
y
15
4
this
equation
does
not
give
us
the
value
of
the
unknown
but
it
gives
the
ratio
between
two
unknowns
and
by
bringing
various
historical
units
battles
campaigns
periods
of
war
into
such
equations
we
will
obtain
a
series
of
numbers
in
which
laws
should
exist
and
may
be
discovered
the
tactical
rule
that
there
should
be
massed
action
in
attack
and
dispersed
action
in
retreat
only
confirms
unwittingly
the
truth
that
the
strength
of
an
army
depends
on
its
spirit
to
lead
men
under
cannonballs
there
is
a
need
for
greater
discipline
achieved
only
by
mass
action
than
to
repulse
the
attackers
but
this
rule
which
loses
sight
of
the
spirit
of
the
army
always
proves
wrong
and
is
in
especially
flagrant
contradiction
to
reality
wherever
there
exists
a
strong
rise
or
fall
in
the
spirit
of
the
armyas
in
all
national
wars
the
french
retreating
in
1812
though
according
to
tactics
they
should
defend
themselves
separately
press
together
in
a
mass
because
the
spirit
of
the
army
has
fallen
and
only
its
mass
holds
the
army
together
the
russians
on
the
contrary
should
according
to
tactics
be
attacking
in
mass
but
in
fact
they
break
up
because
the
spirit
has
risen
so
much
that
separate
persons
beat
the
french
without
any
orders
and
need
not
be
forced
to
subject
themselves
to
difficulties
and
dangers
iii
the
socalled
partisan
war
began
with
the
entrance
of
the
enemy
into
smolensk
before
the
partisan
war
was
officially
accepted
by
our
government
thousands
of
men
of
the
enemy
armylingering
marauders
foragerswere
exterminated
by
the
cossacks
and
muzhiks
who
killed
these
men
off
as
unconsciously
as
dogs
bite
to
death
a
rabid
stray
dog
denis
davydov
with
his
russian
intuition
was
the
first
to
understand
the
meaning
of
that
terrible
club
which
without
inquiring
into
the
rules
of
military
art
was
destroying
the
french
and
to
him
belongs
the
glory
of
the
first
step
towards
legitimizing
this
method
of
warfare
on
the
twentyfourth
of
august
davydovs
first
partisan
detachment
was
formed
and
after
that
others
began
to
be
formed
the
further
the
campaign
moved
the
greater
the
number
of
these
detachments
grew
the
partisans
were
destroying
the
grand
army
piecemeal
they
gathered
up
the
dry
leaves
that
fell
by
themselves
from
the
withered
tree
of
the
french
army
and
occasionally
shook
that
tree
by
october
when
the
french
were
fleeing
towards
smolensk
there
were
hundreds
of
these
parties
of
various
sizes
and
characters
there
were
parties
that
imitated
all
the
methods
of
an
army
with
infantry
artillery
staffs
and
the
conveniences
of
life
there
were
some
of
cossacks
of
cavalry
there
were
small
combined
ones
foot
and
horse
there
were
peasants
and
landowners
parties
unknown
to
anyone
there
was
a
party
commanded
by
a
beadle
which
took
several
hundred
prisoners
in
a
month
there
was
vassilisa
a
village
headmans
wife
who
destroyed
hundreds
of
the
french
the
last
days
of
october
were
the
hottest
time
of
the
partisan
war
the
initial
period
of
this
wara
time
when
the
partisans
surprised
at
their
own
boldness
were
afraid
every
moment
of
being
caught
and
surrounded
by
the
french
and
hid
in
the
forest
without
unsaddling
their
horses
and
hardly
ever
dismounting
expecting
every
moment
to
be
pursuedhad
already
passed
now
this
war
was
already
defined
it
had
become
clear
to
everyone
what
could
and
could
not
be
undertaken
with
the
french
now
only
those
leaders
of
detachments
who
had
staffs
followed
rules
and
moved
about
at
a
distance
from
the
french
considered
many
things
impossible
the
small
partisan
groups
who
had
long
been
in
action
and
watched
the
french
from
closeup
considered
things
possible
that
the
leaders
of
large
detachments
did
not
dare
to
think
of
the
cossacks
and
the
peasants
who
got
in
among
the
french
considered
that
anything
was
now
possible
on
the
twentysecond
of
october
denisov
being
one
of
the
partisans
found
himself
with
his
party
in
the
very
heat
of
partisan
passion
he
and
his
party
had
been
on
the
move
since
morning
all
day
from
the
forest
stretching
along
the
high
road
he
had
been
watching
a
large
french
transport
of
cavalry
supplies
and
russian
prisoners
which
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
army
and
under
heavy
cover
as
was
known
from
scouts
and
prisoners
was
heading
for
smolensk
not
only
denisov
and
dolokhov
also
a
partisan
with
a
small
party
who
moved
about
close
to
denisov
but
the
leaders
of
large
detachments
with
staffs
as
wellall
of
them
knew
about
this
transport
and
as
denisov
said
were
whetting
their
teeth
for
it
two
of
these
large
detachment
leadersone
a
pole
the
other
a
germanalmost
simultaneously
sent
denisov
an
invitation
to
join
each
of
their
detachments
in
order
to
attack
the
transport
no
brother
ive
been
around
long
enough
said
denisov
having
read
these
papers
and
he
wrote
to
the
german
that
despite
his
heartfelt
wish
to
serve
under
the
command
of
such
a
valiant
and
famous
general
he
had
to
deprive
himself
of
that
happiness
because
he
had
already
put
himself
under
the
command
of
the
pole
to
the
polish
general
he
wrote
the
same
informing
him
that
he
had
already
put
himself
under
the
germans
command
having
arranged
things
in
this
way
denisov
together
with
dolokhov
intended
without
reporting
to
the
higher
command
to
attack
and
take
this
transport
with
their
own
small
forces
the
transport
was
going
on
the
twentysecond
of
october
from
the
village
of
mikulino
to
the
village
of
shamshevo
to
the
left
of
the
road
from
mikulino
to
shamshevo
there
were
big
forests
in
some
places
coming
right
down
to
the
road
in
some
moving
back
from
the
road
to
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
or
more
denisov
and
his
party
had
been
moving
through
these
forests
all
day
now
going
deep
into
the
middle
of
them
now
riding
out
into
the
open
not
losing
sight
of
the
moving
french
in
the
morning
not
far
from
mikulino
where
the
forest
came
close
to
the
road
cossacks
from
denisovs
party
had
captured
two
wagons
of
cavalry
saddles
that
were
bogged
down
in
the
mud
and
had
driven
them
into
the
forest
from
then
on
until
evening
the
party
without
attacking
had
followed
the
movement
of
the
french
they
had
without
frightening
them
to
let
them
go
peacefully
as
far
as
shamshevo
and
then
joining
up
with
dolokhov
who
was
to
arrive
by
evening
for
a
meeting
at
a
guardhouse
a
mile
from
shamshevo
to
fall
upon
them
at
dawn
out
of
the
blue
and
kill
or
capture
them
all
at
once
six
cossacks
were
left
behind
a
mile
and
a
half
from
mikulino
where
the
forest
came
right
down
to
the
road
who
were
to
inform
them
at
once
as
soon
as
new
french
columns
appeared
on
the
other
side
of
shamshevo
dolokhov
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
road
in
the
same
way
to
find
out
how
far
away
the
other
french
troops
were
there
were
supposed
to
be
fifteen
hundred
men
with
the
transport
denisov
had
two
hundred
men
dolokhov
might
rally
the
same
number
but
the
superiority
of
numbers
did
not
stop
denisov
there
was
only
one
thing
he
still
needed
to
know
which
was
precisely
what
sort
these
troops
were
for
that
purpose
denisov
needed
to
capture
a
tongue
that
is
a
soldier
from
the
enemy
column
in
the
morning
attack
on
the
wagons
the
business
had
been
done
with
such
haste
that
all
the
french
with
the
wagons
had
been
killed
and
the
only
one
taken
alive
was
a
drummer
boy
who
was
halfwitted
and
could
say
nothing
positive
about
what
sort
of
troops
were
with
the
column
denisov
considered
it
dangerous
to
attack
another
time
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
whole
column
and
therefore
he
sent
ahead
to
shamshevo
the
muzhik
tikhon
shcherbaty
who
was
in
his
party
to
capture
at
least
one
of
the
french
vanguard
who
were
taking
up
quarters
there
iv
it
was
a
warm
rainy
autumn
day
the
sky
and
the
horizon
were
both
the
color
of
muddy
water
now
the
fog
seemed
to
descend
now
a
slanting
rain
would
suddenly
come
down
in
big
drops
denisov
in
a
felt
cloak
and
a
papakha
streaming
with
water
rode
on
a
lean
purebred
horse
with
drawnin
flanks
like
his
horse
who
kept
moving
its
head
sideways
and
laying
its
ears
flat
he
winced
from
the
slanting
rain
and
peered
ahead
worriedly
his
emaciated
face
overgrown
with
a
thick
short
black
beard
looked
angry
beside
denisov
also
in
a
felt
cloak
and
papakha
on
a
big
wellnourished
don
stallion
rode
a
cossack
esaul
denisovs
associate
the
esaul
lovaisky
was
a
tall
whitefaced
fairhaired
man
flat
as
a
board
with
narrow
pale
eyes
and
a
calmly
smug
expression
in
his
face
and
bearing
though
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
made
for
the
peculiarity
of
the
horse
and
rider
from
a
first
glance
at
the
esaul
and
at
denisov
one
could
see
that
denisov
felt
wet
and
awkwardthat
he
was
a
man
sitting
on
a
horse
while
looking
at
the
esaul
one
could
see
that
he
felt
as
comfortable
and
at
ease
as
ever
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
sitting
on
a
horse
but
a
man
who
was
one
with
a
horse
a
being
of
twiceincreased
strength
a
little
ahead
of
them
walked
a
soaking
wet
little
peasanttheir
guidein
a
gray
kaftan
and
a
white
cap
a
little
behind
them
on
a
skinny
slender
kirghiz
nag
with
an
enormous
mane
and
tail
and
lips
so
torn
that
they
bled
rode
a
young
officer
in
a
dark
blue
french
greatcoat
beside
him
rode
a
hussar
with
a
boy
in
a
tattered
french
uniform
and
blue
cap
sitting
behind
him
on
his
horses
croup
the
boy
held
on
to
the
hussar
with
hands
red
from
the
cold
moved
his
bare
feet
in
an
effort
to
warm
them
and
raising
his
eyebrows
looked
around
in
surprise
this
was
the
french
drummer
boy
captured
in
the
morning
behind
by
threes
by
fours
along
the
narrow
sodden
and
muchtraveled
forest

stretched
hussars

some
in

some
in

greatcoats
some
with
horse

pulled
over
their
heads
the
horses
bay
and
sorrel
all
looked
black
from
the
rain
streaming
off
them
the
horses
necks
seemed
strangely
thin
because
of
their
drenched
manes
steam
rose
from
the
horses
clothes
saddles
reinseverything
was
wet
slippery
and
soggy
like
the
ground
and
the
fallen
leaves
that
covered
the
road
the
men
sat
looking
ruffled
up
trying
not
to
stir
so
as
to
keep
the
water
warm
that
had
seeped
through
to
the
body
and
not
let
in
the
new
cold
water
that
flowed
under
their
seats

and
behind
their
necks
between
the
strungout
cossacks

two
wagons
hitched
to

and
saddled

horses
rumbled
over
stumps
and
branches
and
gurgled
through
the
waterfilled
ruts
of
the
road
denisovs
horse
swerving
around
a
puddle
that
was
in
its
way
pulled
to
the
side
and
bumped
its
riders
knee
against
a
tree
ah
the
devil
denisov
cried
angrily
and
baring
his
teeth
he
gave
his
horse
three
strokes
of
the
whip
splashing
himself
and
his
comrades
with
mud
denisov
was
in
a
foul
mood
because
of
the
rain
and
because
he
was
hungry
no
one
had
eaten
anything
since
morning
and
above
all
because
there
was
no
word
from
dolokhov
and
the
man
sent
to
take
a
prisoner
had
not
come
back
there
could
hardly
be
another
such
occasion
as
today
for
attacking
the
transport
to
attack
alone
is
too
risky
but
put
it
off
to
another
day
and
some
bigger
party
will
snatch
the
booty
right
from
under
our
noses
thought
denisov
constantly
glancing
ahead
hoping
to
see
the
expected
messenger
from
dolokhov
emerging
into
a
clearing
where
one
could
see
far
to
the
right
denisov
stopped
somebodys
coming
he
said
the
esaul
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
denisov
was
pointing
there
are
two
comingan
officer
and
a
cossack
only
its
not
presupposable
that
its
the
lieutenant
colonel
himself
said
the
esaul
who
liked
to
use
words
unknown
to
the
cossacks
the
riders
descended
the
hill
disappeared
from
sight
and
reappeared
in
a
few
minutes
in
front
at
a
weary
gallop
applying
his
whip
rode
an
officerdisheveled
soaked
through
his
trousers
bunched
up
above
his
knees
behind
him
standing
in
the
stirrups
trotted
a
cossack
this
officer
a
very
young
boy
with
a
broad
redcheeked
face
and
quick
merry
eyes
galloped
up
to
denisov
and
handed
him
a
wet
envelope
from
the
general
said
the
officer
sorry
its
not
quite
dry
denisov
frowning
took
the
envelope
and
began
to
open
it
they
keep
saying
its
dangerous
dangerous
said
the
officer
turning
to
the
esaul
while
denisov
read
the
letter
handed
to
him
anyhow
me
and
komarov
he
pointed
to
the
cossack
are
ready
each
of
us
has
two
pistbut
whats
that
he
asked
seeing
the
french
drummer
boy
a
prisoner
youve
already
been
in
battle
can
i
talk
to
him
rostov
petya
denisov
cried
out
just
then
having
looked
through
the
envelope
handed
to
him
why
didnt
you
tell
me
who
you
were
and
denisov
turned
with
a
smile
and
gave
the
officer
his
hand
this
officer
was
petya
rostov
on
the
way
there
petya
had
been
preparing
the
way
he
as
a
grown
man
and
an
officer
without
hinting
at
their
former
acquaintance
would
behave
with
denisov
but
as
soon
as
denisov
smiled
at
him
petya
at
once
beamed
blushed
for
joy
and
forgetting
his
prepared
officialness
began
to
tell
how
he
had
ridden
past
the
french
and
how
glad
he
was
that
he
had
been
given
such
an
errand
and
that
he
had
already
been
in
battle
at
vyazma
and
that
a
certain
hussar
had
distinguished
himself
there
well
im
very
glad
to
see
you
denisov
interrupted
him
and
his
face
again
assumed
a
preoccupied
expression
mikhail
feoklitych
he
turned
to
the
esaul
this
one
is
from
the
german
again
hes
attached
to
him
and
denisov
told
the
esaul
that
the
content
of
the
letter
just
brought
consisted
of
a
repeated
request
to
join
him
in
attacking
the
transport
if
we
dont
take
it
tomorrow
theyll
snatch
it
from
under
our
noses
he
concluded
while
denisov
was
talking
with
the
esaul
petya
abashed
by
denisovs
cold
tone
and
supposing
that
the
cause
of
it
was
the
state
of
his
trousers
was
straightening
them
under
his
greatcoat
so
that
no
one
would
notice
trying
to
look
as
martial
as
possible
will
there
be
any
orders
from
your
honor
he
said
to
denisov
putting
his
hand
to
his
visor
and
returning
again
to
the
game
of
adjutant
and
general
which
he
had
prepared
for
or
shall
i
stay
with
your
honor
orders
denisov
said
pensively
but
can
you
stay
till
tomorrow
ah
pleasemay
i
stay
with
you
cried
petya
and
exactly
what
did
the
general
tell
youto
return
at
once
asked
denisov
petya
blushed
he
didnt
tell
me
anything
i
think
i
can
he
said
questioningly
well
all
right
said
denisov
and
turning
to
his
subordinates
he
gave
instructions
for
the
party
to
go
to
the
appointed
resting
place
by
the
guardhouse
in
the
forest
and
for
the
officer
on
the
kirghiz
horse
this
officer
functioned
as
an
adjutant
to
go
looking
for
dolokhov
to
find
out
where
he
was
and
whether
he
would
come
in
the
evening
denisov
himself
with
the
esaul
and
petya
intended
to
ride
up
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
that
came
out
at
shamshevo
in
order
to
look
over
the
place
where
the
french
were
camped
at
which
the
next
days
attack
should
be
directed
well
raybeard
he
turned
to
the
muzhik
guide
lead
us
to
shamshevo
denisov
petya
and
the
esaul
accompanied
by
several
cossacks
and
the
hussar
who
was
carrying
the
prisoner
rode
left
across
a
ravine
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
v
the
light
rain
stopped
only
mist
fell
and
drops
of
water
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
denisov
the
esaul
and
petya
silently
rode
after
the
muzhik
in
the
cap
who
stepping
lightly
and
noiselessly
over
the
roots
and
wet
leaves
with
his
splayed
feet
in
bast
shoes
led
them
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
going
up
a
slope
the
muzhik
paused
looked
around
and
made
for
the
thinning
wall
of
trees
by
a
big
oak
still
covered
with
leaves
he
stopped
and
beckoned
mysteriously
with
his
hand
denisov
and
petya
rode
up
to
him
from
the
place
where
the
muzhik
had
stopped
the
french
could
be
seen
just
beyond
the
forest
a
field
of
spring
wheat
descended
over
a
low
knoll
to
the
right
across
a
steep
ravine
a
small
village
and
a
manor
house
with
brokendown
roofs
could
be
seen
in
this
village
and
in
the
manor
house
and
all
over
the
knoll
in
the
garden
by
the
wells
and
the
pond
and
along
the
road
uphill
from
the
bridge
to
the
village
no
more
than
four
hundred
yards
away
crowds
of
men
could
be
seen
through
the
undulating
mist
one
could
clearly
hear
their
nonrussian
shouts
at
the
horses
pulling
wagons
up
the
hill
and
their
calls
to
one
another
bring
the
prisoner
here
denisov
said
in
a
low
voice
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
french
the
cossack
got
off
his
horse
took
the
boy
down
and
went
up
to
denisov
with
him
denisov
pointing
to
the
french
asked
what
kind
of
troops
these
and
those
were
the
boy
putting
his
chilled
hands
in
his
pockets
and
raising
his
eyebrows
looked
at
denisov
in
fear
and
despite
his
obvious
wish
to
tell
all
he
knew
became
confused
in
his
answers
and
only
confirmed
whatever
denisov
asked
denisov
frowned
turned
away
from
him
and
addressed
the
esaul
telling
him
his
considerations
petya
quickly
turning
his
head
looked
now
at
the
drummer
boy
now
at
denisov
now
at
the
esaul
now
at
the
french
in
the
village
and
on
the
road
trying
not
to
miss
anything
important
whether
dolokhov
comes
or
not
weve
got
to
take
themright
said
denisov
with
a
merry
sparkle
in
his
eyes
its
a
convenient
place
said
the
esaul
well
send
the
infantry
from
below
through
the
marshes
denisov
went
on
theyll
sneak
up
on
the
garden
you
and
the
cossacks
will
ride
around
from
there
denisov
pointed
to
the
forest
behind
the
village
and
ill
come
from
here
with
my
hussars
and
at
the
signal
shot
we
cant
go
through
the
hollowits
swampy
said
the
esaul
the
horses
will
get
bogged
down
well
have
to
go
around
more
to
the
left
as
they
were
talking
like
that
in
half
whispers
a
shot
cracked
below
in
the
hollow
by
the
pond
they
saw
a
puff
of
white
smoke
then
another
and
heard
the
concerted
merrysounding
shout
of
hundreds
of
voices
of
the
french
who
were
on
the
hillside
at
the
first
moment
denisov
and
the
esaul
drew
back
they
were
so
close
that
they
thought
they
were
the
cause
of
the
shots
and
shouts
but
the
shots
and
shouts
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
below
across
the
marsh
ran
a
man
in
something
red
obviously
the
french
were
shooting
and
shouting
at
him
why
thats
our
tikhon
said
the
esaul
him
its
him
what
a
rascal
said
denisov
hell
get
away
the
esaul
said
narrowing
his
eyes
the
man
they
called
tikhon
ran
to
the
river
plopped
into
it
with
a
splash
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
clambered
out
on
all
fours
black
from
the
water
and
ran
on
the
french
who
were
running
after
him
stopped
thats
nimble
said
the
esaul
what
a
rogue
denisov
said
with
the
same
expression
of
vexation
whats
he
been
up
to
all
this
time
who
is
he
asked
petya
our
plastun
i
sent
him
to
take
a
tongue
ah
yes
said
petya
nodding
his
head
at
denisovs
first
words
as
if
he
understood
everything
though
he
decidedly
did
not
understand
a
single
word
tikhon
shcherbaty
was
one
of
the
most
necessary
men
in
the
party
he
was
a
muzhik
from
pokrovskoe
near
gzhat
when
at
the
beginning
of
his
operations
denisov
had
come
to
pokrovskoe
and
as
usual
summoned
the
headman
and
asked
what
they
knew
about
the
french
the
headman
had
answered
as
all
headmen
would
as
if
defending
himself
that
he
knew
nothing
had
seen
nothing
but
when
denisov
explained
that
his
aim
was
to
kill
the
french
and
asked
whether
the
french
had
happened
to
come
there
the
headman
said
that
in
fact
some
marowders
had
been
there
but
that
in
their
village
only
gaptoothed
tishka
concerned
himself
with
such
doings
denisov
told
him
to
summon
tikhon
and
having
praised
him
for
his
activity
said
a
few
words
in
front
of
the
headman
about
loyalty
to
the
tsar
and
the
fatherland
and
the
hatred
for
the
french
that
the
sons
of
the
fatherland
should
observe
we
do
no
harm
to
the
french
said
tikhon
clearly
cowed
by
these
words
of
denisovs
we
just
went
hunting
and
had
some
fun
with
the
lads
we
did
kill
some
couple
of
dozen
marowders
but
otherwise
we
did
no
harm
the
next
day
when
denisov
forgetting
entirely
about
this
muzhik
left
pokrovskoe
it
was
reported
to
him
that
tikhon
had
attached
himself
to
the
party
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
stay
with
it
denisov
said
he
could
stay
tikhon
who
at
first
did
the
dirty
work
of
making
campfires
carrying
water
skinning
horses
and
so
on
soon
showed
great
zeal
and
ability
for
partisan
warfare
at
night
he
went
after
booty
and
came
back
each
time
bringing
some
french
clothing
or
weapons
and
when
told
to
also
brought
in
prisoners
denisov
relieved
tikhon
from
work
began
taking
him
with
him
on
patrol
and
enlisted
him
as
a
cossack
tikhon
did
not
like
riding
and
always
went
on
foot
never
lagging
behind
the
cavalry
his
weapons
were
a
musketoon
which
he
strapped
on
mainly
for
amusement
a
pike
and
an
ax
which
he
used
as
a
wolf
does
its
teeth
with
equal
ease
picking
fleas
out
of
its
fur
or
biting
through
thick
bones
tikhon
with
equal
precision
would
swing
his
ax
to
split
logs
or
taking
it
by
the
butt
whittle
thin
pegs
or
carved
spoons
in
denisovs
party
tikhon
occupied
his
own
exceptional
place
when
there
was
a
need
to
do
something
especially
difficult
and
nastyto
haul
a
cart
out
of
the
mud
with
ones
shoulder
to
pull
a
horse
out
of
a
swamp
by
its
tail
or
skin
it
to
slip
right
into
the
middle
of
the
french
to
walk
thirty
miles
a
dayeveryone
pointed
chuckling
at
tikhon
what
harm
will
it
do
the
devilhes
sturdy
as
an
ox
they
said
of
him
once
a
frenchman
tikhon
was
about
to
capture
shot
at
him
with
a
pistol
and
hit
him
in
the
soft
hindquarters
this
wound
which
tikhon
treated
only
with
vodka
internally
and
externally
was
the
object
of
the
merriest
jokes
in
the
whole
party
jokes
to
which
tikhon
willingly
yielded
never
again
eh
brother
all
doubled
up
the
cossacks
laughed
at
him
and
tikhon
doubling
up
on
purpose
and
making
faces
pretending
to
be
angry
denounced
the
french
with
the
funniest
oaths
the
only
influence
this
incident
had
on
tikhon
was
that
after
his
wound
he
rarely
brought
in
prisoners
tikhon
was
the
bravest
and
most
useful
man
in
the
party
nobody
found
more
chances
for
attacking
than
he
no
one
captured
or
killed
more
of
the
french
and
as
a
result
of
that
he
was
a
buffoon
for
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
and
willingly
accepted
that
rank
now
tikhon
had
been
sent
by
denisov
to
shamshevo
during
the
night
in
order
to
take
a
tongue
but
either
because
he
was
not
satisfied
with
one
prisoner
or
because
he
had
slept
through
the
night
he
had
slipped
by
day
into
some
bushes
right
in
the
middle
of
the
french
and
as
denisov
had
seen
from
the
hill
had
been
discovered
by
them
vi
having
talked
a
while
longer
with
the
esaul
about
the
next
days
attack
which
denisov
seeing
the
closeness
of
the
french
now
seemed
to
have
definitively
resolved
upon
he
turned
his
horse
and
rode
back
well
brother
now
lets
go
and
get
dry
he
said
to
petya
riding
up
to
the
forest
guardhouse
denisov
stopped
peering
into
the
forest
in
the
forest
among
the
trees
a
man
was
walking
with
big
light
strides
on
long
legs
with
long
swinging
arms
wearing
a
jacket
bast
shoes
and
a
kazan
hat
with
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
an
ax
in
his
belt
seeing
denisov
this
man
hastily
flung
something
into
the
bushes
and
taking
off
his
soaked
hat
with
its
drooping
brim
went
up
to
his
commander
it
was
tikhon
his
pockmarked
and
wrinkled
face
with
its
small
narrow
eyes
beamed
with
selfsatisfied
merriment
raising
his
head
high
and
as
if
trying
to
keep
from
laughing
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
denisov
well
where
did
you
disappear
to
said
denisov
disappear
to
i
went
after
the
french
tikhon
replied
boldly
and
quickly
in
a
hoarse
but
melodious
bass
why
did
you
slip
in
there
during
the
day
brute
so
you
didnt
take
i
took
one
i
did
said
tikhon
where
is
he
i
took
him
first
thing
at
dawn
tikhon
went
on
moving
his
flat
splayed
feet
in
their
bast
shoes
further
apart
and
i
led
him
into
the
forest
i
saw
he
wasnt
the
right
sort
i
thought
why
dont
i
go
and
take
another
more
proper
one
see

a
rascal
thats
what
denisov
said
to
the
esaul
why
didnt
you
bring
that
one
why

tikhon
interrupted
crossly
and
quickly
if
hes
no
good
dont
i
know
what
kind
you
need
sly
dogso
i
went
after
another
tikhon
continued
i
crawled
into
the
forest
like
this
and
lay
there
tikhon
unexpectedly
and
nimbly
lay
on
his
belly
acting
out
how
he
had
done
it
one
of
them
came
along
he
continued
i
grabbed
him
like
this
tikhon
jumped
up
quickly
and
lightly
lets
go
to
the
colonel
i
said
he
started
jabbering
four
of
them
came
fell
on
me
with
their
little
swords
i
swung
my
ax
like
this
come
on
christ
help
you
tikhon
cried
swinging
his
arms
scowling
terribly
and
thrusting
out
his
chest
we
saw
from
the
hill
how
you
cut
and
ran
through
the
puddles
said
the
esaul
narrowing
his
bright
eyes
petya
wanted
very
much
to
laugh
but
he
saw
that
they
all
kept
from
laughing
he
quickly
shifted
his
gaze
from
tikhons
face
to
the
esauls
and
denisovs
not
understanding
what
it
all
meant
dont
play
the
fool
said
denisov
coughing
crossly
why
didnt
you
bring
the
first
one
tikhon
began
to
scratch
his
back
with
one
hand
his
head
with
the
other
and
suddenly
his
whole
mug
stretched
into
a
beaming
foolish
smile
revealing
the
missing
tooth
for
which
he
was
nicknamed
shcherbatygaptoothed
denisov
smiled
and
petya
dissolved
in
merry
laughter
in
which
tikhon
himself
joined
no
but
he
was
all
wrong
said
tikhon
such
poor
clothes
on
him
there
was
no
point
bringing
him
here
and
a
crude
one
your
honor
its
like
this
he
says
im
a
ginnerals
son
i
wont
go
he
says
what
a
brute
said
denisov
i
need
to
question
but
i
did
ask
him
said
tikhon
things

saysin

lot

says

in
poor
shape
just
in
name
only

says

good
whack

says
and
youll
take
them
all
tikhon
concluded
glancing
merrily
and
resolutely
into
denisovs
eyes
when
you
get
a
hundred
hot
ones
from
me
thatll
teach
you
to
play
the
fool
denisov
said
sternly
why
get
angry
said
tikhon
as
if
i
havent
seen
your
frenchmen
wait
till
it
gets
dark
ill
bring
you
any
sort
you
like
even
three
of
them
well
lets
go
said
denisov
and
rode
on
until
they
came
to
the
guardhouse
silent
and
frowning
angrily
tikhon
walked
behind
and
petya
heard
the
cossacks
laughing
with
him
and
at
him
about
some
boots
he
had
thrown
into
the
bushes
when
the
laughter
that
came
over
him
at
tikhons
words
and
smile
passed
and
petya
realized
for
a
moment
that
this
tikhon
had
killed
a
man
he
felt
uneasy
he
glanced
at
the
captive
drummer
boy
and
something
stabbed
his
heart
but
this
uneasiness
lasted
only
a
moment
he
felt
a
need
to
raise
his
head
higher
to
encourage
himself
and
to
question
the
esaul
about
the
next
days
undertaking
assuming
a
significant
air
so
as
not
to
be
unworthy
of
the
company
he
was
in
the
officer
who
had
been
sent
met
denisov
on
the
way
with
the
news
that
dolokhov
himself
would
come
at
once
and
that
for
his
was
well
denisov
suddenly
cheered
up
and
called
petya
to
him
well
tell
me
about
yourself
he
said
vii
petya
having
left
his
family
on
their
departure
from
moscow
had
joined
his
regiment
and
soon
after
that
was
attached
as
an
orderly
to
a
general
in
command
of
a
large
detachment
since
the
time
of
his
promotion
to
officer
and
especially
since
going
on
active
duty
where
he
had
taken
the
battle
of
vyazma
petya
had
constantly
been
in
a
state
of
happily
excited
joy
that
he
was
grown
up
and
in
constantly
rapturous
haste
not
to
miss
any
occasion
for
real
heroism
he
was
very
happy
with
what
he
had
seen
and
experienced
in
the
army
but
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
him
all
the
time
that
he
was
not
where
what
was
most
real
and
heroic
was
now
happening
and
he
hurried
to
get
where
he
was
not
when
on
the
twentyfirst
of
october
his
general
expressed
the
wish
to
send
someone
to
denisovs
detachment
petya
begged
so
pitifully
to
be
sent
that
the
general
could
not
refuse
but
as
he
was
sending
him
the
general
recalling
petyas
mad
behavior
at
the
battle
of
vyazma
where
instead
of
taking
to
the
road
and
going
where
he
had
been
sent
he
had
galloped
into
the
line
under
french
fire
and
there
twice
shot
off
his
pistolas
he
was
sending
him
the
general
precisely
forbade
petya
to
take
any
of
denisovs
actions
whatever
it
was
this
that
had
made
petya
blush
and
become
confused
when
denisov
asked
if
he
could
stay
until
he
rode
out
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
petya
thought
that
in
strict
fulfillment
of
his
duty
he
ought
to
return
at
once
but
when
he
saw
the
french
saw
tikhon
learned
that
there
would
certainly
be
an
attack
in
the
night
he
with
a
young
mans
quickness
in
changing
his
views
decided
to
himself
that
his
general
whom
till
then
he
had
respected
very
much
was
trash
a
german
that
denisov
was
a
hero
and
the
esaul
was
a
hero
and
tikhon
was
a
hero
and
it
was
shameful
to
leave
them
at
a
difficult
moment
night
was
already
falling
when
denisov
with
petya
and
the
esaul
rode
up
to
the
guardhouse
in
the
semidarkness
they
could
see
saddled
horses
cossacks
hussars
setting
up
little
leantos
in
the
clearing
and
making
a
glowing
fire
in
the
wooded
ravine
so
that
the
french
would
not
see
the
smoke
in
the
front
hall
of
the
small
cottage
a
cossack
his
sleeves
rolled
up
was
carving
mutton
inside
the
cottage
itself
three
officers
from
denisovs
party
were
setting
up
a
table
made
from
a
door
petya
took
off
his
wet
things
handed
them
over
to
be
dried
and
at
once
began
to
assist
the
officers
in
setting
up
the
dinner
table
ten
minutes
later
the
table
was
ready
covered
with
a
cloth
on
the
table
stood
vodka
a
flask
of
rum
white
bread
and
roast
mutton
with
salt
sitting
with
the
officers
at
the
table
and
tearing
at
a
greasy
hunk
of
fragrant
mutton
with
his
hands
which
dripped
with
fat
petya
was
in
a
rapturous
childlike
state
of
tender
love
for
all
people
and
consequently
of
certainty
that
other
people
had
the
same
love
for
him
so
what
do

think
vassily
fyodorovich
he
turned
to
denisov
is
it
all
right
if

with
you
for
one
little
day
and
not
waiting
for

answered
himself

and
looked
around

his
raised
head
and
swinging
his
arms
to
the
main
denisov
repeated
smiling
only

petya
went
on
what
is
it
to
you
ah

knife
he
turned
to
an
officer
who
wanted
to
cut
some
mutton
and
he
gave
him
his
pocketknife
the
officer
praised
the
knife
keep
it
please
ive

petya
said
blushing
good
heavens
i
completely
forgot
he
suddenly
cried

petya
ran
to
the
front
hall
to
his
cossack
and
brought
back
bags
with
some
five
pounds
of
raisins
eat
gentlemen

he

to
the
esaul
i
bought

its

he

and
hes
very
honest

a
hundred
flints
i
bought
them
very
cheap
please
take
as
many
as
you
like
or
even
all
of
them
and
suddenly
afraid
that
he
had
let
his
tongue
run
away
with
him
petya
stopped
and
blushed
he
began
to
recall
whether
he
had
done
any
other
stupid
things
and
going
through
his
memories
of
that
day
he
stopped
at
the
memory
of
the
french
drummer
boy
its
fine
for
us
but
how
about
him
where
have
they
put
him
have
they
fed
him
have
they
mistreated
him
he
thought
but
realizing
that
he
had
gotten
carried
away
with
the
flints
he
was
now
wary
i
could
ask
he
thought
but
theyll
say
hes
a
boy
himself
and
he
feels
sorry
for
a
boy
ill
show
them
tomorrow
what
sort
of
boy
i
am
will
it
be
shameful
if
i
ask
thought
petya
well
what
difference
does
it
makeand
at
once
blushing
and
looking
fearfully
at
the
officers
to
see
if
there
was
any
mockery
in
their
faces
he
said
and
can
i
call
that
boy
you
captured
to
give
him
something
to
eatmaybe
yes
a
pitiful
lad
said
denisov
obviously
finding
nothing
shameful
in
this
reminder
call
him
here
his
names
vincent
bosse
call
him
ill
call
him
said
petya
call
him
call
him
a
pitiful
lad
denisov
repeated
petya
was
standing
by
the
door
when
denisov
said
that
he
squeezed
between
the
officers
and
went
up
close
to
denisov
allow
me
to
kiss
you
dear
heart
he
said
ah
how
excellent
how
good
and
having
kissed
denisov
he
ran
outside
bosse
vincent
cried
petya
stopping
by
the
door
who
do
you
want
sir
a
voice
said
from
the
darkness
petya
replied
that
it
was
the
french
boy
who
had
been
captured
that
day
ah
vesenny
said
a
cossack
his
name
vincent
had
already
been
changed
into
vesenny
by
the
cossacks
into
visenya
by
the
muzhiks
and
soldiers
both
changes
brought
together
a
reminder
of
springtime
with
the
idea
of
a
young
boy
he
was
warming
up
by
the
fire
hey
visenya
visenya
vesenny
echoing
voices
and
laughter
were
heard
in
the
darkness
hes
a
sharp
little
lad
said
a
hussar
who
was
standing
by
petya
we
gave
him
something
to
eat
earlier
he
was
dying
of
hunger
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
darkness
and
the
drummer
boy
splashing
barefoot
through
the
mud
came
up
to
the
door
ah
cest
vous
said
petya
voulezvous
manger
nayez
pas
peur
on
ne
vous
fera
pas
de
mal
he
added
touching
his
hand
timidly
and
tenderly
entrez
entrez
merci
monsieur
the
drummer
boy
replied
in
a
trembling
voice
almost
a
childs
and
began
wiping
his
muddy
feet
on
the
threshold
petya
would
have
liked
to
say
many
things
to
the
drummer
boy
but
he
did
not
dare
he
stood
beside
him
in
the
front
hall
shifting
from
foot
to
foot
then
he
took
his
hand
in
the
darkness
and
pressed
it
entrez
entrez
he
only
repeated
in
a
tender
whisper
ah
what
can
i
do
for
him
petya
said
to
himself
and
opening
the
door
he
let
the
boy
go
in
past
him
when
the
drummer
boy
had
entered
the
cottage
petya
sat
down
at
some
distance
from
him
considering
that
it
was
humiliating
for
him
to
pay
attention
to
him
he
only
felt
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
wondered
whether
it
would
be
shameful
for
him
to
give
it
to
the
drummer
boy
viii
from
the
drummer
boy
who
on
denisovs
instructions
was
given
vodka
and
mutton
and
whom
denisov
ordered
dressed
in
a
russian
kaftan
so
that
he
could
stay
with
the
party
and
not
be
sent
away
with
the
prisoners
petyas
attention
was
distracted
by
the
arrival
of
dolokhov
in
the
army
petya
had
heard
many
stories
of
dolokhovs
extraordinary
courage
and
cruelty
to
the
french
and
therefore
once
dolokhov
entered
the
cottage
petya
gazed
at
him
without
taking
his
eyes
away
and
kept
encouraging
himself
by
tossing
his
raised
head
so
as
not
to
be
unworthy
even
of
such
company
as
dolokhov
dolokhovs
appearance
struck
petya
strangely
by
its
simplicity
denisov
was
dressed
in
a
cossack
coat
wore
a
beard
and
an
icon
of
st
nicholas
the
wonderworker
on
his
chest
and
in
his
manner
of
speaking
in
all
his
ways
expressed
the
singularity
of
his
position
dolokhov
on
the
contrary
who
formerly
in
moscow
had
worn
persian
dress
now
had
the
look
of
a
most
prim
officer
of
the
guards
his
face
was
cleanshaven
he
was
dressed
in
a
padded
guardsmans
jacket
with
a
st
george
in
the
buttonhole
and
in
a
simple
peaked
cap
set
straight
on
his
head
he
took
off
his
wet
felt
cape
in
the
corner
and
going
up
to
denisov
without
greeting
anyone
at
once
began
asking
him
about
business
denisov
told
him
about
the
designs
that
the
large
detachments
had
on
their
transport
about
the
sending
of
petya
and
about
his
response
to
the
two
generals
then
denisov
told
him
all
he
knew
about
the
position
of
the
french
thats
all
very
well
but
we
must
know
what
kind
of
troops
they
are
and
how
many
said
dolokhov
well
have
to
go
there
we
cant
go
into
action
without
knowing
for
certain
how
many
they
are
i
like
to
do
things
neatly
so
gentlemen
does
anyone
want
to
go
with
me
to
their
camp
ive
got
uniforms
with
me
me
meill
go
with
you
cried
petya
theres
no
need
at
all
for
you
to
go
said
denisov
addressing
dolokhov
and
him
i
wont
let
go
for
anything
thats
just
fine
cried
petya
why
cant
i
go
because
theres
no
need
well
excuse
me
becausebecauseim
going
thats
all
will
you
take
me
he
turned
to
dolokhov
why
not
dolokhov
answered
distractedly
peering
into
the
face
of
the
french
drummer
boy
have
you
had
this
little
fellow
long
he
asked
denisov
we
took
him
today
but
he
doesnt
know
anything
im
keeping
him
with
me
and
where
do
the
rest
disappear
to
asked
dolokhov
meaning
what
i
send
them
off
and
take
receipts
denisov
cried
suddenly
turning
red
and
i
say
boldly
that
i
dont
have
a
single
man
on
my
conscience
is
it
hard
for
you
to
send
thirty
or
even
three
hundred
men
to
town
under
escort
insteadill
say
it
outrightinstead
of
besmihrching
the
honor
of
a
soldier
such
niceties
would
be
fitting
for
the
little
sixteenyearold
count
here
dolokhov
said
with
a
cold
smirk
but
its
time
you
gave
them
up
what
im
not
saying
anything
im
only
saying
that
ill
definitely
go
with
you
petya
said
timidly
but
for
you
and
me
brother
its
time
to
drop
these
niceties
dolokhov
went
on
as
if
he
found
a
special
pleasure
in
talking
about
this
subject
which
irritated
denisov
now
why
have
you
taken
this
one
with
you
he
said
shaking
his
head
because
you
feel
sorry
for
him
we
know
those
receipts
of
yours
you
send
off
a
hundred
men
thirty
will
arrive
the
rest
will
starve
to
death
or
be
killed
does
it
make
any
difference
if
you
dont
take
them
the
esaul
narrowing
his
pale
eyes
nodded
approvingly
that
makes
no
difference
theres
nothing
to
discuss
i
dont
want
to
take
it
on
my
soul
you
say
theyll
die
very
well
as
long
as
its
not
because
of
me
dolokhov
laughed
who
told
them
not
to
capture
me
twenty
times
over
but
if
they
dofor
me
and
for
you
with
all
your
chivalry
its
the
same
aspen
tree
he
paused
anyhow
weve
got
to
get
down
to
business
send
for
my
cossack
with
the
bundle
i
have
two
french
uniforms
well
are
you
coming
with
me
he
asked
petya
me
yes
yes
definitely
cried
petya
blushing
almost
to
the
point
of
tears
and
glancing
at
denisov
while
dolokhov
was
arguing
with
denisov
about
what
to
do
with
the
prisoners
petya
had
again
felt
uneasy
and
hurried
but
again
he
had
not
quite
managed
to
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
if
the
big
famous
ones
think
like
that
it
means
it
must
be
so
it
means
its
good
he
thought
and
above
all
denisov
mustnt
think
that
ill
obey
him
that
he
can
command
me
ill
definitely
go
to
the
french
camp
with
dolokhov
if
he
can
i
can
to
all
denisovs
persuasions
not
to
go
petya
replied
that
he
was
also
used
to
doing
everything
neatly
and
not
any
old
way
and
that
he
never
thought
about
the
danger
to
himself
becauseyou
yourself
will
agreeif
we
dont
know
for
certain
how
many
there
are
the
lives
of
hundreds
may
depend
on
it
and
here
its
just
us
and
i
also
want
it
very
much
and
ill
definitely
go
i
will
you
wont
hold
me
back
he
said
that
will
only
be
worse
ix
having
put
on
french
uniforms
and
shakos
petya
and
dolokhov
rode
to
the
clearing
from
which
denisov
had
looked
at
the
camp
and
riding
out
of
the
forest
in
total
darkness
descended
into
the
hollow
on
reaching
the
bottom
dolokhov
told
the
cossacks
who
accompanied
them
to
wait
there
and
rode
at
a
sturdy
trot
down
the
road
to
the
bridge
petya
his
heart
thrilling
with
excitement
rode
beside
him
if
were
caught
i
wont
surrender
alive
ive
got
a
pistol
petya
whispered
dont
speak
russian
dolokhov
said
in
a
quick
whisper
and
at
the
same
moment
they
heard
a
call
from
the
darkness
qui
vive
and
the
cocking
of
a
musket
the
blood
rushed
to
petyas
face
and
he
gripped
his
pistol
lanciers
du

said
dolokhov
without
slowing
or
increasing
the
pace
of
his
horse
the
black
figure
of
the
sentry
stood
on
the
bridge
mot
dordre
dolokhov
reined
in
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
dites
donc
le
colonel
g233rard
est
ici
he
said
mot
dordre
the
sentry
said
without
replying
and
barred
his
way
quand
un
officier
fait
sa
ronde
les
sentinelles
ne
demandent
pas
le
mot
dordre
cried
dolokhov
suddenly
flaring
up
and
riding
his
horse
into
the
sentry
je
vous
demande
si
le
colonel
est
ici
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
from
the
sentry
who
stepped
aside
dolokhov
rode
up
the
hill
at
a
walk
noticing
the
black
shadow
of
a
man
crossing
the
road
dolokhov
stopped
him
and
asked
where
the
commander
and
the
officers
were
this
man
with
a
sack
on
his
back
a
soldier
stopped
came
up
close
to
dolokhovs
horse
touched
it
with
his
hand
and
told
him
simply
and
amicably
that
the
commander
and
the
officers
were
further
up
the
hill
to
the
right
in
the
courtyard
of
the
farmhouse
as
he
called
the
manor
house
riding
up
the
road
from
both
sides
of
which
came
the
sounds
of
french
talk
around
the
campfires
dolokhov
turned
into
the
courtyard
of
the
manor
house
riding
through
the
gates
he
got
off
his
horse
and
went
up
to
a
big
blazing
campfire
around
which
several
men
sat
talking
loudly
in
a
pot
at
the
edge
of
the
fire
something
was
cooking
and
a
soldier
in
a
cap
and
blue
uniform
on
his
knees
brightly
lit
up
by
the
fire
was
stirring
it
with
a
ramrod
oh
cest
un
dur
224
cuire
said
one
of
the
officers
sitting
in
the
shadow
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
il
les
fera
marcher
les
lapins
another
said
laughing
they
both
fell
silent
peering
into
the
darkness
at
the
sound
of
dolokhovs
and
petyas
footsteps
as
they
approached
the
fire
with
their
horses
bonjour
messieurs
dolokhov
said
loudly
and
distinctly
the
officers
stirred
in
the
shadow
of
the
fire
and
one
a
tall
officer
with
a
long
neck
went
up
to
dolokhov
cest
vous
cl233ment
he
said
do249
diable
but
he
did
not
finish
realizing
his
mistake
and
frowning
slightly
greeted
dolokhov
as
a
stranger
asking
what
he
could
do
for
him
dolokhov
told
him
that
he
and
his
comrade
were
trying
to
catch
up
with
their
regiment
and
asked
addressing
them
all
in
general
whether
the
officers
knew
anything
about
the
sixth
regiment
no
one
knew
anything
and
petya
thought
that
the
officers
were
beginning
to
look
at
him
and
dolokhov
with
animosity
and
suspicion
for
a
few
seconds
they
were
all
silent
si
vous
comptez
sur
la
soupe
du
soir
vous
venez
trop
tard
a
voice
said
from
behind
the
fire
with
restrained
laughter
dolokhov
replied
that
they
were
not
hungry
and
had
to
be
on
their
way
that
night
he
handed
the
horses
to
the
soldier
who
was
stirring
the
pot
and
squatted
by
the
fire
next
to
the
officer
with
the
long
neck
this
officer
not
taking
his
eyes
off
dolokhov
asked
again
what
regiment
he
was
from
dolokhov
did
not
reply
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
question
and
lighting
up
a
short
french
pipe
that
he
took
from
his
pocket
asked
the
officers
how
far
the
road
ahead
was
safe
from
cossacks
les
brigands
sont
partout
replied
the
officer
from
behind
the
fire
dolokhov
said
that
cossacks
were
only
a
fear
for
stray
ones
like
him
and
his
comrade
but
added
questioningly
that
they
probably
did
not
dare
to
attack
large
detachments
no
one
made
any
reply
well
now
hell
leave
petya
kept
thinking
every
moment
standing
before
the
fire
and
listening
to
his
conversation
but
dolokhov
began
the
stalled
conversation
again
and
started
asking
directly
how
many
men
were
in
their
battalion
how
many
battalions
how
many
prisoners
asking
about
the
russian
prisoners
who
were
with
their
detachment
dolokhov
said
la
vilaine
affaire
de
trainer
ces
cadavres
apr232s
soi
vaudrait
mieux
fusiller
cette
canaille
and
burst
loudly
into
such
strange
laughter
that
petya
thought
the
french
would
see
through
the
deceit
at
once
and
he
involuntarily
stepped
back
from
the
fire
no
one
responded
to
dolokhovs
words
and
laughter
and
the
french
officer
who
could
not
be
seen
he
was
lying
wrapped
in
his
greatcoat
rose
slightly
and
whispered
something
to
his
comrade
dolokhov
got
up
and
called
the
soldier
with
the
horses
will
they
bring
the
horses
or
not
wondered
petya
involuntarily
moving
close
to
dolokhov
the
horses
were
brought
bonjour
messieurs
said
dolokhov
petya
wanted
to
say
bonsoir
but
could
not
bring
the
word
out
the
officers
were
whispering
something
among
themselves
dolokhov
took
a
long
time
mounting
his
horse
which
would
not
stand
still
then
he
rode
through
the
gates
at
a
walk
petya
rode
beside
him
wishing
and
not
daring
to
turn
around
to
see
if
the
french
were
running
after
them
or
not
coming
out
to
the
road
dolokhov
did
not
ride
back
to
the
field
but
went
through
the
village
in
one
place
he
stopped
listening
you
hear
he
said
petya
recognized
the
sounds
of
russian
voices
and
saw
the
dark
figures
of
russian
prisoners
by
the
fires
descending
to
the
bridge
petya
and
dolokhov
rode
past
the
sentry
who
gloomily
paced
the
bridge
without
saying
a
word
and
went
down
into
the
hollow
where
the
cossacks
were
waiting
well
and
now
goodbye
tell
denisov
its
set
for
dawn
at
the
first
shot
said
dolokhov
and
he
was
about
to
leave
but
petya
seized
him
by
the
sleeve
no
he
cried
youre
such
a
hero
ah
how
good
how
excellent
how
i
love
you
all
right
all
right
said
dolokhov
but
petya
would
not
let
go
of
him
and
in
the
darkness
dolokhov
made
out
that
petya
was
leaning
towards
him
he
wanted
to
kiss
dolokhov
kissed
him
laughed
and
turning
his
horse
disappeared
into
the
darkness
x
on
returning
to
the
guardhouse
petya
found
denisov
in
the
front
hall
alarmed
anxious
and
vexed
with
himself
for
having
let
petya
go
denisov
was
waiting
for
him
thank
god
he
cried
well
thank
god
he
repeated
listening
to
petyas
rapturous
story
devil
take
you
i
havent
slept
because
of
you
said
denisov
well
thank
god
now
go
to
bed
we
can
still
get
some
sleep
before
morning
yesno
said
petya
i
dont
want
to
sleep
yet
and
i
know
myself
if
i
fall
asleep
thats
the
end
and
then
i
usually
dont
sleep
before
a
battle
petya
sat
for
a
while
in
the
cottage
joyfully
recalling
the
details
of
his
ride
and
vividly
imagining
how
tomorrow
would
be
then
noticing
that
denisov
had
fallen
asleep
he
got
up
and
went
outside
outside
it
was
still
quite
dark
the
rain
had
stopped
long
ago
but
drops
were
still
falling
from
the
trees
close
to
the
guardhouse
he
could
see
the
black
outlines
of
the
cossacks
leantos
and
the
horses
tethered
together
behind
the
cottage
the
two
wagons
showed
black
with
horses
standing
by
them
and
the
dying
fire
glowed
in
the
ravine
not
all
the
cossacks
and
hussars
were
asleep
here
and
there
along
with
the
sound
of
falling
drops
and
the
closer
sound
of
horses
munching
he
could
hear
soft
as
if
whispering
voices
petya
stepped
out
of
the
front
hall
looked
around
in
the
darkness
and
went
over
to
the
wagons
someone
was
snoring
under
the
wagons
and
around
them
stood
saddled
horses
munching
oats
in
the
darkness
petya
made
out
his
horse
whom
he
called
karabakh
though
it
was
a
little
russian
horse
and
went
over
to
it
well
karabakh
tomorrow
well
do
some
service
he
said
sniffing
its
nostrils
and
kissing
it
what
master
youre
not
asleep
said
a
cossack
who
was
sitting
under
a
wagon
no
butyour
name
is
likhachev
i
believe
ive
just
come
back
we
took
a
ride
to
the
french
and
petya
told
the
cossack
in
detail
not
only
about
his
ride
but
also
why
he
had
gone
and
why
he
thought
it
was
better
to
risk
his
life
than
to
act
any
old
way
why
dont
you
get
some
sleep
said
the
cossack
no
im
used
to
it
petya
replied
maybe
the
flints
in
your
pistols
are
worn
out
i
brought
some
with
me
dont
you
need
some
take
them
the
cossack
stuck
himself
out
from
under
the
wagon
to
have
a
closer
look
at
petya
because
i
like
to
do
everything
neatly
said
petya
some
do
things
just
like
that
anyhow
without
preparing
and
then
theyre
sorry
i
dont
like
that
right
you
are
said
the
cossack
and
another
thing
please
sharpen
my
saber
dear
heart
its
gotten
bl
but
petya
was
afraid
to
lieits
never
been
sharpened
can
it
be
done
why
not
likhachev
stood
up
rummaged
in
the
packs
and
petya
soon
heard
the
martial
sound
of
steel
against
a
whetstone
he
clambered
onto
the
wagon
and
sat
on
its
edge
the
cossack
under
the
wagon
was
sharpening
the
saber
and
what
are
the
lads
asleep
asked
petya
some
are
and
some
are
like
us
well
and
what
about
the
boy
vesenny
hes
there
in
the
front
hall
just
dropped
off
fright
makes
you
sleep
he
was
so
glad
after
that
petya
was
silent
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
sounds
footsteps
came
from
the
darkness
and
a
black
figure
appeared
what
are
you
sharpening
asked
the
man
coming
up
to
the
wagon
a
saber
for
the
master
here
thats
a
good
thing
said
the
man
whom
petya
took
for
a
hussar
did
i
leave
my
bowl
here
there
by
the
wheel
the
hussar
took
the
bowl
likely
itll
be
light
soon
he
said
yawning
and
went
off
somewhere
petya
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
in
the
forest
in
denisovs
party
a
mile
from
the
road
that
he
was
sitting
on
a
wagon
captured
from
the
french
with
horses
tethered
by
it
and
that
under
him
sat
the
cossack
likhachev
sharpening
his
saber
that
the
big
black
spot
to
the
right
was
the
guardhouse
and
the
bright
red
spot
down
to
the
left
was
the
dying
campfire
that
the
man
who
had
come
for
the
bowl
was
a
hussar
who
wanted
a
drink
but
he
knew
nothing
of
that
and
did
not
want
to
know
he
was
in
a
magic
kingdom
in
which
there
was
nothing
resembling
reality
maybe
the
big
black
spot
was
indeed
the
guardhouse
but
maybe
it
was
a
cave
that
led
into
the
very
depths
of
the
earth
maybe
the
red
spot
was
a
fire
but
maybe
it
was
the
eye
of
a
huge
monster
maybe
he
is
indeed
sitting
on
a
wagon
now
but
it
very
well
may
be
that
he
is
sitting
not
on
a
wagon
but
on
a
terribly
tall
tower
from
which
if
you
fell
it
would
take
you
a
whole
day
a
whole
month
to
reach
the
earthyou
would
keep
falling
and
never
get
there
maybe
it
is
simply
the
cossack
likhachev
sitting
under
the
wagon
but
it
very
well
may
be
that
he
is
the
kindest
bravest
most
wonderful
most
excellent
man
in
the
world
whom
nobody
knows
maybe
it
was
indeed
a
hussar
who
came
for
water
and
went
back
into
the
hollow
but
maybe
he
just
vanished
from
sight
vanished
completely
and
never
was
whatever
petya
might
have
seen
now
nothing
would
have
astonished
him
he
was
in
a
magic
kingdom
in
which
everything
was
possible
he
looked
at
the
sky
the
sky
was
as
magical
as
the
earth
the
sky
was
clearing
and
clouds
raced
over
the
treetops
as
if
uncovering
the
stars
sometimes
it
seemed
that
the
clouds
dispersed
and
a
black
clear
sky
appeared
sometimes
it
seemed
that
these
black
patches
were
clouds
sometimes
it
seemed
that
the
sky
rose
high
high
above
his
head
sometimes
the
sky
came
right
down
so
that
he
could
touch
it
with
his
hand
petya
began
to
close
his
eyes
and
rock
drops
dripped
quiet
talk
went
on
horses
neighed
and
scuffled
someone
snored
ozhik
zhik
ozhik
zhik
whistled
the
saber
being
sharpened
and
suddenly
petya
heard
a
harmonious
chorus
of
music
playing
some
unknown
solemnly
sweet
hymn
petya
was
musical
like
natasha
and
more
so
than
nikolai
but
he
had
never
studied
music
or
thought
about
music
and
therefore
the
melodies
that
unexpectedly
came
to
his
head
were
especially
new
and
attractive
to
him
the
music
played
more
and
more
audibly
the
melody
grew
passing
from
one
instrument
to
another
what
is
known
as
a
fugue
was
going
on
though
petya
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
what
a
fugue
was
each
instrument
now
resembling
a
violin
now
trumpetsbut
better
and
clearer
than
violins
and
trumpetseach
instrument
played
its
own
before
finishing
its
motif
merged
with
another
starting
out
almost
the
same
and
with
a
third
and
with
a
fourth
and
they
all
merged
into
one
and
scattered
again
and
merged
again
now
solemn
and
churchly
now
brightly
brilliant
and
victorious
ah
yes
its
me
dreaming
petya
said
to
himself
rocking
forward
its
in
my
ears
and
maybe
its
my
music
well
again
go
on
my
music
now
he
closed
his
eyes
and
on
all
sides
as
if
from
far
away
sounds
trembled
began
to
harmonize
scattered
merged
and
again
all
joined
in
the
same
sweet
and
solemn
hymn
ah
how
lovely
that
is
as
much
as
i
like
and
however
i
like
petya
said
to
himself
he
attempted
to
conduct
this
huge
chorus
of
instruments
softer
softer
now
fade
away
and
the
sounds
obeyed
him
fuller
now
merrier
more
more
joyful
and
swelling
solemn
sounds
rose
from
an
unknown
depth
now
voices
join
in
petya
ordered
and
voices
first
mens
then
womens
came
from
far
away
the
voices
grew
grew
in
a
measured
solemn
effort
petya
felt
frightened
and
joyful
hearkening
to
their
uncommon
beauty
the
song
merged
with
the
solemn
victorious
march
and
drops
dripped
and
bzhik
zhik
zhikwhistled
the
saber
and
again
the
horses
scuffled
and
neighed
not
disrupting
the
chorus
but
entering
into
it
petya
did
not
know
how
long
it
went
on
he
enjoyed
it
was
surprised
all
the
while
at
his
enjoyment
and
sorry
there
was
no
one
to
share
in
it
he
was
awakened
by
likhachevs
gentle
voice
its
ready
your
honor
youll
split
a
frenchman
right
in
two
petya
woke
up
its
getting
light
already
really
getting
light
he
cried
the
formerly
invisible
horses
could
now
be
seen
down
to
their
tails
and
a
watery
light
was
coming
through
the
bared
branches
petya
shook
himself
jumped
up
took
a
rouble
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
likhachev
swung
the
saber
to
try
it
out
and
put
it
in
the
scabbard
the
cossacks
were
untying
the
horses
and
tightening
their
saddle
girths
and
heres
the
commander
said
likhachev
denisov
came
out
of
the
guardhouse
and
calling
petya
told
him
to
get
ready
xi
in
the
half
darkness
horses
were
quickly
taken
girths
were
tightened
and
units
were
formed
denisov
stood
by
the
guardhouse
giving
lastminute
orders
the
infantry
of
the
party
splashing
with
a
hundred
feet
went
ahead
on
the
road
and
quickly
disappeared
among
the
trees
in
the
predawn
mist
the
esaul
was
giving
some
orders
to
the
cossacks
petya
was
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
waiting
impatiently
for
the
order
to
mount
up
washed
with
cold
water
his
face
especially
his
eyes
burned
with
fire
a
chill
ran
down
his
spine
and
something
trembled
rapidly
and
regularly
all
over
his
body
well
is
everything
ready
asked
denisov
bring
the
horses
the
horses
were
brought
denisov
got
angry
with
the
cossack
for
the
slack
girth
and
having
rebuked
him
mounted
up
petya
took
hold
of
the
stirrup
the
horse
out
of
habit
went
to
nip
him
in
the
leg
but
petya
not
feeling
his
own
weight
quickly
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
looking
back
at
the
hussars
who
set
out
behind
him
in
the
darkness
rode
up
to
denisov
vassily
fyodorovich
will
you
entrust
me
with
something
pleasefor
gods
sake
he
said
denisov
seemed
to
have
forgotten
about
petyas
existence
he
looked
at
him
one
thing
i
ask
of
you
he
said
sternly
listen
to
me
and
dont
poke
your
nose
anywhere
during
the
whole
traverse
denisov
did
not
say
a
word
more
to
petya
and
rode
silently
when
they
rode
up
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
it
was
beginning
to
grow
noticeably
light
in
the
field
denisov
said
something
in
a
whisper
to
the
esaul
and
the
cossacks
began
to
ride
past
petya
and
denisov
when
they
had
all
ridden
past
denisov
touched
up
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
hill
sitting
back
and
sliding
the
horses
and
riders
descended
into
the
hollow
petya
rode
beside
denisov
the
trembling
in
his
whole
body
kept
increasing
it
was
growing
brighter
and
brighter
only
the
mist
hid
distant
objects
having
ridden
down
and
looked
around
denisov
nodded
to
a
cossack
who
was
standing
next
to
him
the
signal
he
said
the
cossack
raised
his
hand
a
shot
rang
out
and
at
the
same
moment
came
the
thud
of
horses
galloping
ahead
shouts
from
different
sides
and
more
shots
at
the
same
moment
as
the
sound
of
thudding
hoofs
and
shouts
rang
out
petya
lashing
his
horse
and
loosing
the
reins
not
listening
to
denisov
who
was
shouting
to
him
galloped
forward
it
seemed
to
petya
that
it
suddenly
became
completely
bright
like
midday
just
as
the
shot
rang
out
he
rode
up
to
the
bridge
ahead
of
him
cossacks
were
galloping
along
the
road
on
the
bridge
he
ran
into
a
cossack
who
lagged
behind
and
galloped
on
ahead
of
him
some
peopleit
must
have
been
the
frenchwere
running
from
the
right
side
of
the
road
to
the
left
one
fell
into
the
mud
under
the
feet
of
petyas
horse
by
one
cottage
cossacks
were
crowded
doing
something
a
terrible
cry
came
from
the
midst
of
the
crowd
petya
rode
up
to
this
crowd
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
pale
face
of
a
frenchman
with
a
trembling
lower
jaw
who
was
clutching
the
shaft
of
a
pike
pointed
at
him
hurrahladsours
cried
petya
and
giving
free
rein
to
his
excited
horse
he
rode
on
up
the
street
shooting
was
heard
ahead
cossacks
hussars
and
ragged
russian
prisoners
were
running
along
both
sides
of
the
street
shouting
something
loudly
and
incoherently
a
dashing
frenchman
in
a
blue
greatcoat
hatless
with
a
red
frowning
face
was
fighting
off
some
hussars
with
his
bayonet
when
petya
galloped
up
the
frenchman
had
already
fallen
late
again
flashed
in
petyas
head
and
he
rode
to
where
he
heard
the
sounds
of
rapid
gunfire
the
shots
were
coming
from
the
courtyard
of
the
manor
house
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
with
dolokhov
the
french
had
ensconced
themselves
there
behind
the
wattle
fence
in
a
garden
densely
overgrown
with
bushes
and
were
firing
at
the
cossacks
crowding
in
the
gateway
riding
up
to
the
gate
petya
saw
dolokhov
amidst
the
powder
smoke
with
a
pale
greenish
face
shouting
something
to
the
men
go
around
wait
for
the
infantry
he
was
shouting
just
as
petya
rode
up
to
him
waithurraaah
shouted
petya
and
not
losing
a
moment
he
galloped
towards
the
place
from
which
the
shots
were
coming
and
where
the
powder
smoke
was
thickest
a
volley
of
shots
rang
out
stray
bullets
whined
and
splatted
into
something
the
cossacks
and
dolokhov
galloped
after
petya
through
the
gates
of
the
house
in
the
dense
undulating
smoke
some
of
the
french
dropped
their
weapons
and
ran
out
of
the
bushes
towards
the
cossacks
others
ran
down
the
hill
to
the
pond
petya
galloped
on
his
horse
across
the
manor
courtyard
and
instead
of
holding
the
reins
waved
both
arms
somehow
strangely
and
quickly
and
kept
slipping
further
and
further
to
one
side
in
his
saddle
running
into
the
campfire
smoldering
in
the
morning
light
the
horse
balked
and
petya
fell
heavily
onto
the
wet
ground
the
cossacks
saw
how
his
arms
and
legs
jerked
rapidly
though
his
head
did
not
move
his
head
had
been
pierced
by
a
bullet
having
parleyed
with
the
senior
french
officer
who
came
out
to
him
from
behind
the
house
with
a
handkerchief
on
his
sword
and
announced
that
they
would
surrender
dolokhov
got
off
his
horse
and
went
over
to
petya
who
lay
motionless
with
outstretched
arms
finished
he
said
frowning
and
walked
out
of
the
gates
to
meet
denisov
who
was
riding
towards
him
killed
cried
denisov
seeing
from
far
off
the
familiar
undoubtedly
lifeless
position
in
which
petyas
body
lay
finished
dolokhov
repeated
as
if
uttering
this
word
gave
him
pleasure
and
walked
quickly
to
the
prisoners
surrounded
by
dismounted
cossacks
we
wont
take
any
he
cried
to
denisov
denisov
did
not
reply
he
rode
up
to
petya
got
off
his
horse
and
with
trembling
hands
turned
petyas
face
towards
him
it
was
stained
with
blood
and
mud
and
already
turning
pale
im
used
to
something
sweet
excellent
raisins
take
them
all
he
recalled
and
the
cossacks
glanced
around
in
surprise
at
the
sounds
similar
to
a
dogs
barking
with
which
denisov
quickly
turned
away
went
to
the
wattle
fence
and
caught
hold
of
it
among
the
russian
prisoners
retaken
by
denisov
and
dolokhov
was
pierre
bezukhov
xii
during
the
whole
time
of
its
movement
from
moscow
there
had
been
no
new
instructions
from
the
french
authorities
about
the
party
of
prisoners
that
pierre
was
in
on
the
twentysecond
of
october
that
party
was
no
longer
with
the
same
troops
and
trains
with
which
it
had
left
moscow
half
of
the
train
with
biscuits
which
had
followed
them
during
the
first
marches
had
been
taken
by
the
cossacks
the
other
half
had
gone
further
ahead
not
one
of
the
dismounted
cavalrymen
who
had
marched
before
them
was
left
they
had
all
disappeared
the
artillery
which
during
the
first
marches
could
be
seen
ahead
had
now
been
replaced
by
the
huge
train
of
marshal
junot
escorted
by
westphalians
behind
the
prisoners
came
the
train
of
cavalry
supplies
from
vyazma
the
french
troops
formerly
moving
in
three
columns
now
went
in
a
single
crowd
the
signs
of
disorder
which
pierre
had
noticed
at
the
first
halt
after
moscow
had
now
reached
the
final
degree
the
road
they
followed
was
strewn
on
both
sides
with
dead
horses
the
ragged
men
who
fell
behind
various
units
changed
constantly
now
rejoining
then
again
falling
behind
the
moving
column
several
times
during
the
march
there
were
false
alarms
and
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
raised
their
muskets
fired
and
ran
headlong
trampling
each
other
but
then
gathered
again
and
denounced
each
other
for
needless
fear
these
three
assemblies
moving
togetherthe
cavalry
depot
the
depot
of
prisoners
and
junots
trainstill
constituted
separate
entities
though
the
first
the
second
and
the
third
were
quickly
melting
away
in
the
first
depot
in
which
there
had
been
one
hundred
and
twenty
wagons
to
begin
with
there
now
remained
no
more
than
sixty
the
rest
had
been
captured
or
abandoned
of
junots
train
several
wagons
had
also
been
abandoned
or
captured
three
wagons
had
been
looted
in
a
raid
by
straggling
soldiers
from
davouts
corps
from
the
conversation
of
the
germans
pierre
heard
that
more
guards
had
been
placed
on
this
train
than
on
the
prisoners
and
that
one
of
their
comrades
a
german
soldier
had
been
shot
on
orders
from
the
marshal
himself
because
a
silver
spoon
belonging
to
the
marshal
had
been
found
among
the
soldiers
possessions
of
these
three
assemblies
the
depot
of
prisoners
had
melted
away
most
of
all
of
the
three
hundred
and
thirty
men
who
had
set
out
from
moscow
there
now
remained
less
than
a
hundred
the
prisoners
were
a
still
greater
burden
to
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
than
the
saddles
of
the
cavalry
depot
or
junots
train
they
understood
that
the
saddles
and
junots
spoons
might
be
of
some
use
but
why
the
hungry
and
cold
soldiers
had
to
stand
guard
and
watch
over
equally
cold
and
hungry
russians
who
were
dying
and
fell
behind
on
the
road
who
were
ordered
to
be
shotthis
was
not
only
incomprehensible
but
also
repugnant
and
the
convoy
as
if
fearing
in
the
grievous
position
they
found
themselves
to
give
way
to
the
pity
they
felt
for
the
prisoners
and
thereby
worsen
their
own
position
treated
them
especially
grimly
and
sternly
in
dorogobuzh
while
the
convoy
soldiers
having
locked
the
prisoners
in
a
stable
had
gone
to
loot
their
own
storehouses
several
of
the
imprisoned
soldiers
tunneled
under
the
wall
and
escaped
but
they
were
caught
by
the
french
and
shot
the
former
order
introduced
at
the
departure
from
moscow
that
the
captive
officers
would
go
separately
from
the
soldiers
had
long
since
been
abolished
all
those
who
could
walk
went
together
and
since
the
third
march
pierre
had
been
reunited
with
karataev
and
the
bowlegged
purplish
dog
who
had
chosen
karataev
for
its
master
karataev
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
moscow
came
down
with
that
fever
in
which
he
had
been
lying
in
the
moscow
hospital
and
as
he
grew
weaker
pierre
withdrew
from
him
pierre
did
not
know
why
but
ever
since
karataev
had
begun
to
weaken
he
had
had
to
make
an
effort
to
approach
him
and
approaching
him
and
listening
to
the
quiet
moaning
with
which
karataev
usually
lay
down
during
their
halts
and
sensing
the
increased
smell
that
karataev
now
gave
off
pierre
moved
further
away
from
him
and
did
not
think
about
him
in
captivity
in
the
shed
pierre
had
learned
not
with
his
mind
but
with
his
whole
being
his
life
that
man
is
created
for
happiness
that
happiness
is
within
him
in
the
satisfying
of
natural
human
needs
and
that
all
unhappiness
comes
not
from
lack
but
from
superfluity
but
now
in
these
last
three
weeks
of
the
march
he
had
learned
a
new
and
more
comforting
truthhe
had
learned
that
there
is
nothing
frightening
in
the
world
he
had
learned
that
as
there
is
no
situation
in
the
world
in
which
a
man
can
be
happy
and
perfectly
free
so
there
is
no
situation
in
which
he
can
be
perfectly
unhappy
and
unfree
he
had
learned
that
there
is
a
limit
to
suffering
and
a
limit
to
freedom
and
that
those
limits
are
very
close
that
the
man
who
suffers
because
one
leaf
is
askew
in
his
bed
of
roses
suffers
as
much
as
he
now
suffered
falling
asleep
on
the
bare
damp
ground
one
side
getting
cold
as
the
other
warmed
up
that
when
he
used
to
put
on
his
tight
ballroom
shoes
he
suffered
just
as
much
as
now
when
he
walked
quite
barefoot
his
shoes
had
long
since
worn
out
and
his
feet
were
covered
with
sores
he
learned
that
when
by
his
own
will
as
it
had
seemed
to
him
he
had
married
his
wife
he
had
been
no
more
free
than
now
when
he
was
locked
in
a
stable
for
the
night
of
all
that
he
too
later
called
suffering
but
which
at
the
time
he
hardly
felt
the
main
thing
was
his
bare
feet
covered
with
sores
and
scabs
horsemeat
was
tasty
and
nutritious
the
saltpeter
bouquet
of
the
gunpowder
they
used
instead
of
salt
was
even
agreeable
there
were
no
great
cold
spells
and
walking
in
the
daytime
always
made
him
hot
while
at
night
there
were
campfires
the
lice
that
ate
him
warmed
his
body
pleasantly
one
thing
was
painful
at
firsthis
feet
on
the
second
day
of
the
march
when
pierre
examined
his
sores
by
the
campfire
he
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
step
on
them
but
when
everybody
got
up
he
went
along
limping
and
then
having
warmed
up
walked
without
pain
though
by
evening
his
feet
were
still
more
frightful
to
look
at
but
he
did
not
look
at
them
and
thought
of
other
things
only
now
did
pierre
understand
the
full
force
of
human
vitality
and
the
saving
power
of
the
shifting
of
attention
that
has
been
put
in
man
similar
to
the
safety
valve
in
steam
engines
which
releases
the
extra
steam
as
soon
as
the
pressure
exceeds
a
certain
norm
he
did
not
see
or
hear
how
the
prisoners
who
fell
behind
were
shot
though
more
than
a
hundred
of
them
had
already
died
in
that
way
he
did
not
think
about
karataev
who
grew
weaker
every
day
and
obviously
would
soon
be
subjected
to
the
same
lot
still
less
did
pierre
think
about
himself
the
harder
his
situation
became
the
more
terrible
the
future
the
more
independent
of
the
situation
he
found
himself
in
were
the
joyful
and
calming
thoughts
memories
and
images
that
came
to
him
xiii
at
noon
on
the
twentysecond
pierre
was
going
up
a
hill
on
a
muddy
slippery
road
looking
at
his
feet
and
the
unevenness
of
the
way
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
the
familiar
crowd
around
him
then
again
at
his
feet
both
were
equally
his
own
and
familiar
to
him
the
bowlegged
purplish
gray
ran
merrily
along
the
side
of
the
road
cocking
its
hind
leg
and
hopping
on
three
to
prove
its
agility
and
satisfaction
then
dashing
along
again
on
all
four
barking
at
the
crows
that
sat
on
the
carrion
gray
was
sleeker
and
merrier
than
in
moscow
on
all
sides
lay
the
flesh
of
various
animals
from
men
to
horses
in
various
stages
of
decay
the
walking
men
kept
the
wolves
from
coming
near
so
that
gray
could
eat
as
much
as
he
liked
it
had
been
raining
all
morning
and
had
seemed
as
if
it
were
just
about
to
stop
and
the
sky
to
clear
when
after
a
short
pause
the
rain
would
come
down
harder
still
the
rainsoaked
road
no
longer
absorbed
water
and
streams
flowed
down
the
ruts
pierre
walked
along
looking
on
all
sides
counting
his
steps
by
threes
and
bending
his
fingers
addressing
the
rain
he
was
inwardly
saying
to
it
well
well
go
on
give
us
some
more
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
but
somewhere
far
and
deep
his
soul
was
thinking
something
important
and
comforting
that
something
was
the
subtlest
spiritual
extract
from
his
conversation
the
day
before
with
karataev
the
day
before
at
their
nightly
halt
having
grown
cold
by
a
dead
campfire
pierre
had
gotten
up
and
gone
over
to
the
nearest
betterburning
fire
by
the
fire
he
went
to
sat
platon
his
greatcoat
covering
his
head
like
a
priests
vestment
telling
the
soldiers
in
his
quick
pleasant
but
weak
sickly
voice
a
story
pierre
knew
it
was
already
past
midnight
this
was
the
time
when
karataev
usually
recovered
from
his
bouts
of
fever
and
was
especially
animated
coming
up
to
the
fire
and
hearing
platons
weak
sickly
voice
and
seeing
his
pitiful
face
brightly
lit
by
the
fire
pierre
felt
something
stab
his
heart
unpleasantly
he
was
afraid
of
his
pity
for
this
man
and
wanted
to
go
away
but
there
was
no
other
fire
and
so
trying
not
to
look
at
platon
pierre
sat
down
by
the
fire
so
hows
your
health
he
asked
my
health
lament
for
your
sickness
and
god
wont
grant
you
death
said
karataev
and
he
went
back
at
once
to
the
story
he
had
begun
and
so
brother
mine
platon
continued
with
a
smile
on
his
thin
pale
face
and
with
a
special
joyful
brightness
in
his
eyes
so
brother
mine
pierre
had
long
known
this
story
karataev
had
told
it
to
him
alone
some
six
times
and
always
with
a
special
joyful
feeling
but
however
well
pierre
knew
this
story
he
now
listened
to
it
as
something
new
and
the
quiet
rapture
that
karataev
clearly
felt
as
he
told
it
communicated
itself
to
pierre
it
was
a
story
about
an
old
merchant
who
lived
a
seemly
and
godfearing
life
with
his
family
and
went
once
with
a
comrade
a
rich
merchant
to
the
makary
having
stopped
at
an
inn
the
two
merchants
went
to
bed
and
the
next
day
the
comrade
was
found
murdered
and
robbed
the
bloody
knife
was
found
under
the
old
merchants
pillow
the
merchant
was
tried
punished
with
the
knout
and
having
had
his
nostrils
slit
wasin
due
order
as
karataev
saidsent
to
hard
labor
and
so
brother
mine
pierre
arrived
at
this
point
in
karataevs
story
ten
years
or
more
go
by
after
this
affair
the
old
man
lives
at
hard
labor
duly
submits
does
nothing
bad
only
asks
god
for
death
good
and
the
convicts
got
together
a
nightly
thing
like
you
and
me
here
and
the
old
man
was
with
them
they
started
talking
about
who
suffers
for
what
and
what
hes
guilty
of
before
god
they
began
telling
this
one
killed
a
man
that
one
killed
two
another
set
a
fire
another
was
a
runaway
so
he
did
nothing
they
started
asking
the
old
man
what
are
you
suffering
for
grandpa
i
my
dear
brothers
he
says
am
suffering
for
my
own
and
other
peoples
sins
i
didnt
kill
anybody
or
take
anything
that
wasnt
mine
but
even
gave
to
beggars
i
my
dear
brothers
was
a
merchant
i
had
great
wealth
thus
and
so
he
says
that
is
he
told
them
how
the
whole
thing
went
in
proper
order
i
dont
grieve
over
myself
he
says
god
that
is
has
found
me
i
only
pity
my
old
woman
and
children
and
so
the
old
man
wept
in
their
company
there
happened
to
be
the
very
man
who
had
killed
the
merchant
where
did
it
happen
grandpa
he
says
when
in
what
monthhe
asked
everything
his
heart
ached
inside
him
he
goes
up
to
the
old
man
andplop
at
his
feet
youre
perishing
because
of
me
old
man
its
the
real
truth
this
man
is
suffering
lads
he
says
guiltlessly
and
needlessly
i
did
that
deed
he
says
and
put
the
knife
under
your
head
while
you
slept
forgive
me
grandpa
he
says
for
christs
sake
karataev
fell
silent
smiling
joyfully
gazing
at
the
fire
and
he
adjusted
the
logs
and
the
old
man
says
god
will
forgive
you
and
were
all
sinful
before
god
im
suffering
for
my
own
sins
and
he
wept
bitter
tears
and
what
do
you
think
little
falcon
karataev
was
speaking
with
a
rapturous
smile
that
beamed
brighter
and
brighter
as
if
what
he
was
about
to
tell
contained
the
chief
delight
and
the
whole
meaning
of
the
story
what
do
you
think
little
falcon
this
same
murderer
denounced
himself
to
the
authorities
i
killed
six
men
he
says
he
was
a
great
villain
but
im
sorriest
for
this
old
man
let
him
not
lament
on
account
of
me
he
declared
it
they
wrote
it
down
duly
sent
a
letter
this
was
a
faroff
place
it
was
a
while
before
everything
got
done
all
the
papers
filled
out
as
they
ought
to
the
authorities
that
is
it
went
all
the
way
to
the
tsar
time
passed
the
tsars
ukase
came
release
the
merchant
give
him
a
reward
as
much
as
they
decided
the
paper
came
they
started
searching
for
the
old
man
wheres
that
old
man
who
has
suffered
guiltlessly
and
needlessly
a
paper
has
come
from
the
tsar
they
started
searching
karataevs
lower
jaw
quivered
but
god
had
already
forgiven
himhe
was
dead
there
it
is
little
falcon
karataev
concluded
and
for
a
long
time
smiling
silently
he
looked
straight

a
voice
suddenly
cried
among
the
prisoners
and
the
convoy
a
joyful
commotion
and
expectation
of
something
happy
and
solemn
set
in
shouts
of
command
were
heard
on
all
sides
and
cavalrymen
appeared
to
the
left
welldressed
on
good
horses
trotting
around
the
prisoners
on
all
faces
there
was
the
expression
of
tension
that
people
have
at
the
proximity
of
high
powers
the
prisoners
pressed
together
they
were
pushed
off

the

had
no

passed
than
a
carriage
rumbled
by
drawn
by
gray
horses
in
tandem
pierre
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
calm
handsome
fat
and
white
face
of
a
man
in
a
threecornered
hat
it
was
one
of
the
marshals
the
marshals
gaze
turned
to
the
large
conspicuous
figure
of
pierre
and
in
the
expression
with
which
this
marshal
frowned
and
turned
away
pierre
fancied
he
saw
compassion
and
the
desire
to
conceal
it
the
general
who
led
the
depot
his
face
red
and
frightened
urging
on
his
skinny
horse
galloped
after
the

several
officers
came
together
with

pierre
heard
as
the
marshal
was
driving
by
the
prisoners
pressed
together
and
pierre
saw
karataev
whom
he
had
not
yet
seen
that
morning
karataev
in
his
meager
greatcoat
sat
leaning
against
a
birch
tree
in
his
face
besides
the
expression
of
yesterdays
joyful
tenderness
as
he
was
telling
the
story
of
the
merchants
guiltless
suffering
there
also
shone
an
expression
of
quiet
solemnity
karataev
looked
at
pierre
with
his
kind
round
eyes
now
veiled
with
tears
and
was
evidently
calling
him
over
wanting
to
say
something
but
pierre
was
too
afraid
for
himself
he
pretended
that
he
had
not
seen
his
look
and
hurriedly
walked
away
when
the
prisoners
started
off
again
pierre
looked
back
karataev
was
sitting
at
the
edge
of
the
road
by
the
birch
and
two
frenchmen
were
saying
something
over
him
pierre
did
not
look
any
longer
he
went
limping
up
the
hill
from
behind
where
karataev
had
been
sitting
came
the
sound
of
a
shot
pierre
heard
the
shot
clearly
but
the
moment
he
heard
it
he
recalled
that
he
had
not
finished
the
calculation
begun
before
the
marshal
passed
of
how
many
marches
there
remained
to
smolensk
and
he
started
to
count
two
french
soldiers
one
of
them
holding
a
smoking
gun
in
his
hand
ran
past
pierre
both
were
pale
and
the
expression
of
their
facesone
of
them
glanced
timidly
at
pierrehad
something
in
it
similar
to
what
he
had
seen
in
the
young
soldier
at
the
execution
pierre
looked
at
the
soldier
and
remembered
how
two
days
before
this
soldier
had
burned
his
shirt
while
drying
it
over
the
campfire
and
how
everybody
had
laughed
at
him
a
dog
began
to
howl
behind
in
the
place
where
karataev
had
been
sitting
what
a
fool
whats
it
howling
about
thought
pierre
like
him
his
soldier
comrades
walking
beside
pierre
did
not
turn
to
look
at
the
place
from
which
the
shot
had
been
heard
and
then
the
howling
of
the
dog
but
there
was
a
stern
look
on
all
their
faces
xv
the
depot
and
the
prisoners
and
the
marshals
train
stopped
in
the
village
of
shamshevo
they
all
crowded
in
a
mass
by
the
campfires
pierre
went
up
to
the
fire
ate
some
roasted
horsemeat
lay
down
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
fell
asleep
at
once
he
slept
again
the
same
sleep
as
he
had
slept
in
mozhaisk
after
the
battle
of
borodino
again
the
events
of
reality
combined
with
dreams
and
again
someone
he
himself
or
some
other
person
spoke
thoughts
to
him
and
even
the
same
thoughts
that
had
been
spoken
to
him
in
mozhaisk
life
is
everything
life
is
god
everything
shifts
and
moves
and
this
movement
is
god
and
while
there
is
life
there
is
delight
in
the
selfawareness
of
the
divinity
to
love
life
is
to
love
god
the
hardest
and
most
blissful
thing
is
to
love
this
life
in
ones
suffering
in
the
guiltlessness
of
suffering
karataev
pierre
recalled
and
suddenly
a
longforgotten
meek
old
teacher
who
had
taught
him
geography
in
switzerland
emerged
in
pierres
mind
as
if
alive
wait
said
the
old
man
and
he
showed
pierre
a
globe
this
globe
was
a
living
wavering
ball
of
no
dimensions
the
entire
surface
of
the
ball
consisted
of
drops
tightly
packed
together
and
these
drops
all
moved
and
shifted
and
now
merged
from
several
into
one
now
divided
from
one
into
many
each
drop
strove
to
spread
and
take
up
the
most
space
but
the
others
striving
to
do
the
same
pressed
it
sometimes
destroying
sometimes
merging
with
it
this
is
life
said
the
old
teacher
how
simple
and
clear
it
is
thought
pierre
how
could
i
not
have
known
before
in
the
center
is
god
and
each
drop
strives
to
expand
in
order
to
reflect
him
in
the
greatest
measure
it
grows
merges
and
shrinks
and
is
obliterated
on
the
surface
goes
into
the
depths
and
again
floats
up
here
he
is
karataev
see
he
spread
and
vanished

the

shouted
the
voice
and
pierre
woke
up
he
raised
himself
and
sat
up
a
frenchman
was
squatting
by
the
fire
having
just
shoved
a
russian
soldier
aside
and
was
roasting
some
meat
on
a
ramrod
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
his
sinewy
hairy
stubfingered
red
hands
were
deftly
turning
the
ramrod
his
brown
gloomy
face
with
frowning
eyebrows
was
clearly
visible
in
the
light
from
the
coals

growled
glancing
quickly
at

behind
him

and
turning
the

he
glanced
gloomily
at

pierre
turned
away
peering
into
the
shadows
one
captive
russian
soldier
the
one
whom
the
frenchman
had
shoved
aside
was
sitting
by
the
fire
and
patting
something
with
his
hand
looking
more
closely
pierre
recognized
the
purplish
dog
who
was
sitting
by
the
soldier
wagging
its
tail
ah
its
come
said
pierre
ah

he
began
and
did
not
finish
in
his
imagination
suddenly
simultaneously
connecting
among
themselves
memories
emerged
of
the
gaze
with
which
platon
had
looked
at
him
sitting
under
the
tree
of
the
shot
he
had
heard
from
that
spot
of
the
howling
of
a
dog
of
the
criminal
faces
of
the
two
frenchmen
who
had
run
past
him
of
the
smoking
gun
in
the
hand
of
the
absence
of
karataev
at
this
halt
and
he
was
ready
then
to
understand
that
karataev
had
been
killed
but
at
the
same
moment
a
memory
emerged
in
his
soul
coming
from
god
knows
where
of
an
evening
he
had
spent
with
a
beautiful
polish
woman
in
the
summer
on
the
balcony
of
his
house
in
kiev
and
still
not
connecting
the
memories
of
that
day
and
not
drawing
any
conclusions
about
them
pierre
closed
his
eyes
and
the
picture
of
summer
nature
mixed
with
the
memory
of
bathing
of
the
liquid
wavering
ball
and
he
sank
somewhere
into
the
water
so
that
the
water
closed
over
his
head
before
sunrise
he
was
awakened
by
loud
rapid
gunshots
and
shouting
french
soldiers
ran
past
him
les
cosaques
one
of
them
shouted
and
a
moment
later
pierre
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
russian
faces
for
a
long
time
pierre
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
him
on
all
sides
he
heard
his
comrades
shouts
of
joy

the

pierre
sobbed
sitting
among
them
and
could
not
utter
a
word
he
embraced
the
first
soldier
who
came
up
to
him
and
kissed
him

shaken
by
all
that
had

talked
loudly
among
themselves
but
as
they
went
past
dolokhov
who
tapped
himself
lightly
on
the
boots
with
a
whip
and
looked
at
them
with
his
cold
glassy
gaze
which
promised
nothing

the

kept

flashed
with
a
cruel

from
the
twentyeighth
of

when
the
frosts
set
in
the
flight
of
the
french
only
acquired
a
more
tragic
character
of
men
freezing
or
roasting
to
death
by
campfires
and
of
the
emperor
kings
and
dukes
in
fur
coats
continuing
to
drive
on
in
carriages
filled
with
stolen
goods
but
in
essence
the
process
of
the
flight
and
decomposition
of
the
french
army
had
not
changed
in
the
least
since
the
departure
from
moscow
between
moscow
and
vyazma
of
the
french
army
of
seventythree
thousand
men
not
counting
the
guards
who
did
nothing
but
loot
during
the
entire
war
there
remained
thirtysix
thousand
though
no
more
than
five
thousand
had
been
lost
in

this
is
the
first
member
of
a
progression
which
determines
the
subsequent
members
with
mathematical
certainty
the
french

away

into
smolensk
which
in
their
imagination
was
a
promised
land
the
french
killed
each
other
over
provisions
looted
their
own

and
when
everything
had
been

ran
further
they
all
went
not

themselves
where
they
were

why
the
genius
napoleon

still

the

nothing

to
them
because
nothing
could
be

and
despite
their
calling
themselves
majesties

they
all
felt
that
they
were
pathetic
and
vile
people
who
had
done
a
great
deal
of
evil
for
which
they
now
had
to
pay
and
despite
their
pretence
of
looking

each

the
actions

on

then
on

when
something
could
have
been
done
the
army
had
already
gone
two
marches
further
and
was
in
a
completely
different
position
one
army
ran
the
other
pursued
from
smolensk
the
french
had
many
different
roads
before
them
and
it
would
seem
that
staying
for
four
days
the
french
could
have
found
out
where
the
enemy
was
worked
out
something
advantageous
and
undertaken
something
new
but
after
the
fourday
halt
their
crowds
again
ran
not
to
the
right
not
to
the
left
but
without
any
maneuvers
or
considerations
down
the
old
worst
road
to
krasnoe
and

the
beaten
track
expecting
the
enemy
from
behind
and
not
from
in
front
the
french
ran
stringing
out
and
separating
from
each
other
over
a
twentyfourhour
stretch
ahead
of
them
all
ran
the
emperor
then
the
kings
then
the
dukes
the
russian
army
thinking
that
napoleon
would
bear
to
the
right
beyond
the
dnieper
which
was
the
only
reasonable
thing
also
bore
to
the
right
and
came
out
on
the
main
road
to
krasnoe
and
here
as
in
the
game
of
blindmans
buff
the
french
ran
into
our
vanguard
unexpectedly
sighting
the
foe
the
french
became
confused
stopped
from
the
unexpectedness
of
the
fright
but
then
ran
on
again
abandoning
their
comrades
who
followed
behind
here
for
three
days
separate
units
of
the
french
first
the
viceroys
then
davouts
then
neys
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
russian
troops
they
all
abandoned
each
other
abandoned
their
loads
artillery
half
their
men
and
ran
getting
around
the
russians
only
by
night
making
semicircles
to
the
right
ney
coming
last
because
he
had
busied
himself
with
blowing
up
the
walls
of
smolensk
which
were
not
hindering
anyone
in
spite
of
their
unfortunate
position
or
precisely
because
of
it
they
wanted
to
give
a
beating
to
the
floor
on
which
they
had
hurt
themselvescoming
last
ney
who
had
a
corps
of
ten
thousand
came
running
to
napoleon
in
orsha
with
only
a
thousand
men
having
abandoned
all
the
other
men
and
all
his
cannon
and
stolen
away
in
the
night
making
his
way
through
a
forest
and
across
the
dnieper
from
orsha
they
ran
further
along
the
road
to
vilno
playing
blindmans
buff
with
the
enemy
in
the
same
way
at
the
berezina
they
again
fell
into
confusion
many
were
drowned
many
surrendered
but
those
who
got
across
the
river
ran
further
their
supreme
leader
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
getting
into
a
sledge
galloped
off
alone
abandoning
his
comrades
whoever
could
also
rode
off
whoever
could
not
surrendered
or
died
xviii
it
would
seem
in
this
campaign
of
the
flight
of
the
french
when
they
did
everything
they
could
to
destroy
themselves
when
not
a
single
movement
of
this
crowd
from
the
turn
onto
the
kaluga
road
to
the
flight
of
the
leader
from
his
army
made
the
least
senseit
would
seem
finally
impossible
in
this
period
of
the
campaign
for
historians
who
ascribe
the
actions
of
the
masses
to
the
will
of
one
man
to
describe
this
retreat
in
their
sense
but
no
mountains
of
books
have
been
written
by
historians
about
this
campaign
and
they
all
describe
napoleons
orders
and
his
profound
plansthe
maneuvers
that
guided
the
troops
and
the
brilliant
orders
of
his
marshals
the
retreat
from
maloyaroslavets
when
the
road
to
abundant
lands
was
given
to
him
and
when
the
parallel
road
on
which
kutuzov
later
pursued
him
was
also
open
the
unnecessary
retreat
along
a
devastated
road
is
explained
to
us
by
various
profound
considerations
his
retreat
from
smolensk
to
orsha
is
described
by
means
of
the
same
profound
considerations
then
his
heroism
at
krasnoe
is
described
where
he
is
supposed
to
have
been
preparing
to
accept
battle
and
command
it
himself
and
walked
about
with
a
birch
stick
saying
jai
assez
fait
lempereur
il
est
temps
de
faire
le
g233n233ral
and
despite
that
immediately
afterwards
ran
further
abandoning
to
their
fate
the
scattered
units
of
the
army
he
left
behind
then
the
greatness
of
soul
of
the
marshals
is
described
for
us
especially
of
ney
his
greatness
of
soul
consisting
in
his
making
a
roundabout
way
by
night
through
the
forest
and
across
the
dnieper
coming
on
the
run
to
orsha
minus
banners
and
artillery
and
nine
tenths
of
his
troops
and
lastly
the
final
departure
of
the
great
emperor
from
his
heroic
army
is
presented
to
us
by
historians
as
something
great
and
marked
by
genius
even
this
final
act
of
flight
known
in
human
language
as
the
final
degree
of
baseness
which
every
child
is
taught
to
be
ashamed
of
even
this
act
receives
justification
in
the
language
of
the
historians
then
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
stretch
the
soelastic
threads
of
historical
discourse
any
further
when
an
action
clearly
contradicts
all
that
mankind
calls
good
and
even
just
historians
resort
to
the
saving
notion
of
greatness
it
is
as
if
greatness
excludes
the
possibility
of
the
measure
of
good
and
bad
for
the
great
man
there
is
no
bad
there
is
no
horror
that
can
be
laid
to
the
blame
of
someone
who
is
great
cest
grand
say
the
historians
and
then
there
is
no
longer
any
good
or
bad
but
there
is
grand
and
not
grand
grand
is
good
not
grand
is
bad
grand
to
their
minds
is
the
property
of
some
sort
of
special
animals
known
as
heroes
and
napoleon
in
his
warm
fur
coat
clearing
off
for
home
from
his
perishing
men
who
are
not
only
comrades
but
in
his
opinion
people
he
has
brought
there
feels
que
cest
grand
and
his
soul
is
at
peace
du
sublime
he
sees
something
sublime
in
himself
au
ridicule
il
ny
a
quun
pas
he
says
and
for
fifty
years
the
whole
world
repeats
sublime
grand
napol233on
le
grand
du
sublime
au
ridicule
il
ny
a
quun
pas
and
it
never
enters
anyones
head
that
the
recognition
of
a
greatness
not
measurable
by
the
measure
of
good
and
bad
is
only
a
recognition
of
ones
own
insignificance
and
immeasurable
littleness
for
us
with
the
measures
of
good
and
bad
given
us
by
christ
nothing
is
immeasurable
and
there
is
no
greatness
where
there
is
no
simplicity
goodness
and
truth
xix
who
among
russian
people
reading
the
descriptions
of
the
last
period
of
the
campaign
of
1812
has
not
experienced
an
oppressive
feeling
of
vexation
dissatisfaction
and
vagueness
who
has
not
asked
himself
the
questions
why
were
all
the
french
not
captured
not
destroyed
when
three
armies
surrounded
them
in
superior
numbers
when
the
disordered
french
starving
and
freezing
surrendered
in
masses
and
when
as
the
historians
tell
us
the
aim
of
the
russians
consisted
precisely
in
stopping
cutting
off
and
capturing
all
the
french
how
did
it
happen
that
the
russian
army
which
weaker
in
numbers
than
the
french
gave
battle
at
borodino
how
did
it
happen
that
this
army
surrounding
the
french
on
three
sides
and
having
the
aim
of
capturing
them
failed
to
do
so
can
it
be
that
the
french
had
such
an
enormous
advantage
over
us
that
we
surrounding
them
with
superior
forces
could
not
beat
them
how
could
that
happen
history
or
what
is
called
by
that
name
in
answering
these
questions
says
that
this
happened
because
kutuzov
and
tormasov
and
chichagov
and
soandso
and
soandso
did
not
execute
suchandsuch
maneuvers
but
why
did
they
not
execute
all
these
maneuvers
why
if
they
were
to
blame
for
not
achieving
the
intended
aimwhy
were
they
not
tried
and
executed
but
even
if
we
allow
that
kutuzov
and
chichagov
and
so
on
were
to
blame
for
the
failure
of
the
russians
it
is
impossible
to
understand
why
in
such
conditions
as
the
russians
were
in
at
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
in
both
cases
the
russians
had
superior
forces
why
was
the
french
army
with
its
marshals
kings
and
emperors
not
taken
captive
if
that
was
the
aim
of
the
russians
the
explanation
of
this
strange
phenomenon
as
russian
military
historians
give
itthat
kutuzov
prevented
the
attackis
groundless
because
we
know
that
kutuzovs
will
could
not
keep
the
troops
from
attacking
at
vyazma
and
tarutino
why
was
the
same
russian
army
which
with
weaker
forces
could
gain
the
victory
at
borodino
over
an
enemy
in
full
force
defeated
at
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
where
its
forces
were
superior
by
the
disorderly
crowds
of
the
french
if
the
aim
of
the
russians
consisted
in
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
the
marshals
and
that
aim
was
not
only
not
achieved
but
all
the
attempts
to
achieve
it
were
thwarted
each
time
in
the
most
shameful
way
then
the
last
period
of
the
campaign
is
quite
correctly
presented
by
the
french
as
a
series
of
victories
and
is
quite
incorrectly
presented
by
russian
military
historians
as
victorious
russian
military
historians
insofar
as
they
are
bound
by
logic
involuntarily
come
to
this
conclusion
and
despite
lyrical
proclamations
of
courage
and
devotion
and
so
on
have
had
involuntarily
to
admit
that
the
retreat
of
the
french
from
moscow
was
a
series
of
victories
for
napoleon
and
of
defeats
for
kutuzov
but
leaving
national
vanity
completely
aside
one
feels
that
this
conclusion
contains
an
inner
contradiction
because
the
series
of
french
victories
brought
them
to
total
destruction
while
the
series
of
russian
defeats
led
them
to
the
total
destruction
of
the
foe
and
the
purging
of
the
fatherland
the
source
of
this
contradiction
lies
in
the
fact
that
historians
who
study
the
events
from
the
letters
of
sovereigns
and
generals
from
relations
reports
plans
and
so
on
posit
a
false
neverexisting
aim
for
the
last
period
of
the
war
of
1812an
aim
which
supposedly
consisted
in
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
with
his
marshals
and
his
army
this
aim
never
existed
and
could
not
exist
because
it
made
no
sense
and
to
achieve
it
was
totally
impossible
this
aim
made
no
sense
first
because
napoleons
disordered
army
was
fleeing
russia
with
all
possible
speed
that
is
carrying
out
the
very
thing
that
any
russian
could
desire
what
then
was
the
need
of
performing
various
operations
on
the
french
who
were
simply
fleeing
as
fast
as
they
could
second
it
was
senseless
to
stand
in
the
way
of
people
who
had
put
all
their
energy
into
flight
third
it
was
senseless
to
waste
our
troops
on
the
destruction
of
the
french
army
which
was
being
annihilated
without
any
external
causes
in
such
a
progression
that
without
any
blocking
of
the
path
they
were
unable
to
bring
across
the
border
more
than
what
they
brought
across
in
the
month
of
december
that
is
one
hundredth
of
the
entire
army
fourth
it
was
senseless
to
wish
to
take
prisoner
the
emperor
the
kings
the
dukespeople
whose
capture
would
have
hampered
the
actions
of
the
russians
in
the
highest
degree
as
was
recognized
by
the
most
skillful
diplomats
of
that
time
joseph
de
maistre
and
others
still
more
senseless
would
have
been
the
wish
to
capture
whole
corps
of
the
french
when
our
own
troops
had
melted
away
by
half
before
reaching
krasnoe
and
for
corps
of
prisoners
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
detach
divisions
as
a
convoy
and
when
our
own
soldiers
did
not
always
receive
full
rations
and
the
prisoners
already
taken
were
starving
to
death
the
whole
profound
plan
of
cutting
off
and
capturing
napoleon
and
his
army
was
like
the
plan
of
a
farmer
who
while
driving
out
the
cattle
who
were
trampling
his
vegetable
garden
would
run
to
the
gate
and
start
beating
those
cattle
on
the
head
the
one
thing
that
might
be
said
to
justify
the
farmer
is
that
he
was
very
angry
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
even
that
about
the
devisers
of
this
project
because
it
was
not
they
who
suffered
from
the
trampled
vegetable
patch
but
besides
the
fact
that
the
cutting
off
of
napoleon
and
his
army
was
senseless
it
was
also
impossible
it
was
impossible
first
because
as
is
clear
from
experience
in
battle
the
movement
of
columns
over
a
stretch
of
three
miles
never
conforms
to
plans
so
that
the
probability
of
chichagov
kutuzov
and
wittgenstein
coming
together
on
time
in
the
appointed
place
would
have
been
so
slight
that
it
was
next
to
impossible
as
kutuzov
thought
who
on
receiving
the
plan
said
that
diversions
over
long
distances
do
not
bring
the
desired
results
second
it
was
impossible
because
in
order
to
paralyze
that
force
of
inertia
with
which
napoleons
troops
were
moving
back
an
incomparably
bigger
army
was
needed
than
that
which
the
russians
had
third
it
was
impossible
because
the
military
term
to
cut
off
has
no
meaning
one
can
cut
off
a
piece
of
bread
but
not
an
army
to
cut
off
an
armyto
bar
its
wayis
quite
impossible
because
there
is
always
plenty
of
room
for
it
to
go
around
and
there
is
the
night
during
which
nothing
can
be
seen
of
which
military
historians
could
satisfy
themselves
if
only
from
the
examples
of
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
to
take
a
prisoner
is
quite
impossible
unless
the
one
being
taken
prisoner
agrees
to
it
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
catch
a
swallow
though
you
can
catch
one
if
it
settles
on
your
hand
it
is
possible
to
take
prisoner
someone
who
surrenders
like
the
germans
according
to
the
rules
of
strategy
and
tactics
but
the
french
troops
quite
rightly
did
not
find
that
suitable
since
death
from
hunger
and
cold
awaited
them
equally
in
flight
and
in
captivity
fourth
and
chiefly
it
was
impossible
because
never
as
long
as
the
world
has
existed
has
there
been
a
war
under
such
terrible
conditions
as
those
in
which
the
war
of
1812
took
place
and
the
russian
troops
strained
all
their
forces
in
their
pursuit
of
the
french
and
could
not
do
more
without
destroying
themselves
in
its
movement
from
tarutino
to
krasnoe
the
russian
army
lost
fifty
thousand
men
sick
or
fallen
behind
which
is
a
number
equal
to
the
population
of
a
large
provincial
town
half
the
men
dropped
out
of
the
army
without
any
battles
and
of
this
period
of
the
campaign
when
troops
without
boots
and
warm
coats
without
sufficient
rations
without
vodka
for
months
spending
nights
in
the
snow
at
fifteen
degrees
of
frost
when
the
day
is
only
seven
or
eight
hours
long
and
the
rest
is
night
during
which
discipline
can
have
no
influence
when
not
as
in
a
battle
in
which
men
enter
the
realm
of
death
where
there
is
no
longer
any
discipline
for
only
a
few
hours
but
when
men
live
for
months
fighting
every
moment
with
death
from
hunger
and
cold
when
half
the
army
perishes
within
a
monthof
this
period
of
the
campaign
we
are
told
by
historians
how
miloradovich
was
to
have
made
a
flanking
movement
here
and
tormasov
there
and
how
chichagov
was
to
have
moved
over
there
to
move
kneedeep
in
snow
and
how
soandso
overran
and
cut
off
and
so
on
and
so
forth
the
russians
dying
by
half
did
all
they
could
do
and
should
have
done
to
achieve
an
aim
worthy
of
the
nation
and
are
not
to
blame
if
other
russian
people
sitting
in
warm
rooms
proposed
doing
what
was
impossible
this
whole
strange
now
incomprehensible
contradiction
between
facts
and
historical
descriptions
comes
only
from
the
fact
that
the
historians
who
wrote
about
this
event
wrote
the
history
of
the
beautiful
feelings
and
words
of
various
generals
and
not
the
history
of
the
events
themselves
they
find
very
interesting
the
words
of
miloradovich
the
decorations
received
by
this
or
that
general
and
their
own
speculations
and
the
question
of
those
fifty
thousand
men
left
in
hospitals
and
graves
does
not
even
interest
them
because
it
is
not
subject
to
their
study
and
yet
one
need
only
turn
from
the
study
of
reports
and
general
plans
and
look
into
the
movement
of
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
who
took
a
direct
immediate
the
event
and
all
the
questions
that
previously
seemed
insoluble
suddenly
with
extraordinary
ease
and
simplicity
receive
an
unquestionable
solution
the
aim
of
cutting
off
napoleon
and
his
army
never
existed
except
in
the
imaginations
of
several
dozen
people
it
could
not
exist
because
it
was
senseless
and
to
achieve
it
was
impossible
the
aim
of
the
people
was
one
to
clear
their
land
of
the
invasion
that
aim
was
being
achieved
first
of
all
by
itself
since
the
french
were
running
away
and
therefore
it
only
followed
that
this
movement
should
not
be
stopped
second
this
aim
was
achieved
by
the
actions
of
the
national
war
in
obliterating
the
french
and
third
by
the
fact
that
a
large
russian
army
was
following
the
french
ready
to
use
force
in
case
the
movement
of
the
french
stopped
the
russian
army
had
to
act
like
a
whip
on
a
running
animal
and
the
experienced
driver
knew
that
it
was
most
advantageous
to
hold
the
whip
raised
to
threaten
but
not
to
lash
the
running
animal
on
the
head
i
when
a
man
sees
a
dying
animal
horror
comes
over
him
that
which
he
himself
is
his
essence
is
obviously
being
annihilated
before
his
eyesis
ceasing
to
be
but
when
the
dying
one
is
a
person
and
a
beloved
person
then
besides
a
sense
of
horror
at
the
annihilation
of
life
there
is
a
feeling
of
severance
and
a
spiritual
wound
which
like
a
physical
wound
sometimes
kills
and
sometimes
heals
but
always
hurts
and
fears
any
external
irritating
touch
after
the
death
of
prince
andrei
natasha
and
princess
marya
equally
felt
that
morally
bowed
down
and
shutting
their
eyes
to
the
menacing
cloud
of
death
that
hung
over
them
they
did
not
dare
to
look
life
in
the
face
they
carefully
protected
their
open
wounds
from
any
offensive
painful
touch
everythinga
carriage
driving
quickly
down
the
street
a
reminder
of
dinner
a
maids
question
about
what
dress
to
prepare
still
worse
a
word
of
insincere
weak
sympathyeverything
painfully
irritated
the
wound
seemed
offensive
and
violated
the
necessary
quiet
in
which
they
both
tried
to
listen
to
the
dread
stern
choir
not
yet
silenced
in
their
imagination
and
prevented
them
from
peering
into
those
mysterious
infinite
distances
which
for
a
moment
had
opened
before
them
only
together
were
they
not
offended
or
pained
they
spoke
little
between
themselves
when
they
spoke
it
was
of
the
most
insignificant
subjects
they
both
equally
avoided
mentioning
anything
that
had
a
relation
to
the
future
to
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
a
future
seemed
to
them
an
offense
to
his
memory
still
more
carefully
did
they
avoid
in
their
conversations
all
that
might
have
a
relation
to
the
dead
man
it
seemed
to
them
that
what
they
had
lived
through
and
felt
could
not
be
expressed
in
words
it
seemed
to
them
that
any
mention
in
words
of
the
details
of
his
life
violated
the
majesty
and
sacredness
of
the
mystery
that
had
been
accomplished
before
their
eyes
a
continual
restraint
of
speech
a
constant
careful
avoidance
of
all
that
might
lead
to
words
about
him
these
halts
on
all
sides
at
the
border
of
what
could
not
be
spoken
of
brought
out
still
more
purely
and
clearly
in
their
imagination
what
they
both
felt
but
pure
perfect
sorrow
is
as
impossible
as
pure
and
perfect
joy
princess
marya
in
her
position
as
the
sole
independent
mistress
of
her
fate
the
guardian
and
instructor
of
her
nephew
was
the
first
to
be
called
away
by
life
from
the
world
of
sorrow
in
which
she
had
lived
for
the
first
two
weeks
she
received
letters
from
relations
which
had
to
be
answered
the
room
in
which
nikolenka
had
been
placed
was
damp
and
he
began
to
cough
alpatych
came
to
yaroslavl
with
business
reports
and
with
suggestions
and
advice
to
move
to
moscow
to
the
house
on
vzdvizhenka
which
had
remained
intact
and
only
needed
minor
repairs
life
did
not
stop
and
one
had
to
live
hard
as
it
was
for
princess
marya
to
leave
the
world
of
solitary
contemplation
in
which
she
had
lived
till
then
sorry
and
as
if
ashamed
as
she
was
to
leave
natasha
alone
the
cares
of
life
called
for
her
participation
and
she
involuntarily
surrendered
to
them
she
went
over
the
accounts
with
alpatych
consulted
with
dessales
about
her
nephew
and
gave
instructions
and
made
preparations
for
moving
to
moscow
natasha
remained
alone
and
once
princess
marya
began
preparing
for
departure
avoided
her
as
well
princess
marya
suggested
that
the
countess
allow
natasha
to
come
with
her
to
moscow
and
the
mother
and
father
gladly
accepted
this
suggestion
noticing
the
daily
decline
in
their
daughters
physical
strength
and
supposing
that
the
change
of
place
and
the
help
of
moscow
doctors
would
be
good
for
her
i
wont
go
anywhere
replied
natasha
when
the
suggestion
was
made
only
please
leave
me
alone
she
said
and
ran
out
of
the
room
barely
holding
back
her
tears
not
so
much
of
grief
as
of
vexation
and
anger
after
she
felt
herself
deserted
by
princess
marya
and
solitary
in
her
grief
natasha
spent
most
of
her
time
alone
in
her
room
sitting
with
her
legs
tucked
up
at
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
while
tearing
or
kneading
something
with
her
thin
tense
fingers
stared
with
an
intent
fixed
gaze
at
whatever
her
eyes
rested
on
the
solitude
exhausted
her
tormented
her
but
it
was
necessary
for
her
the
moment
someone
came
in
she
quickly
got
up
changed
her
position
and
the
expression
of
her
gaze
and
took
up
a
book
or
some
sewing
waiting
with
obvious
impatience
for
whoever
had
troubled
her
to
leave
it
kept
seeming
to
her
that
she
was
just
on
the
point
of
understanding
of
penetrating
that
terrible
overwhelming
question
at
which
her
inner
gaze
was
directed
at
the
end
of
december
natasha
in
a
black
woollen
dress
her
braid
carelessly
done
up
in
a
knot
thin
and
pale
was
sitting
with
her
legs
tucked
up
at
the
corner
of
the
sofa
tensely
crumpling
and
smoothing
out
the
ends
of
her
sash
and
looking
at
a
corner
of
the
door
she
was
looking
there
where
he
had
gone
to
the
other
side
of
life
and
that
side
of
life
of
which
she
had
never
thought
before
which
before
had
seemed
so
far
off
and
unbelievable
was
now
closer
and
dearer
more
comprehensible
to
her
than
this
side
of
life
where
everything
was
either
emptiness
and
ruin
or
suffering
and
offense
she
was
looking
there
where
she
knew
he
was
but
she
could
not
see
him
otherwise
than
as
he
had
been
here
she
saw
him
again
as
he
had
been
in
mytishchi
at
the
trinity
in
yaroslavl
she
saw
his
face
heard
his
voice
and
repeated
his
words
and
the
words
she
had
said
to
him
and
sometimes
she
invented
new
words
for
herself
and
for
him
which
might
have
been
said
then
here
he
is
lying
in
an
armchair
in
his
velvet
coat
his
head
propped
on
his
thin
pale
hand
his
chest
is
terribly
sunken
and
his
shoulders
are
hunched
his
lips
are
firmly
compressed
his
eyes
glitter
and
a
wrinkle
springs
up
and
then
disappears
on
his
pale
forehead
one
of
his
legs
trembles
rapidly
barely
noticeably
natasha
knows
that
he
is
struggling
with
tormenting
pain
what
is
this
pain
why
pain
what
is
he
feeling
how
it
hurts
him
thinks
natasha
he
noticed
her
attention
raised
his
eyes
and
without
smiling
began
to
speak
one
thing
is
terrible
he
had
said
it
is
to
bind
yourself
forever
to
a
suffering
man
that
is
eternal
torment
and
he
had
looked
at
hernatasha
could
see
it
nowwith
a
searching
gaze
natasha
as
always
had
answered
then
before
she
had
time
to
think
of
what
answer
she
would
give
it
cannot
go
on
like
this
it
wont
be
youll
get
wellcompletely
she
now
saw
him
anew
and
lived
through
all
she
had
felt
then
she
remembered
his
prolonged
sad
stern
gaze
at
those
words
and
understood
the
meaning
of
the
reproach
and
despair
in
that
prolonged
gaze
i
agreed
natasha
now
said
to
herself
that
it
would
be
terrible
if
he
was
left
suffering
always
i
said
it
then
only
because
it
would
be
terrible
for
him
but
he
understood
it
differently
he
thought
it
would
be
terrible
for
me
he
still
wanted
to
live
thenhe
was
afraid
of
death
and
i
said
it
to
him
so
crudely
so
stupidly
then
i
didnt
think
that
i
thought
quite
differently
if
i
had
said
what
i
thought
i
would
have
said
let
him
be
dying
dying
all
the
time
before
my
eyes
i
would
still
be
happy
compared
to
what
i
am
now
nowtheres
nothing
nobody
did
he
know
that
no
he
didnt
know
and
hell
never
know
and
now
it
will
never
never
be
possible
to
put
it
right
and
again
he
was
saying
the
same
words
to
her
but
now
in
her
imagination
natasha
answered
him
differently
she
stopped
him
and
said
terrible
for
you
but
not
for
me
you
know
that
for
me
there
is
nothing
in
life
without
you
and
to
suffer
with
you
is
the
best
happiness
for
me
and
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
as
he
had
pressed
it
on
that
terrible
evening
four
days
before
his
death
and
in
her
imagination
she
said
other
tender
loving
things
to
him
which
she
might
have
said
then
and
which
she
was
saying
now
i
love
youyoui
love
i
love
she
said
convulsively
pressing
her
hands
together
clenching
her
teeth
with
a
violent
effort
and
a
sweet
sorrow
came
over
her
and
tears
already
welled
up
in
her
eyes
but
suddenly
she
asked
herself
to
whom
is
she
saying
this
where
is
he
and
who
is
he
now
and
again
everything
was
veiled
in
a
dry
hard
perplexity
and
again
tensely
knitting
her
brows
she
peered
there
where
he
was
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
just
about
to
penetrate
the
mysterybut
at
the
moment
when
the
incomprehensible
seemed
about
to
be
revealed
her
hearing
was
painfully
struck
by
a
loud
rattling
of
the
door
handle
quickly
and
heedlessly
with
a
frightened
look
on
her
face
unconcerned
with
her
the
maid
dunyasha
came
into
the
room
please
go
to
your
father
quickly
said
dunyasha
with
a
peculiar
and
animated
expression
a
misfortune
about
pyotr
ilyicha
letter
she
said
with
a
sob
ii
besides
a
general
feeling
of
alienation
from
all
people
natasha
experienced
at
that
time
a
particular
feeling
of
alienation
from
the
persons
of
her
own
family
all
of
themher
father
her
mother
sonyawere
so
close
so
habitual
so
humdrum
that
all
their
words
and
feelings
seemed
to
her
an
insult
to
that
world
in
which
she
had
been
living
recently
and
she
was
not
only
indifferent
but
looked
at
them
with
hostility
she
heard
dunyashas
words
about
pyotr
ilyich
about
the
misfortune
but
she
did
not
understand
them
what
sort
of
misfortune
is
there
for
them
what
sort
of
misfortune
could
there
be
with
them
its
all
their
old
habitual
and
peaceful
thing
natasha
said
to
herself
when
she
entered
the
reception
room
her
father
was
quickly
coming
out
of
the
countesss
room
his
face
was
pinched
and
wet
with
tears
he
had
clearly
run
out
of
that
room
in
order
to
let
loose
the
sobs
that
were
choking
him
seeing
natasha
he
waved
his
arms
desperately
and
broke
into
painfully
convulsive
gasps
which
disfigured
his
round
soft
face
pepetyago
go
shesshescalling
and
weeping
like
a
child
quickly
moving
his
weakened
legs
he
went
over
to
a
chair
and
almost
fell
into
it
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
suddenly
it
was
as
if
an
electric
shock
ran
through
natashas
whole
being
something
hit
her
terribly
painfully
in
the
heart
she
felt
a
terrible
pain
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
had
torn
inside
her
and
she
was
dying
but
after
the
pain
she
suddenly
felt
free
of
the
ban
on
life
that
had
lain
on
her
seeing
her
father
and
hearing
her
mothers
terrible
coarse
cry
from
behind
the
door
she
instantly
forgot
herself
and
her
grief
she
ran
to
her
father
but
he
strengthlessly
waving
his
hand
pointed
at
the
door
to
her
mothers
room
princess
marya
pale
with
a
trembling
lower
jaw
came
out
of
the
door
and
took
natasha
by
the
hand
saying
something
to
her
natasha
did
not
see
did
not
hear
her
with
quick
steps
she
went
through
the
door
stopped
for
a
moment
as
if
struggling
with
herself
and
ran
to
her
mother
the
countess
was
lying
in
an
armchair
stretched
out
somehow
strangely
awkwardly
and
beating
her
head
against
the
wall
sonya
and
the
maids
were
holding
her
by
the
arms
natasha

placed

knee
on

chair
bent
over
her
mother
embraced
her
raised
her
with
unexpected
strength
turned
her
face
towards
her
and
pressed
herself
to
her
mamadarlingim
here
my
dearest
mama
she
whispered
to
her
not
pausing
for
a
second
she
would
not
let
go
of
her
mother
struggled
with
her
gently
called
for
pillows
water
unbuttoned
and
tore
open
her
mothers
dress
my
dearest

she
whispered
ceaselessly
kissing
her
head
hands
face
and
feeling
the
tears
flowing
irrepressibly
in
streams
tickling
her
nose
and
cheeks
the
countess
pressed
her
daughters
hand
closed
her
eyes
and
became
calm
for
a
moment
suddenly
with
an
unwonted
quickness
she
got
up
looked
around
senselessly
and
seeing
natasha
began
pressing
her
head
with
all
her
strength
then
she
turned
her
daughters
face
to
her
which
was
wincing
with
pain
and
peered
into
it
for
a
long
time
natasha
you
love
me
she
said
in
a
soft
trustful
whisper
natasha
you
wont
deceive
me
youll
tell
me
the
whole
truth
natasha
looked
at
her
with
tearfilled
eyes
and
there
was
nothing
in
her
face
but
a
plea
for
forgiveness
and
love
my
dearest
mama
she
repeated
straining
all
the
force
of
her
love
towards
her
so
as
to
somehow
shift
onto
herself
the
excess
of
grief
that
was
crushing
her
and
again
in
her
strengthless
struggle
with
reality
her
mother
by
refusing
to
believe
that
she
could
live
while
her
beloved
boy
had
been
killed
in
the
flower
of
life
tried
to
save
herself
from
reality
in
a
world
of
insanity
natasha
did
not
remember
how
that
day
passed
nor
the
night
the
next
day
the
next
night
she
did
not
sleep
and
did
not
leave
her
mothers
side
it
was
as
if
natashas
love
persistent
patient
not
as
an
explanation
not
as
a
consolation
but
as
a
summons
to
life
enveloped
the
countess
on
all
sides
every
second
on
the
third
night
the
countess
calmed
down
for
a
few
minutes
and
natasha
closed
her
eyes
resting
her
head
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
the
bed
creaked
natasha
opened
her
eyes
the
countess
was
sitting
on
the
bed
and
speaking
softly
im
so
glad
youve
come
youre
tired
would
you
like
some
tea
natasha
went
to
her
youve
grown
handsome
and
manly
the
countess
went
on
taking
her
daughter
by
the
hand
mama
what
are
you
saying
natasha
hes
no
more
no
more
and
embracing
her
daughter
for
the
first
time
the
countess
began
to
weep
iii
princess
marya
postponed
her
departure
sonya
and
the
count
tried
to
replace
natasha
but
could
not
they
saw
that
she
alone
could
keep
her
mother
from
insane
despair
for
three
weeks
natasha
was
constantly
with
her
mother
slept
in
the
armchair
in
her
room
made
her
drink
and
eat
and
talked
ceaselessly
with
hertalked
because
only
her
gentle
caressing
voice
could
soothe
the
countess
the
wound
in
the
mothers
soul
could
not
heal
petyas
death
tore
away
half
of
her
life
a
month
after
the
news
of
petyas
death
which
had
found
her
a
fresh
and
cheerful
fiftyyearold
woman
she
came
out
of
her
room
an
old
womanhalfdead
and
taking
no
life
but
the
same
wound
that
half
killed
the
countess
this
new
wound
called
natasha
to
life
a
wound
in
the
soul
coming
from
the
rending
of
the
spiritual
body
strange
as
it
may
seem
gradually
closes
like
a
physical
wound
and
once
a
deep
wound
heals
over
and
the
edges
seem
to
have
knit
a
wound
in
the
soul
like
a
physical
wound
can
be
healed
only
by
the
force
of
life
pushing
up
from
inside
this
was
the
way
natashas
wound
healed
she
thought
her
life
was
over
but
suddenly
her
love
for
her
mother
showed
her
that
the
essence
of
lifelovewas
still
alive
in
her
love
awoke
and
life
awoke
prince
andreis
last
days
had
bound
natasha
and
princess
marya
together
the
new
misfortune
brought
them
still
closer
princess
marya
postponed
her
departure
and
for
the
last
three
weeks
looked
after
natasha
like
a
sick
child
those
last
weeks
which
natasha
spent
in
her
mothers
room
undermined
her
physical
strength
once
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
noticing
that
natasha
was
shivering
feverishly
princess
marya
brought
her
to
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
on
her
bed
natasha
lay
down
but
when
princess
marya
lowered
the
blinds
and
was
about
to
leave
natasha
called
her
to
her

dont
want

nicely

said
princess
marya
natasha
lay
on
the
bed
and
studied
princess
maryas
face
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
room
does
she
resemble
him
thought
natasha
yes
she
does
and
doesnt
but
shes
special
a
stranger
quite
new
unknown
and
she
loves
me
whats
in
her
heart
all
good
things
but
how
how
does
she
think
how
does
she
look
at
me
yes

wonderful
masha
she
said
timidly
drawing
her
hand
towards
her
masha
you

im
bad
do
you
no
masha
darling
how
i
love
you
lets
be
best
best
friends
and
embracing
princess
marya
natasha
started
kissing
her
hands
and
face
princess
marya
was
abashed
and
overjoyed
at
this
expression
of
natashas
feelings
from
that
day
on
a
passionate
and
tender
friendship
was
established
between
princess
marya
and
natasha
such
as
occurs
only
between
women
they
constantly
kissed
each
other
spoke
tender
words
to
each
other
and
spent
most
of
their
time
together
if
one
went
out
the
other
became
uneasy
and
hastened
to
join
her
the
two
felt
a
greater
harmony
between
themselves
than
separately
each
with
herself
a
feeling
stronger
than
friendship
was
established
between
them
it
was
the
exceptional
feeling
that
life
was
possible
only
in
each
others
presence
sometimes
they
were
silent
for
hours
at
a
time
sometimes
already
in
bed
they
would
start
talking
and
talk
till
morning
they
talked
mostly
about
the
distant
past
princess
marya
told
about
her
childhood
about
her
mother
her
father
her
dreams
and
natasha
who
formerly
turned
away
with
calm
incomprehension
from
that
life
of
devotion
submission
from
the
poetry
of
christian
selfdenial
now
feeling
herself
bound
by
love
to
princess
marya
also
came
to
love
princess
maryas
past
and
to
understand
a
formerly
incomprehensible
side
of
life
she
did
not
think
of
applying
submission
and
selfdenial
to
her
own
life
because
she
was
used
to
seeking
other
joys
but
she
understood
and
came
to
love
this
formerly
incomprehensible
virtue
in
another
for
princess
marya
as
she
listened
to
the
stories
of
natashas
childhood
and
early
youth
a
formerly
incomprehensible
side
of
life
was
also
revealed
faith
in
life
in
the
pleasures
of
life
as
before
they
still
never
spoke
of
him
so
as
not
to
violate
with
words
as
it
seemed
to
them
that
lofty
feeling
that
was
in
them
and
this
silence
about
him
had
the
effect
that
little
by
little
without
believing
it
they
began
to
forget
him
natasha
had
grown
thin
pale
and
become
so
weak
physically
that
everyone
constantly
spoke
of
her
health
and
that
pleased
her
but
sometimes
she
was
unexpectedly
overcome
not
only
by
the
fear
of
death
but
by
the
fear
of
illness
weakness
the
loss
of
beauty
and
involuntarily
she
sometimes
studied
her
bare
arm
amazed
at
its
thinness
or
in
the
morning
contemplated
in
the
mirror
her
drawn
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
pathetic
face
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
ought
to
be
so
but
at
the
same
time
she
felt
afraid
and
sad
one
time
she
went
quickly
up
the
stairs
and
got
completely
out
of
breath
at
once
she
involuntarily
thought
up
for
herself
some
business
downstairs
and
from
there
ran
up
again
testing
her
strength
and
observing
herself
another
time
she
called
dunyasha
and
her
voice
sounded
cracked
she
called
her
once
more
though
she
heard
her
footstepscalled
in
that
chesty
voice
in
which
she
used
to
sing
and
listened
attentively
to
it
she
did
not
know
it
she
would
not
have
believed
it
but
under
the
seemingly
impenetrable
layer
of
silt
that
covered
her
soul
thin
tender
young
needles
of
grass
were
already
breaking
through
which
were
to
take
root
and
so
cover
with
their
living
shoots
the
grief
that
oppressed
her
that
it
would
soon
not
be
seen
or
noticed
the
wound
was
healing
from
inside
at
the
end
of
january
princess
marya
left
for
moscow
and
the
count
insisted
that
natasha
go
with
her
so
as
to
consult
the
doctors
iv
after
the
clash
at
vyazma
where
kutuzov
could
not
hold
back
his
troops
from
their
wish
to
overrun
cut
off
and
so
on
the
further
movement
of
the
fleeing
french
and
pursuing
russians
until
krasnoe
went
without
battles
the
flight
was
so
swift
that
the
pursuing
russian
army
could
not
keep
up
with
the
french
the
horses
of
the
cavalry
and
artillery
balked
and
the
information
about
the
movement
of
the
french
was
always
wrong
the
men
of
the
russian
army
were
so
exhausted
by
this
constant
movement
at
thirty
miles
a
day
that
they
could
move
no
faster
to
understand
the
degree
of
exhaustion
of
the
russian
army
one
need
only
understand
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
fact
that
having
lost
no
more
than
five
thousand
wounded
and
killed
since
tarutino
and
no
more
than
a
hundred
as
prisoners
the
russian
army
which
had
numbered
a
hundred
thousand
when
it
left
tarutino
numbered
fifty
thousand
when
it
reached
krasnoe
the
swift
movement
of
the
russians
after
the
french
had
the
same
disastrous
effect
on
the
russian
army
as
the
flight
of
the
french
on
theirs
the
only
difference
was
that
the
russian
army
moved
voluntarily
without
the
threat
of
destruction
which
hung
over
the
french
army
and
that
the
french
sick
lagging
behind
remained
in
the
foes
hands
while
the
russian
sick
remained
at
home
the
chief
cause
of
the
diminution
of
napoleons
army
was
the
swiftness
of
its
movement
and
the
corresponding
diminution
of
the
russian
army
serves
as
an
unquestionable
proof
of
it
kutuzovs
whole
activity
as
at
tarutino
and
vyazma
was
aimed
only
at
not
stopping
insofar
as
it
was
in
his
power
this
movement
so
destructive
for
the
french
as
the
russian
generals
in
petersburg
and
in
the
army
wanted
to
do
but
at
contributing
to
it
and
at
making
the
movement
of
his
own
troops
easier
but
besides
that
once
the
troops
had
shown
the
fatigue
and
enormous
losses
caused
by
swiftness
of
movement
kutuzov
had
one
more
reason
for
slowing
down
and
waiting
the
aim
of
the
russian
army
was
to
follow
the
french
the
path
of
the
french
was
unknown
and
therefore
the
more
closely
our
troops
followed
on
the
heels
of
the
french
the
greater
the
distance
they
covered
only
by
following
at
a
certain
distance
could
they
make
shortcuts
in
the
zigzag
path
the
french
took
all
the
skillful
maneuvering
proposed
by
the
generals
was
expressed
in
terms
of
moving
troops
and
multiplying
marches
while
the
only
reasonable
goal
consisted
in
diminishing
the
marches
and
it
was
towards
this
goal
that
kutuzovs
activity
was
directed
throughout
the
campaign
from
moscow
to
vilnonot
accidentally
not
temporarily
but
so
consistently
that
he
never
once
betrayed
it
kutuzov
knew
not
by
reason
or
science
but
with
all
his
russian
being
he
knew
and
felt
what
every
russian
soldier
felt
that
the
french
were
defeated
that
the
foe
was
fleeing
and
had
to
be
driven
out
but
along
with
that
he
felt
together
with
the
soldiers
all
the
difficulty
of
this
march
of
unheardof
swiftness
and
at
such
a
time
of
year
but
to
the
generals
especially
the
nonrussian
ones
who
wished
to
distinguish
themselves
to
astonish
someone
to
take
prisoner
god
knows
why
some
duke
or
kingto
these
generals
it
seemed
that
now
when
any
battle
was
both
nasty
and
senseless
was
just
the
right
time
to
give
battle
and
defeat
someone
or
other
kutuzov
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
presented
with
projects
one
after
another
for
maneuvers
involving
those
illshod
coatless
halfstarved
soldiers
who
in
a
month
without
any
battles
had
melted
away
by
half
and
who
under
the
best
conditions
for
the
continuing
flight
would
have
to
cover
more
space
to
reach
the
border
than
what
they
had
already
gone
through
this
striving
to
be
distinguished
and
to
maneuver
to
overrun
and
cut
off
was
especially
manifest
when
the
russian
troops
ran
across
the
french
it
happened
that
way
at
krasnoe
where
they
thought
they
would
find
one
of
the
three
french
columns
and
stumbled
onto
napoleon
himself
with
sixteen
thousand
men
despite
all
the
means
employed
by
kutuzov
to
avoid
this
disastrous
clash
and
spare
his
troops
the
wornout
men
of
the
russian
army
spent
three
days
at
krasnoe
finishing
off
the
beaten
mob
of
the
french
toll
wrote
a

so
on
and
as
always
everything
was
done
not
according
to
the
disposition

which
did
not

the

around
the
russians
by
night
scattered
hid
in
the
forests
and
made
their
way
each
man
as
he
could
miloradovich

used
to
say
that
he
did
not
want
to

anything
about

of

who
could
never
be
found
when
he
was
needed
chevalier

as
he
called
himself
and
a
great
lover
of
parleys
with
the
french
kept
sending
envoys
calling
for
surrender
and
lost
time
and
did
not
do
what
he
was
ordered
to
do
i
make
you
a
gift
of
that
column
lads
he
would
say
riding
up
to
the
troops
and
pointing
out
the
french
to
his
cavalrymen
and
the
cavalrymen
urging
on
their
scrawny
battered
barely
moving
horses
with
spurs
and
sabers
after
mighty
exertions
trotted
up
to
the
column
given
to
them
that
is
to
a
crowd
of
frostbitten
numbwithcold
and
hungry
frenchmen
and
the
column
given
to
them
dropped
its
weapons
and
surrendered
something
it
had
long
been
wanting
to
do
at
krasnoe
they
took
twentysix
thousand
prisoners
hundreds
of
cannon
some
stick
which
was
called
a
marshals
baton
and
disputed
over
who
had
distinguished
himself
there
and
were
pleased
with
that
but
very
much
regretted
that
they
had
not
taken
napoleon
or
at
least
some
hero
or
marshal
and
for
that
reproached
each
other
and
especially
kutuzov
these
people
carried
away
by
their
passions
were
merely
the
blind
executors
of
the
most
grievous
law
of
necessity
but
they
considered
themselves
heroes
and
imagined
that
what
they
had
done
was
a
most
worthy
and
noble
thing
they
accused
kutuzov
and
said
that
from
the
very
start
of
the
campaign
he
had
prevented
them
from
defeating
napoleon
that
he
thought
only
about
satisfying
his
passions
and
did
not
want
to
leave
polotnyany
zavody
because
he
felt
comfortable
there
that
he
had
stopped
moving
at
krasnoe
because
having
learned
of
napoleons
presence
he
was
completely
at
a
loss
that
it
was
conceivable
that
he
was
in
conspiracy
with
napoleon
that
he
had
been
bribed
by
him
and
so
on
and
so
forth
it
is
not
enough
that
contemporaries
carried
away
by
their
passions
spoke
this
waynapoleon
has
been
recognized
as
grand
by
posterity
and
history
and
kutuzov
by
the
foreigners
as
a
cunning
depraved
feeble
old
courtier
by
the
russians
as
something
indefinite
a
sort
of
puppet
useful
only
because
of
his
russian
name
v
in
the
years
twelve
and
thirteen
kutuzov
was
directly
accused
of
blunders
the
sovereign
was
displeased
with
him
and
in
a
history
written
not
long
ago
at
the
highest
injunction
it
is
said
that
kutuzov
was
a
cunning
court
liar
fearful
of
the
name
of
napoleon
who
through
his
blunders
at
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
deprived
the
russian
army
of
the
glory
of
a
complete
victory
over
the
french
such
is
the
destiny
not
of
great
men
not
of
the
grands
hommes
whom
the
russian
mind
does
not
recognize
but
of
those
rare
always
solitary
men
who
discerning
the
will
of
providence
submit
their
personal
will
to
it
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
crowd
punish
these
men
for
their
insight
into
the
higher
law
for
russian
historiansstrange
and
terrible
to
saynapoleon
that
most
insignificant
instrument
of
history
who
never
and
nowhere
even
in
exile
displayed
any
human
dignitynapoleon
is
the
object
of
admiration
and
enthusiasm
he
is
grand
while
kutuzov
a
man
who
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
activity
in
1812
from
borodino
to
vilno
while
always
being
true
to
himself
in
all
his
acts
and
words
shows
an
example
uncommon
in
history
of
selfdenial
and
awareness
in
the
present
of
the
future
significance
of
the
eventkutuzov
seems
to
them
something
indefinite
and
pathetic
and
when
they
speak
of
kutuzov
and
the
year
twelve
it
is
as
if
they
are
always
slightly
embarrassed
and
yet
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
historical
figure
whose
activity
was
so
invariably
and
constantly
directed
towards
one
and
the
same
goal
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
goal
more
worthy
and
more
concurrent
with
the
will
of
the
whole
people
it
is
harder
still
to
find
another
example
in
history
in
which
the
goal
that
the
historical
figure
set
for
himself
was
so
perfectly
attained
as
the
goal
towards
which
the
entire
activity
of
kutuzov
was
directed
in
the
year
twelve
kutuzov
never
spoke
of
forty
centuries
looking
down
from
the
pyramids
of
the
sacrifices
he
was
making
for
the
fatherland
of
what
he
intended
to
accomplish
or
had
accomplished
he
generally
said
nothing
about
himself
did
not
play
any
role
always
seemed
a
most
simple
and
ordinary
man
and
said
the
most
simple
and
ordinary
things
he
wrote
letters
to
his
daughters
and
to
mme
de
sta235l
read
novels
enjoyed
the
society
of
beautiful
women
joked
with
generals
officers
and
soldiers
and
never
contradicted
people
who
wanted
to
prove
something
to
him
when
count
rastopchin
galloped
up
to
kutuzov
on
the
yauza
bridge
with
personal
reproaches
blaming
him
for
the
destruction
of
moscow
and
said
didnt
you
promise
not
to
abandon
moscow
without
giving
battlekutuzov
replied
and
i
wont
abandon
moscow
without
a
battle
though
by
then
moscow
had
already
been
abandoned
when
arakcheev
coming
to
him
from
the
sovereign
said
that
ermolov
must
be
appointed
commander
of
the
artillery
kutuzov
said
yes
i
just
said
the
same
thingthough
the
moment
before
he
had
said
something
quite
different
what
did
he
care
who
amidst
the
muddleheaded
crowd
around
him
alone
then
understood
all
the
immense
meaning
of
the
event
what
did
he
care
if
count
rastopchin
attributed
the
calamity
of
moscow
to
him
or
to
himself
still
less
could
he
be
concerned
about
who
was
appointed
commander
of
the
artillery
not
only
in
these
cases
but
constantly
this
old
man
who
through
the
experience
of
life
had
reached
the
conviction
that
thoughts
and
the
words
which
serve
to
express
them
are
not
what
move
people
spoke
completely
meaningless
wordsthe
first
that
came
to
his
head
but
this
same
man
so
heedless
of
his
words
never
once
in
all
his
activity
spoke
a
single
word
that
was
not
consistent
with
the
one
goal
towards
the
attainment
of
which
he
went
during
the
whole
time
of
the
war
obviously
unwillingly
with
the
painful
certainty
that
he
would
not
be
understood
he
voiced
his
thought
more
than
once
in
the
most
varied
circumstances
starting
from
the
battle
of
borodino
when
his
dissension
with
his
entourage
began
he
alone
said
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
a
victory
and
he
repeated
it
orally
and
in
reports
and
in
dispatches
till
the
day
he
died
he
alone
said
that
the
loss
of
moscow
was
not
the
loss
of
russia
in
response
to
lauristons
proposal
of
peace
he
replied
that
there
could
be
no
peace
because
such
was
the
will
of
the
people
he
alone
during
the
french
retreat
said
that
all
our
maneuvers
are
unnecessary
that
everything
was
getting
done
by
itself
better
than
we
could
wish
that
the
enemy
should
be
given
a
golden
bridge
that
the
battles
of
tarutino
vyazma
and
krasnoe
were
unnecessary
that
they
had
to
have
some
men
left
when
they
got
to
the
border
that
he
would
not
give
up
one
russian
even
for
ten
frenchmen
and
he
alone
this
courtier
as
they
portray
him
for
us
the
man
who
lied
to
arakcheev
in
order
to
curry
favor
with
the
sovereignhe
alone
this
courtier
says
in
vilno
thereby
earning
disgrace
from
the
sovereign
that
a
further
war
beyond
the
border
is
harmful
and
useless
but
words
alone
would
not
prove
that
he
then
understood
the
significance
of
the
event
his
actionsall
without
the
least
deviationwere
directed
towards
one
and
the
same
goal
which
was
made
up
of
three
things
1
to
strain
all
his
forces
in
the
clash
with
the
french
2
to
defeat
them
and
3
to
drive
them
out
of
russia
alleviating
as
far
as
possible
the
distress
of
the
people
and
the
army
he
this
temporizer
kutuzov
whose
motto
is
patience
and
time
the
enemy
of
decisive
actions
gives
battle
at
borodino
clothing
the
preparations
for
it
in
unparalleled
solemnity
he
this
kutuzov
who
before
the
battle
of
austerlitz
begins
says
it
will
be
lost
at
borodino
despite
the
assurances
of
the
generals
that
the
battle
has
been
lost
despite
the
example
unheardof
in
history
of
an
army
having
to
retreat
after
winning
a
battle
he
alone
contradicting
everyone
maintains
till
his
dying
day
that
the
battle
of
borodino
was
a
victory
he
alone
during
the
whole
time
of
the
retreat
insists
on
not
giving
battle
which
was
now
useless
on
not
beginning
a
new
war
on
not
crossing
the
borders
of
russia
if
we
do
not
apply
to
the
activity
of
the
masses
goals
that
existed
only
in
the
heads
of
a
few
dozen
persons
it
is
easy
now
to
understand
the
significance
of
the
event
because
the
whole
event
and
its
consequences
lie
before
us
but
how
was
it
that
this
old
man
alone
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
all
could
then
guess
so
correctly
the
significance
of
the
national
meaning
of
the
event
that
during
his
whole
activity
he
never
once
betrayed
it
the
source
of
this
extraordinary
power
of
penetration
into
the
meaning
of
events
taking
place
lay
in
that
national
feeling
which
he
bore
within
himself
in
all
its
purity
and
force
only
the
recognition
of
that
feeling
in
him
made
the
people
choose
him
in
such
a
strange
wayhim
an
old
man
in
disgraceagainst
the
will
of
the
tsar
as
representative
of
the
national
war
and
only
that
feeling
placed
him
on
that
loftiest
human
height
from
which
he
the
commander
in
chief
directed
all
his
powers
not
at
killing
and
destroying
people
but
at
sparing
and
pitying
them
this
simple
modest
and
therefore
truly
majestic
figure
could
not
fit
into
that
false
form
of
the
european
hero
the
imaginary
ruler
of
the
people
which
history
has
invented
for
a
lackey
there
can
be
no
great
man
because
a
lackey
has
his
own
idea
of
greatness
vi
the
fifth
of
november
was
the
first
day
of
the
socalled
battle
of
krasnoe
before
evening
already
after
many
disputes
and
mistakes
of
the
generals
who
had
not
gone
where
they
were
supposed
to
after
the
sending
out
of
adjutants
with
counterorders
when
it
had
already
become
clear
that
the
enemy
was
fleeing
everywhere
and
there
could
not
and
would
not
be
any
battle
kutuzov
left
krasnoe
and
rode
to
dobroe
where
the
headquarters
had
been
transferred
that
day
the
day
was
clear
frosty
kutuzov
with
an
enormous
suite
of
generals
who
were
displeased
with
him
and
whispered
behind
his
back
rode
towards
dobroe
mounted
on
his
fat
white
horse
parties
of
french
prisoners
taken
that
day
seven
thousand
had
been
taken
crowded
along
the
road
warming
up
by
fires
not
far
from
dobroe
an
enormous
crowd
of
ragged
prisoners
wrapped
and
covered
up
in
whatever
they
could
find
buzzed
with
talk
standing
on
the
road
by
a
long
line
of
unhitched
french
guns
as
the
commander
in
chief
approached
the
talk
ceased
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
kutuzov
who
in
his
white
cap
with
the
red
band
and
a
padded
greatcoat
that
hunched
up
on
his
stooping
shoulders
slowly
moved
along
the
road
one
of
the
generals
was
reporting
to
kutuzov
about
where
the
guns
and
prisoners
had
been
taken
kutuzov
seemed
to
be
preoccupied
with
something
and
was
not
listening
to
the
generals
words
he
narrowed
his
eyes
with
displeasure
and
peered
attentively
and
fixedly
at
the
figures
of
the
prisoners
who
were
a
particularly
pathetic
sight
the
greater
the
french
soldiers
faces
were
disfigured
by
frostbitten
noses
and
cheeks
and
almost
all
of
them
had
red
swollen
and
festering
eyes
one
bunch
of
frenchmen
was
standing
close
to
the
road
and
two
soldiersthe
face
of
one
was
covered
with
soreswere
tearing
a
piece
of
raw
meat
with
their
hands
there
was
something
terrible
and
animallike
in
the
fleeting
glance
they
cast
at
the
passersby
and
in
the
spiteful
expression
with
which
the
soldier
with
the
sores
having
glanced
at
kutuzov
immediately
turned
away
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
doing
kutuzov
gazed
long
and
attentively
at
these
two
soldiers
wrinkling
his
face
still
more
he
narrowed
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
pensively
in
another
place
he
noticed
a
russian
soldier
who
was
saying
something
affectionately
to
a
frenchman
laughing
and
patting
him
on
the
back
kutuzov
again
shook
his
head
with
the
same
expression
what
were
you
saying
whats
that
he
asked
the
general
who
went
on
reporting
and
was
drawing
the
commander
in
chiefs
attention
to
the
captured
french
standards
that
stood
in
front
of
the
preobrazhensky
regiment
ah
standards
said
kutuzov
clearly
having
difficulty
tearing
himself
away
from
the
subject
that
occupied
his
thoughts
he
looked
around
absentmindedly
thousands
of
eyes
were
looking
at
him
from
all
sides
waiting
for
a
word
from
him
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
preobrazhensky
regiment
sighed
deeply
and
closed
his
eyes
someone
from
the
suite
waved
to
the
soldiers
holding
the
standards
to
come
and
place
them
staffdown
around
the
commander
in
chief
kutuzov
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
with
evident
reluctance
submitting
to
the
necessity
of
his
position
raised
his
head
and
began
to
speak
crowds
of
officers
surrounded
him
he
gazed
attentively
at
the
circle
of
officers
recognizing
some
of
them
i
thank
you
all
he
said
turning
to
the
soldiers
and
again
to
the
officers
in
the
silence
that
reigned
around
him
his
slowly
articulated
words
could
be
heard
distinctly
i
thank
you
all
for
your
difficult
and
faithful
service
the
victory
is
complete
and
russia
will
not
forget
you
glory
to
you
forever
he
paused
looking
around
lower
it
lower
its
head
he
said
to
a
soldier
who
was
holding
the
french
eagle
and
had
inadvertently
inclined
it
before
the
preobrazhensky
standards
further
further
like
that
hurrah
lads
he
said
with
a
quick
movement
of
his
chin
addressing
the
soldiers
hurrararah
thousands
of
voices
roared
while
the
soldiers
were
shouting
kutuzov
hunching
up
on
his
saddle
bent
his
head
and
his
eye
lit
up
with
a
meek
as
if
mocking
glint
heres
the
thing
brothers
he
said
when
the
voices
died
down
and
suddenly
his
voice
and
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
it
was
no
longer
a
commander
in
chief
speaking
but
a
simple
old
man
who
obviously
now
wished
to
tell
his
comrades
something
they
needed
most
of
all
there
was
a
movement
in
the
crowd
of
officers
and
in
the
ranks
of
soldiers
so
that
they
could
hear
more
clearly
what
he
was
going
to
say
now
heres
the
thing
brothers
i
know
its
hard
for
you
but
whats
to
be
done
be
patient
it
wont
last
long
well
see
our
guests
off
then
well
have
a
rest
the
tsar
will
not
forget
your
service
its
hard
for
you
but
still
youre
at
home
but
theysee
what
theyve
come
to
he
said
pointing
to
the
prisoners
worse
than
the
lowest
beggars
while
they
were
strong
we
took
no
pity
on
ourselves
but
now
we
can
pity
them
theyre
also
people
right
lads
he
looked
around
and
in
the
intent
respectfully
puzzled
eyes
directed
at
him
he
read
sympathy
with
his
words
his
face
began
to
grow
brighter
and
brighter
starting
from
the
old
mans
meek
smile
that
wrinkled
starlike
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
he
paused
and
hung
his
head
as
if
in
perplexity
but
that
said
who
invited
them
here
its
their
own
doing
fthin
the
f
he
suddenly
said
raising
his
head
and
swinging
his
whip
he
rode
off
at
a
gallop
for
the
first
time
in
the
whole
campaign
while
the
soldiers
breaking
ranks
joyfully
guffawed
and
roared
hurrah
the
words
spoken
by
kutuzov
were
hardly
understood
by
the
troops
no
one
would
have
been
able
to
convey
the
contents
of
the
field
marshals
at
first
solemn
and
in
the
end
simplehearted
old
mans
speech
but
the
heartfelt
meaning
of
that
speech
was
not
only
understood
but
that
same
feeling
of
majestic
triumph
combined
with
pity
for
the
foe
and
the
consciousness
of
his
rightness
expressed
precisely
by
that
old
mans
goodnatured
oaththat
same
feeling
lay
in
the
soul
of
every
soldier
and
expressed
itself
in
a
joyful
longdrawn
shout
when
after
that
one
of
the
generals
addressed
him
with
the
question
whether
the
commander
in
chief
would
be
ordering
a
carriage
brought
kutuzov
in
answering
sobbed
unexpectedly
evidently
deeply
moved
vii
the
eighth
of
november
the
last
day
of
the
battles
at
krasnoe
it
was
already
dark
when
the
troops
came
to
their
night
camp
the
whole
day
had
been
quiet
frosty
with
light
sparse
snow
falling
towards
evening
it
began
to
clear
the
deep
purple
starry
sky
could
be
seen
through
the
snowflakes
and
the
frost
began
to
deepen
the
musketeer
regiment
which
on
leaving
tarutino
had
numbered
three
thousand
now
numbering
nine
hundred
men
was
one
of
the
first
to
come
to
the
place
appointed
for
the
night
camp
in
a
village
by
the
high
road
the
quartermasters
who
met
the
regiment
announced
that
all
the
cottages
were
taken
up
by
sick
and
dead
frenchmen
cavalrymen
and
staff
there
was
only
one
cottage
for
the
regimental
commander
the
regimental
commander
rode
up
to
his
cottage
the
regiment
went
through
the
village
and
stacked
muskets
by
the
last
cottage
on
the
road
like
a
huge
manylimbed
animal
the
regiment
began
the
work
of
arranging
its
den
and
food
one
the
soldiers
wandered
off
through
kneedeep
snow
into
a
birch
woods
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
at
once
the
chopping
of
axes
and
swords
the
crack
of
breaking
branches
and
merry
voices
were
heard
from
the
woods
another
around
the
center
of
the
regimental
carts
and
horses
bunched
together
taking
out
pots
biscuits
and
feeding
the
horses
a
third
through
the
village
arranging
lodgings
for
the
staff
carrying
away
the
dead
bodies
of
the
french
that
lay
in
the
cottages
and
collecting
boards
dry
wood
and
straw
from
the
roofs
for
campfires
and
wattle
fences
for
shelter
behind
the
cottages
at
the
edge
of
the
village
some
fifteen
soldiers
with
merry
shouts
were
loosening
the
high
wattle
side
of
a
shed
from
which
the
roof
had
already
been
removed
ready
now
all
at
once
heave
cried
the
voices
and
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
a
huge
snowdusted
section
of
the
wall
swayed
with
a
frosty
creaking
the
lower
stakes
cracked
more
and
more
and
the
wall
finally
fell
over
together
with
the
soldiers
pushing
on
it
there
were
loud
coarsely
joyful
shouts
and
guffaws
take
it
by
twos
reach
me
that
leever
here
thats
it
where
are
you
shoving
now
all
at
oncewait
up
ladsat
the
shout
they
all
fell
silent
and
a
soft
velvety
pleasant
voice
began
singing
a
song
at
the
end
of
the
third
verse
just
as
the
last
sound
ended
twenty
voices
shouted
out
together
hooo
here
goes
all
at
once
up
with
it
boys
but
despite
their
concerted
efforts
the
wall
hardly
budged
and
in
the
ensuing
silence
heavy
panting
could
be
heard
hey
you
sixth
company
damn
you
devils
give
us
a
handwell
also
do
for
you
some
twenty
men
of
the
sixth
company
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
village
joined
the
haulers
and
the
wattle
wall
about
thirtyfive
feet
long
and
seven
feet
high
curving
crushing
and
cutting
the
shoulders
of
the
panting
men
moved
on
down
the
village
street
keep

fallingwhat

thats
it
the
merry
outrageous
cursing
never

suddenly
came
the
commanding
voice
of
a
soldier
who
ran
into
the
carriers

the
generl
himselfs
in
the
cottage
and
you
damned
foulmouthed
devilsill

cried
the
sergeant
major
and
he
swung
and
struck
the
first
soldier
who
came
along
on
the
back
cant
you
do
it
quietly
the
soldiers
fell
silent
the
soldier
struck
by
the
sergeant
major
groaning
began
to
wipe
the
blood
from
his
face
which
he
had
scratched
as
he
bumped
against
the
wall
see
how
the
devil
fights
my
mugs
all
bloody
he
said
in
a
timid
whisper
when
the
sergeant
major
had
walked
on
dont
you
love
it
said
a
laughing
voice
and
holding
down
the
sounds
of
their
voices
the
soldiers
went
on
once
outside
the
village
they
again
began
to
talk
just
as
loudly
interspersing
their
talk
with
the
same
pointless
curses
in
the
cottage
that
the
soldiers
had
passed
the
high
command
had
gathered
and
a
lively
conversation
was
going
on
over
tea
about
the
past
day
and
the
proposed
maneuvers
to
come
it
was
proposed
to
make
a
flanking
march
to
the
left
to
cut
off
the
viceroy
and
capture
him
when
the
soldiers
came
lugging
the
wattle
wall
the
cook
fires
were
already
kindled
in
various
places
the
firewood
crackled
the
snow
melted
and
the
black
shadows
of
soldiers
darted
here
and
there
on
the
trampled
snow
all
over
the
occupied
space
axes
and
swords
were
at
work
on
all
sides
everything
got
done
without
any
orders
a
supply
of
firewood
was
brought
for
the
night
little
leantos
were
set
up
for
the
officers
pots
boiled
guns
and
ammunition
were
put
in
order
the
wattle
wall
brought
by
the
eighth
company
was
set
up
in
a
half
circle
on
the
north
side
propped
with
stakes
and
a
campfire
was
built
in
front
of
it
they
beat
the
tattoo
called
the
roll
ate
supper
and
settled
for
the
night
by
the
campfiressome
mending
their
footgear
some
smoking
their
pipes
some
stripped
naked
steaming
out
lice
viii
it
would
seem
that
in
those
almost
unimaginably
hard
conditions
of
existence
in
which
the
russian
soldiers
found
themselves
at
that
timewithout
warm
boots
without
winter
coats
without
a
roof
over
their
heads
in
the
snow
at
eighteen
degrees
of
frost
without
even
a
full
ration
of
provisions
which
did
not
always
keep
up
with
the
armyit
would
seem
that
the
soldiers
must
present
a
very
sad
and
dejected
spectacle
on
the
contrary
never
in
the
very
best
material
conditions
did
an
army
present
a
more
cheerful
lively
spectacle
that
came
from
the
fact
that
each
day
all
those
who
began
to
lose
heart
or
strength
were
thrown
out
of
the
army
all
those
who
were
physically
and
morally
weak
had
long
since
stayed
behind
leaving
only
the
flower
of
the
armyin
strength
of
spirit
and
body
the
eighth
company
sheltered
by
the
wattle
wall
gathered
the
most
people
of
all
two
sergeants
major
joined
them
and
their
campfire
blazed
brighter
than
the
others
they
demanded
an
offering
of
firewood
for
the
right
to
sit
by
the
wall
hey
makeev
youdid
you
get
lost
or
did
the
wolves
eat
you
fetch
that
firewood
shouted
a
redmugged
redheaded
soldier
squinting
and
blinking
from
the
smoke
but
not
moving
away
from
the
fire
crow
you
go
at
least
and
fetch
some
firewood
this
soldier
addressed
someone
else
the
redhead
was
not
a
sergeant
or
a
corporal
but
he
was
a
lusty
soldier
and
therefore
ordered
about
those
who
were
weaker
than
he
the
skinny
small
sharpnosed
soldier
who
had
been
called
crow
obediently
got
up
and
was
about
to
go
and
carry
out
the
order
but
just
then
the
slender
handsome
figure
of
a
young
soldier
carrying
a
load
of
firewood
came
into
the
light
of
the
campfire
give
it
here
thats
great
the
wood
was
broken
up
laid
on
blown
at
fanned
with
the
skirts
of
greatcoats
and
the
flames
hissed
and
crackled
the
soldiers
moved
up
and
lit
their
pipes
the
handsome
young
soldier
who
had
brought
the
firewood
set
his
arms
akimbo
and
began
stamping
his
chilled
feet
quickly
and
deftly
in
place
cold
is
the
dew
ah
mother
dear
how
good
ill
be
a
musketeer
he
sang
along
as
if
hiccuping
at
each
syllable
of
the
song
hey
your
solesll
fly
off
cried
the
redhead
noticing
that
one
of
the
dancers
soles
was
loose
swallowed
dancing
poison
the
dancer
stopped
tore
off
the
loose
piece
of
leather
and
threw
it
in
the
fire
right
you
are
brother
he
said
and
sitting
down
he
took
a
scrap
of
blue
french
broadcloth
from
his
pack
and
began
wrapping
his
foot
in
it
its
the
steam
does
it
he
added
stretching
out
his
feet
to
the
fire
well
get
new
ones
soon
they
say
when
weve
killed
them
off
well
all
get
double
the
goods
and
see
that
son
of
a
bitch
petrov
fell
behind
all
right
said
one
sergeant
major
ive
had
an
eye
on
him
for
a
long
time
said
the
other
some
soldier
boy
and
in
the
third
company
i
heard
there
were
nine
men
missing
yesterday
yes
but
figure
once
your
feet
are
frozen
how
are
you
going
to
walk
eh
empty
chatter
said
the
sergeant
major
or
do
you
want
the
same
thing
said
an
old
soldier
turning
reproachfully
to
the
one
who
had
talked
about
frozen
feet
and
what
do
you
think
the
sharpnosed
soldier
known
as
crow
began
in
a
squeaky
and
trembling
voice
suddenly
rising
up
from
behind
the
campfire
a
sleek
man
gets
thin
but
for
a
thin
man
its
death
me
for
instance
i
cant
stand
it
anymore
he
suddenly
said
resolutely
turning
to
the
sergeant
major
order
me
sent
to
the
hospital
i
hurt
all
over
ill
fall
behind
anyway
well
thatll
do
thatll
do
the
sergeant
major
said
calmly
the
little
soldier
fell
silent
and
the
conversation
went
on
quite
a
few
of
these
frenchmen
got
taken
today
but
to
say
it
straight
out
not
a
one
had
a
real
pair
of
boots
on
just
in
name
only
one
of
the
soldiers
began
a
new
subject
the
cossacks
always
take
them
when
we
cleaned
the
cottage
for
the
colonel
we
carried
some
of
them
out
its
a
pity
to
see
lads
said
the
dancer
we
unwrapped
them
one
was
still
alive
believe
me
he
babbled
something
in
his
own
talk
but
theyre
clean
folk
lads
said
the
first
white
white
as
that
birch
and
gallant
you
might
say
noble
fellows
but
what
did
you
think
he
has
them
recruited
from
all
the
classes
but
they
dont
know
anything
of
our
talk
the
dancer
said
with
a
perplexed
smile
i
say
to
him
whose
crown
are
you
under
and
he
babbles
in
his
own
way
funny
folk
theres
this
puzzler
brothers
the
one
who
had
been
surprised
at
their
whiteness
went
on
the
muzhiks
at
mozhaisk
said
when
they
started
clearing
away
the
dead
where
the
battle
was
so
you
can
reckon
its
a
whole
month
their
dead
were
lying
thereso
they
say
some
of
thems
lying
there
they
say
white
as
paper
clean
not
a
whiff
off
them
what
from
the
cold
or
something
asked
one
a
smart
one
you
are
from
the
cold
it
was
hot
then
if
itd
been
from
the
cold
ours
wouldnt
have
gone
bad
either
but
they
say
you
go
up
to
one
of
ours
and
hes
all
rotten
and
wormy
so
they
say
wed
cover
ourselves
with
handkerchiefs
and
turn
our
mugs
away
as
we
dragged
them
out
couldnt
stand
it
but
theirs
they
saywhite
as
paper
not
a
whiff
off
them
they
all
fell
silent
must
be
the
food
said
the
sergeant
major
they
ate
gentrys
grub
nobody
objected
that
muzhik
was
telling
the
one
there
at
mozhaisk
where
the
battle
was
it
took
ten
villages
to
cart
them
off
and
they
were
twenty
days
at
it
and
there
were
still
some
dead
left
there
were
so
many
wolves
they
say
that
was
a
real
battle
said
the
old
soldier
so
theres
something
to
remember
but
everything
afterits
just
only
to
make
folk
suffer
thats
right
uncle
two
days
ago
we
made
a
rush
but
nothing
doing
they
wouldnt
let
us
get
at
them
dropped
their
muskets

fell
on
their
knees
pardon
they
say
thats
just
one
example
they
say
platov
took
poleon
himself
twice

know
a
word
so
they
take
him
he
turns
into
a
bird
in
their
hands
and
flies
away
just

and
theres
also
no
permit

him

lyingits
the
real
truth
if

the
ground
and
put
an
aspen
stake
through
him
hes
destroyed
a
lot
of
folk
well
put
an
end
to
him
one
way
or
another
he
wont
be
around
long
the
old
soldier
said
yawning
the
conversation
ceased
the
soldiers
began
settling
down
to
sleep
look
at
the
stars
burning
away
something
awful
youd
say
it
was
women
spreading
sheets
a
soldier
said
admiring
the
milky
way
that
means
a
good
harvest
this
year
well
need
more
firewood
you
warm
your
back
and
your
belly
gets
cold
its
funny
oh
lord
what
are
you
shoving
foris
the
fire
just
for
you
alone
or
something
look
at
himsprawling
silence
was
now
setting
in
and
several
sleepers
could
be
heard
snoring
the
others
turned
and
warmed
themselves
occasionally
exchanging
words
from
a
campfire
some
hundred
paces
away
came
a
chorus
of
merry
guffaws
look
how
theyre
roaring
in
the
fifth
company
said
one
soldier
and
so
many
folkits
awful
one
soldier
got
up
and
went
to
the
fifth
company
theyre
having
fun
there
he
said
coming
back
two
frenchmen
have
joined
them
ones
completely
frozen
but
the
others
pretty
frisky
hes
playing
songs
oh
lets
go
see
several
soldiers
went
over
to
the
fifth
company
ix
the
fifth
company
was
camped
just
by
the
forest
an
enormous
campfire
burned
brightly
amidst
the
snow
lighting
up
the
boughs
of
the
trees
heavy
with
hoarfrost
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
soldiers
of
the
fifth
company
had
heard
footsteps
in
the
snow
of
the
forest
and
the
cracking
of
twigs
thats
a
bear
lads
said
one
soldier
they
all
raised
their
heads
and
listened
and
from
the
forest
two
human
figures
emerged
into
the
bright
light
of
the
fire
holding
on
to
each
other
and
strangely
dressed
they
were
two
frenchmen
who
had
been
hiding
in
the
forest
saying
something
hoarsely
in
a
language
the
soldiers
did
not
understand
they
came
up
to
the
fire
one
was
taller
wearing
an
officers
hat
and
looked
quite
weak
coming
to
the
fire
he
wanted
to
sit
down
but
fell
to
the
ground
the
other
a
small
stocky
soldier
his
cheeks
tied
round
with
a
kerchief
was
stronger
he
lifted
up
his
comrade
and
pointing
to
his
mouth
said
something
the
soldiers
surrounded
the
frenchmen
laid
the
sick
man
on
an
overcoat
and
brought
some
kasha
and
vodka
for
them
both
the
weak
french
officer
was
ramballe
the
one
tied
round
with
a
kerchief
was
his
orderly
morel
when
morel
had
drunk
some
vodka
and
finished
a
mess
tin
of
kasha
he
suddenly
became
morbidly
merry
and
began
rattling
something
out
to
the
soldiers
who
did
not
understand
him
ramballe
refused
to
eat
and
lay
silently
by
the
fire
propped
on
his
elbow
looking
at
the
russian
soldiers
with
vacant
red
eyes
from
time
to
time
he
let
out
a
long
moan
and
fell
silent
again
morel
pointing
to
his
shoulders
tried
to
bring
it
home
to
the
soldiers
that
this
was
an
officer
and
that
he
needed
to
get
warm
a
russian
officer
who
came
up
to
the
fire
sent
to
the
colonel
to
ask
if
he
would
take
in
a
french
officer
to
get
warm
the
answer
came
back
that
the
colonel
ordered
the
officer
brought
ramballe
was
told
to
go
he
stood
up
and
tried
to
walk
but
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
if
a
soldier
standing
beside
him
had
not
supported
him
what
you
dont
want
to
one
soldier
said
addressing
ramballe
with
a
mocking
wink
eh
you
fool
dont
talk
nonsense
a
lout
a
real
lout
reproaches
against
the
joking
soldier
came
from
all
sides
ramballe
was
surrounded
two
men
made
a
seat
with
their
hands
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
into
the
cottage
ramballe
put
his
arms
around
the
soldiers
necks
and
as
they
carried
him
kept
saying
pitifully
oh
mes
braves
oh
mes
bons
mes
bons
amis
voil224
des
hommes
oh
mes
braves
mes
bons
amis
and
like
a
child
he
rested
his
head
on
one
of
the
mens
shoulders
meanwhile
morel
was
sitting
in
the
best
place
surrounded
by
soldiers
morel
a
stocky
little
frenchman
with
inflamed
watery
eyes
with
a
kerchief
tied
womanlike
over
his
cap
was
dressed
in
a
womans
coat
evidently
tipsy
he
put
his
arm
around
the
soldier
sitting
next
to
him
and
sang
a
french
song
in
a
hoarse
faltering
voice
the
soldiers
held
their
sides
looking
at
him
come
on
come
on
teach
me
how
does
it
go
ill
learn
it
right
away

soldier
repeated

and
indeed
catching
the
motif
well

joyful
guffawing

they
again
offered
him
kasha
and
morel
chuckling
started
on
his
third
mess
tin
joyful
smiles
lingered
on
the
faces
of
the
young
soldiers
looking
at
morel
the
old
soldiers
who
considered
it
improper
to
be
taken
up
with
such
trifles
lay
on
the
other
side
of
the
campfire
but
getting
up
on
an
elbow
every
once
in
a
while
they
glanced
smiling
at
morel
theyre
also
people
one
of
them
said
wrapping
himself
in
his
greatcoat
even
wormwood
grows
on
its
root
ohh
lord
lord
what
an
awful
lot
of
stars
itll
be
freezing
cold
and
everything
became
still
the
stars
as
if
knowing
that
no
one
could
see
them
now
frolicked
in
the
black
sky
now
flaring
up
now
going
out
now
quivering
they
busily
whispered
among
themselves
about
something
joyful
but
mysterious
x
the
french
troops
uniformly
melted
away
in
a
mathematically
regular
progression
and
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
of
which
so
much
has
been
written
was
only
one
of
the
intermediate
steps
in
the
destruction
of
the
french
army
and
not
at
all
a
decisive
episode
of
the
campaign
if
so
much
has
been
written
and
is
being
written
about
the
berezina
that
is
so
on
the
french
side
only
because
on
the
broken
bridge
over
the
berezina
the
calamities
that
the
french
army
had
formerly
been
undergoing
regularly
here
suddenly
grouped
together
in
one
moment
and
in
one
tragic
spectacle
that
stayed
in
everyones
memory
on
the
russian
side
there
has
been
so
much
talking
and
writing
about
the
berezina
only
because
away
from
the
theater
of
the
war
in
petersburg
a
plan
was
drawn
up
by
the
same
pfuel
for
catching
napoleon
in
a
strategic
trap
on
the
river
berezina
everyone
was
confident
that
in
reality
everything
would
be
done
exactly
as
in
the
plan
and
therefore
insisted
that
it
was
precisely
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
that
destroyed
the
french
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
results
of
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
were
far
less
destructive
for
the
french
in
losses
of
ordnance
and
prisoners
than
krasnoe
as
the
numbers
show
the
sole
significance
of
the
crossing
of
the
berezina
lies
in
the
fact
that
this
crossing
proved
obviously
and
unquestionably
the
fallacy
of
all
the
plans
for
cutting
off
and
the
correctness
of
the
sole
possible
course
of
action
demanded
by
kutuzov
and
the
entire
mass
of
troopsof
merely
following
the
enemy
the
crowd
of
the
french
was
running
at
a
constantly
increasing
force
of
speed
with
all
its
energy
directed
at
achieving
its
goal
it
ran
like
a
wounded
animal
and
it
was
impossible
to
stand
in
its
way
this
was
proved
not
so
much
by
the
arrangement
of
the
crossing
as
by
the
movement
on
the
bridges
when
the
bridges
were
broken
down
the
unarmed
soldiers
the
moscow
inhabitants
the
women
with
children
who
were
in
the
french
transporteveryone
borne
on
by
the
force
of
inertia
did
not
surrender
but
ran
ahead
into
the
boats
into
the
freezing
water
that
impulse
was
reasonable
the
position
of
both
fleers
and
pursuers
was
equally
bad
remaining
with
their
own
each
of
them
in
his
distress
hoped
for
help
from
his
comrades
hoped
to
occupy
a
definite
place
among
his
own
surrendering
to
the
russians
he
would
be
in
the
same
situation
of
distress
but
would
stand
on
a
lower
step
in
sharing
the
satisfaction
of
the
necessities
of
life
the
french
did
not
need
to
have
correct
information
about
the
fact
that
half
the
prisoners
whom
no
one
knew
what
to
do
with
perished
of
cold
and
hunger
despite
all
the
desire
of
the
russians
to
save
them
they
sensed
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
most
compassionate
russian
commanders
and
lovers
of
the
french
even
the
french
in
russian
service
could
do
nothing
for
the
prisoners
the
french
perished
from
the
distress
in
which
the
russian
army
found
itself
it
was
impossible
to
take
bread
and
clothing
from
hungry
and
muchneeded
soldiers
in
order
to
give
it
to
the
not
harmful
not
hated
not
guilty
but
simply
unneeded
french
some
did
so
but
that
was
only
an
exception
behind
lay
certain
destruction
ahead
lay
hope
the
boats
were
burned
there
was
no
other
salvation
except
joint
flight
and
all
the
forces
of
the
french
were
directed
at
that
joint
flight
the
further
the
french
fled
the
more
pathetic
their
remnants
especially
after
the
berezina
in
which
owing
to
the
petersburg
plan
special
hopes
were
placed
the
more
strongly
burned
the
passions
of
the
russian
commanders
as
they
accused
each
other
and
especially
kutuzov
supposing
that
the
failure
of
the
petersburg
plan
for
the
berezina
would
be
attributed
to
him
they
expressed
their
dissatisfaction
with
him
their
contempt
for
him
and
mockery
of
him
more
and
more
strongly
the
mockery
and
contempt
it
goes
without
saying
were
expressed
in
respectful
form
in
such
form
that
kutuzov
could
not
even
ask
what
he
was
being
accused
of
and
why
they
did
not
speak
seriously
with
him
reporting
to
him
or
asking
his
permission
they
had
the
air
of
fulfilling
a
mournful
ritual
but
behind
his
back
they
winked
and
tried
to
deceive
him
at
every
step
all
these
people
precisely
because
they
could
not
understand
him
were
convinced
that
there
was
no
point
in
talking
with
the
old
man
that
he
would
never
understand
all
the
profundity
of
their
plans
that
he
would
reply
to
them
with
his
phrases
they
thought
they
were
only
phrases
about
a
golden
bridge
about
the
impossibility
of
crossing
the
border
with
a
crowd
of
vagrants
and
so
on
they
had
already
heard
all
that
from
him
and
all
that
he
saidfor
instance
that
they
should
wait
for
provisions
that
the
men
had
no
bootsall
that
was
so
simple
while
all
that
they
proposed
was
so
complex
and
clever
that
it
was
obvious
to
them
that
he
was
old
and
stupid
and
they
though
not
in
authority
were
commanders
of
genius
especially
after
the
union
with
the
army
of
the
brilliant
admiral
and
petersburg
hero
wittgenstein
this
mood
and
the
staff
gossip
reached
the
highest
limit
kutuzov
saw
it
and
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
sigh
only
once
after
the
berezina
did
he
get
angry
and
write
to
bennigsen
who
reported
separately
to
the
sovereign
the
following
letter
by
reason
of
your
bouts
of
illness
be
so
good
your
excellency
upon
receipt
of
this
present
to
go
to
kaluga
and
wait
there
for
further
commands
and
appointments
from
his
imperial
majesty
but
following
the
sending
away
of
bennigsen
the
grand
duke
konstantin
pavlovich
came
to
the
army
he
had
participated
in
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
and
had
been
removed
by
kutuzov
now
the
grand
duke
having
come
to
the
army
informed
kutuzov
of
the
displeasure
of
the
sovereign
emperor
at
the
poor
success
of
our
troops
and
the
slowness
of
their
movement
the
sovereign
emperor
intended
to
come
to
the
army
himself
any
day
the
old
man
as
experienced
in
court
affairs
as
in
military
the
same
kutuzov
who
in
august
of
that
year
had
been
chosen
commander
in
chief
against
the
will
of
the
sovereign
the
same
one
who
had
removed
the
heir
and
grand
duke
from
the
army
who
on
his
own
authority
in
opposition
to
the
sovereigns
will
had
decreed
the
abandoning
of
moscow
that
kutuzov
now
understood
at
once
that
his
time
was
up
that
his
role
had
been
played
and
that
he
no
longer
had
that
imaginary
authority
of
his
he
understood
it
not
only
by
the
attitude
of
the
court
on
the
one
hand
he
saw
that
the
military
business
in
which
he
had
played
his
role
was
finished
and
he
felt
that
his
mission
was
fulfilled
on
the
other
hand
he
began
at
the
same
time
to
feel
physical
weariness
in
his
old
body
and
the
necessity
of
physical
repose
on
the
twentyninth
of
november
kutuzov
rode
into
vilnointo
his
good
old
vilno
as
he
used
to
say
twice
during
his
service
kutuzov
had
been
governor
of
vilno
in
wealthy
unscathed
vilno
a
the
comforts
of
life
he
had
been
deprived
of
for
so
long
kutuzov
found
old
friends
and
memories
and
suddenly
turning
away
from
all
military
and
state
cares
he
immersed
himself
in
the
regular
habitual
life
insofar
as
he
was
left
in
peace
by
the
passions
that
boiled
around
him
as
if
all
that
was
being
accomplished
now
and
had
yet
to
be
accomplished
in
the
historical
world
did
not
concern
him
in
the
least
chichagov
one
of
the
most
passionate
cuttersoff
and
overrunners
chichagov
who
at
first
had
wanted
to
make
a
diversion
to
greece
and
then
to
warsaw
but
had
in
no
way
wanted
to
go
where
he
was
ordered
chichagov
known
for
his
boldness
of
speech
with
the
sovereign
chichagov
who
considered
himself
kutuzovs
benefactor
because
when
he
was
sent
in
the
year
eleven
to
conclude
a
peace
with
the
turks
over
kutuzovs
head
and
found
out
that
peace
had
already
been
concluded
he
acknowledged
before
the
sovereign
that
the
merit
of
having
concluded
the
peace
belonged
to
kutuzovthis
same
chichagov
was
the
first
to
meet
kutuzov
in
vilno
at
the
castle
where
kutuzov
was
to
stay
chichagov
in
a
naval
undress
uniform
with
a
dagger
holding
his
peaked
cap
under
his
arm
handed
kutuzov
a
formal
report
and
the
keys
to
the
city
that
contemptuously
respectful
attitude
towards
the
senile
old
man
expressed
itself
in
the
highest
degree
in
the
whole
manner
of
chichagov
who
already
knew
the
accusations
made
against
kutuzov
while
talking
with
chichagov
kutuzov
told
him
by
the
way
that
the
carriages
with
sets
of
dishes
captured
from
him
in
borisov
were
safe
and
would
be
returned
to
him

chichagov
said
flushing
with
each
of
his
words
wishing
to
prove
his
rightness
and
therefore
supposing
that
kutuzov
was
concerned
with
the
same
thing
kutuzov
smiled
his
subtle
perceptive
smile
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
replied
ce
nest
que
pour
vous
dire
ce
que
je
dis
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
sovereign
kutuzov
stationed
the
greater
the
troops
in
vilno
kutuzov
as
those
around
him
said
went
extraordinarily
to
seed
and
became
weaker
physically
during
this
stay
in
vilno
he
was
reluctant
to
occupy
himself
with
army
matters
leaving
everything
to
his
generals
and
awaiting
the
sovereign
gave
himself
up
to
a
dissipated
life
leaving
petersburg
on
the
seventh
of
december
with
his
suitecount
tolstoy
prince
volkonsky
arakcheev
and
othersthe
sovereign
arrived
in
vilno
on
the
eleventh
of
december
and
drove
straight
to
the
castle
in
his
traveling
sleigh
at
the
castle
despite
the
severe
frost
stood
several
hundred
generals
and
staff
officers
in
full
dress
uniform
and
the
honor
guard
of
the
semyonovsky
regiment
a
courier
galloping
up
to
the
castle
with
a
sweating
troika
ahead
of
the
sovereign
shouted
hes
coming
konovnitsyn
rushed
to
the
front
hall
to
report
to
kutuzov
who
was
waiting
in
the
porters
little
lodge
a
minute
later
the
old
mans
large
fat
figure
in
full
dress
uniform
with
all
his
regalia
covering
his
chest
and
a
sash
tied
tightly
around
his
belly
came
waddling
out
to
the
porch
kutuzov
put
on
his
service
cap
took
his
gloves
in
his
hand
and
negotiating
the
steps
with
difficulty
went
sideways
down
the
stairs
and
took
in
his
hand
the
report
prepared
for
presentation
to
the
sovereign
scurrying
about
whispers
another
troika
desperately
flying
by
and
all
eyes
turned
to
the
jolting
sleigh
in
which
the
figures
of
the
sovereign
and
volkonsky
could
already
be
seen
from
a
habit
of
fifty
years
all
this
had
a
physically
agitating
effect
on
the
old
general
he
patted
himself
all
over
with
anxious
haste
straightened
his
cap
and
just
as
the
sovereign
stepping
out
of
the
sleigh
raised
his
eyes
to
him
he
at
once
braced
himself
stood
to
attention
handed
over
the
report
and
began
speaking
in
his
measured
ingratiating
voice
the
sovereign
looked
kutuzov
up
and
down
with
a
quick
glance
frowned
momentarily
but
then
getting
the
better
of
himself
at
once
went
up
and
spreading
his
arms
embraced
the
old
general
again
from
an
old
habitual
impression
and
in
relation
to
his
innermost
thoughts
this
embrace
as
usual
affected
kutuzov
he
sobbed
the
sovereign
greeted
the
officers
the
semyonovsky
guard
and
shaking
the
old
mans
hand
once
more
went
with
him
into
the
castle
left
alone
with
the
field
marshal
the
sovereign
voiced
to
him
his
displeasure
with
the
slowness
of
the
pursuit
with
the
mistakes
at
krasnoe
and
the
berezina
and
informed
him
of
his
considerations
about
the
future
campaign
abroad
kutuzov
made
no
objections
or
comments
the
same
submissive
and
vacant
expression
with
which
seven
years
earlier
he
had
listened
to
the
sovereigns
orders
on
the
field
at
austerlitz
now
settled
on
his
face
when
kutuzov
came
out
of
the
study
and
with
his
heavy
dipping
gait
lowering
his
head
went
through
the
reception
room
someones
voice
stopped
him
your
serenity
someone
said
kutuzov
raised
his
head
and
looked
for
a
long
time
into
the
eyes
of
count
tolstoy
who
stood
before
him
with
some
small
object
on
a
silver
salver
kutuzov
seemed
not
to
understand
what
was
wanted
of
him
suddenly
it
was
as
if
he
remembered
a
barely
noticeable
smile
flashed
across
his
puffy
face
and
with
a
low
respectful
bow
he
took
the
object
that
lay
on
the
salver
it
was
the
order
of
st
george
first
degree
xi
the
next
day
the
field
marshal
gave
a
dinner
and
a
ball
which
the
sovereign
honored
with
his
presence
the
sovereign
had
conferred
on
kutuzov
the
order
of
st
george
first
degree
he
had
shown
him
the
highest
honors
but
the
sovereigns
displeasure
with
the
field
marshal
was
known
to
everyone
the
proprieties
were
observed
and
the
sovereign
showed
the
first
example
of
it
but
everyone
knew
that
the
old
man
was
at
fault
and
good
for
nothing
when
at
the
ball
by
the
old
habit
of
a
courtier
of
catherines
time
kutuzov
on
the
sovereigns
entrance
into
the
ballroom
ordered
the
captured
standards
thrown
down
at
his
feet
the
sovereign
winced
unpleasantly
and
spoke
some
words
among
which
some
heard
old
comedian
the
sovereigns
displeasure
with
kutuzov
increased
in
vilno
particularly
because
kutuzov
obviously
would
not
or
could
not
understand
the
significance
of
the
coming
campaign
when
the
sovereign
said
the
next
morning
to
the
officers
gathered
around
him
you
have
not
only
saved
russia
you
have
saved
europethey
all
understood
that
the
war
was
not
yet
over
kutuzov
alone
would
not
understand
that
and
openly
voiced
his
opinion
that
a
new
war
could
not
improve
the
situation
and
increase
the
glory
of
russia
but
could
only
worsen
its
position
and
diminish
the
highest
degree
of
glory
at
which
in
his
opinion
russia
now
stood
he
tried
to
demonstrate
to
the
sovereign
the
impossibility
of
recruiting
new
troops
spoke
of
the
hard
conditions
of
the
population
the
possibility
of
failure
and
so
on
given
such
a
state
of
mind
the
field
marshal
naturally
seemed
only
a
hindrance
and
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
coming
war
to
avoid
confrontations
with
the
old
man
a
way
out
was
found
of
itself
which
consisted
as
at
austerlitz
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
under
barclay
in
removing
the
ground
of
authority
he
stood
on
from
under
the
commander
in
chief
without
disturbing
him
or
informing
him
of
it
and
transferring
it
to
the
sovereign
himself
to
this
end
the
staff
was
gradually
reorganized
and
all
the
essential
authority
of
kutuzovs
staff
was
cancelled
and
transferred
to
the
sovereign
toll
konovnitsyn
and
ermolov
received
other
assignments
everyone
said
aloud
that
the
field
marshal
had
grown
very
weak
and
his
health
was
failing
he
had
to
be
in
weak
health
in
order
to
give
up
his
place
and
have
someone
else
take
over
for
him
and
indeed
his
health
was
weak
as
naturally
and
simply
and
gradually
as
kutuzov
had
come
from
turkey
to
the
treasury
in
petersburg
to
raise
a
militia
and
then
to
the
army
precisely
when
he
was
needed
so
now
just
as
naturally
gradually
and
simply
when
kutuzovs
role
had
been
played
there
appeared
in
his
place
the
new
leader
required
the
war
of
1812
besides
its
national
significance
dear
to
the
russian
heart
was
to
have
anotherthis
time
european
the
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
east
was
to
be
followed
by
a
movement
of
peoples
from
east
to
west
and
for
this
new
war
a
new
leader
was
needed
who
had
qualities
and
views
different
from
kutuzovs
and
was
moved
by
different
incentives
alexander
i
was
as
necessary
for
the
movement
of
peoples
from
east
to
west
and
for
the
restoration
of
national
frontiers
as
kutuzov
had
been
necessary
for
the
salvation
and
glory
of
russia
kutuzov
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
europe
balance
napoleon
he
could
not
understand
it
once
the
foe
was
annihilated
once
russia
was
delivered
and
placed
at
the
highest
degree
of
her
glory
for
this
russian
man
as
a
russian
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
for
the
representative
of
the
national
war
there
was
nothing
left
but
death
and
so
he
died
xii
pierre
as
most
often
happens
felt
the
whole
burden
of
the
physical
privations
and
strains
he
experienced
during
captivity
only
when
those
strains
and
privations
were
over
after
being
freed
from
captivity
he
arrived
in
orel
and
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
as
he
was
about
to
go
to
kiev
he
fell
ill
and
spent
three
months
lying
ill
in
orel
he
had
as
the
doctors
put
it
bilious
fever
though
the
doctors
treated
him
let
his
blood
and
gave
him
medications
to
drink
he
nevertheless
recovered
all
that
happened
to
pierre
from
the
time
he
was
set
free
until
his
illness
left
almost
no
impression
on
him
he
remembered
only
gray
gloomy
now
rainy
now
snowy
weather
inner
physical
anguish
pain
in
his
legs
in
his
side
remembered
the
general
impression
of
peoples
misfortunes
and
sufferings
remembered
the
disturbing
curiosity
of
officers
and
generals
who
asked
him
questions
his
trouble
finding
a
carriage
and
horses
and
above
all
remembered
his
inability
to
think
and
feel
at
that
time
on
the
day
he
was
set
free
he
saw
the
corpse
of
petya
rostov
on
the
same
day
he
learned
that
prince
andrei
had
lived
for
over
a
month
after
the
battle
of
borodino
and
had
died
only
recently
in
yaroslavl
in
the
rostovs
house
and
on
the
same
day
denisov
who
told
this
news
to
pierre
mentioned
h233l232nes
death
supposing
that
pierre
had
already
long
known
of
it
all
this
only
seemed
strange
then
to
pierre
he
felt
that
he
could
not
understand
the
meaning
of
all
this
news
he
only
made
haste
then
to
get
away
quickly
quickly
from
those
places
where
people
were
killing
each
other
to
some
quiet
haven
and
there
to
recover
to
rest
to
rethink
all
these
strange
and
new
things
that
he
learned
during
that
time
but
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
orel
he
fell
ill
on
awakening
from
his
illness
pierre
saw
himself
surrounded
by
his
two
servants
from
moscow
terenty
and
vaska
and
the
eldest
princess
who
lived
on
pierres
estate
in
yelets
and
having
learned
of
his
liberation
and
illness
came
to
look
after
him
during
his
convalescence
pierre
only
gradually
fell
out
of
the
habit
of
the
impressions
he
had
grown
used
to
over
the
past
months
and
became
used
to
the
fact
that
no
one
was
going
to
herd
him
anywhere
tomorrow
that
no
one
was
going
to
take
away
his
warm
bed
and
that
he
was
certain
to
have
dinner
and
tea
and
supper
but
for
a
long
time
in
his
dreams
he
still
saw
himself
in
the
old
conditions
of
captivity
in
the
same
way
pierre
gradually
came
to
understand
the
news
he
had
learned
after
being
freed
from
captivity
the
death
of
prince
andrei
the
death
of
his
wife
and
the
annihilation
of
the
french
the
joyful
feeling
of
freedomthat
full
inalienable
freedom
proper
to
a
human
being
the
awareness
of
which
he
had
experienced
for
the
first
time
at
the
first
halt
after
leaving
moscowfilled
pierres
soul
during
his
convalescence
he
was
astonished
at
how
this
inner
freedom
independent
of
external
circumstances
was
now
as
if
surrounded
by
the
superfluity
the
luxury
of
external
freedom
as
well
he
was
alone
in
a
strange
town
without
acquaintances
no
one
demanded
anything
of
him
no
one
sent
him
anywhere
he
had
everything
he
wanted
the
thought
of
his
wife
which
had
eternally
tormented
him
before
was
no
longer
there
because
she
was
no
longer
there
ah
how
good
how
nice
he
said
to
himself
when
they
moved
a
laid
table
up
to
him
with
clean
linen
and
fragrant
broth
or
when
in
the
evening
he
lay
down
on
the
soft
clean
bed
or
when
he
remembered
that
his
wife
and
the
french
were
no
more
ah
how
good
how
nice
and
by
old
habit
he
asked
himself
well
and
what
then
what
am
i
going
to
do
and
he
answered
himself
at
once
nothing
ill
live
ah
how
nice
that
which
he
had
been
tormented
by
before
which
he
had
constantly
sought
the
purpose
of
lifenow
did
not
exist
for
him
it
was
not
that
this
soughtfor
purpose
of
life
happened
not
to
exist
for
him
only
at
the
present
moment
but
he
felt
that
it
did
not
and
could
not
exist
and
this
very
absence
of
purpose
gave
him
that
full
joyful
awareness
of
freedom
which
at
that
time
constituted
his
happiness
he
could
have
no
purpose
because
he
now
had
faithnot
faith
in
some
rules
or
words
or
thoughts
but
faith
in
a
living
eversensed
god
before
he
had
sought
for
him
in
the
purposes
he
set
for
himself
this
seeking
for
a
purpose
had
only
been
a
seeking
for
god
and
suddenly
he
had
learned
in
his
captivity
not
through
words
not
through
arguments
but
through
immediate
sensation
what
his
nanny
had
told
him
long
ago
that
god
is
here
right
here
everywhere
in
captivity
he
had
learned
that
god
in
karataev
was
much
greater
more
infinite
and
unfathomable
than
in
the
arkhitekton
of
the
universe
recognized
by
the
masons
he
experienced
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
has
found
what
he
was
seeking
under
his
own
feet
while
he
had
been
straining
his
eyes
looking
far
away
from
himself
all
his
life
he
had
looked
off
somewhere
over
the
heads
of
the
people
around
him
yet
there
was
no
need
to
strain
his
eyes
but
only
to
look
right
in
front
of
him
formerly
he
had
been
unable
to
see
the
great
the
unfathomable
and
infinite
in
anything
he
had
only
sensed
that
it
must
be
somewhere
and
had
sought
for
it
in
all
that
was
close
and
comprehensible
he
had
seen
only
the
limited
the
petty
the
humdrum
the
meaningless
he
had
armed
himself
with
a
mental
spyglass
and
gazed
into
the
distance
where
the
petty
and
humdrum
disappearing
in
the
distant
mist
had
seemed
to
him
great
and
infinite
only
because
it
was
not
clearly
visible
thus
he
had
looked
at
european
life
politics
masonry
philosophy
philanthropy
but
even
then
in
moments
he
regarded
as
his
own
weakness
his
mind
had
penetrated
this
distance
and
there
too
he
had
seen
the
petty
the
humdrum
the
meaningless
now
he
had
learned
to
see
the
great
the
eternal
and
the
infinite
in
everything
and
therefore
in
order
to
see
it
to
enjoy
contemplating
it
he
had
naturally
abandoned
the
spyglass
he
had
been
looking
through
until
then
over
peoples
heads
and
joyfully
contemplated
the
everchanging
evergreat
unfathomable
and
infinite
life
around
him
and
the
closer
he
looked
the
calmer
and
happier
he
became
the
terrible
question
why
which
formerly
had
destroyed
all
his
mental
constructions
did
not
exist
for
him
now
now
to
this
question
why
a
simple
answer
was
always
ready
in
his
soul
because
there
is
god
that
god
without
whose
will
not
a
single
hair
falls
from
a
mans
head
xiii
pierre
was
almost
unchanged
in
his
external
ways
to
look
at
he
was
exactly
the
same
as
he
had
been
before
he
was
as
absentminded
as
before
and
seemed
to
be
taken
up
not
with
what
was
in
front
of
his
eyes
but
with
something
special
of
his
own
the
difference
between
his
former
and
present
states
consisted
in
the
fact
that
formerly
when
he
forgot
what
was
in
front
of
him
or
what
was
being
said
to
him
he
would
wrinkle
his
brow
with
suffering
as
if
trying
but
unable
to
make
out
something
far
away
now
he
forgot
what
was
being
said
to
him
and
what
was
before
him
in
the
same
way
but
now
with
a
barely
perceptible
as
if
mocking
smile
he
peered
at
what
was
in
front
of
him
and
listened
intently
to
what
was
being
said
to
him
though
he
obviously
saw
and
heard
something
quite
different
formerly
he
had
seemed
a
kind
but
unhappy
man
and
therefore
people
had
involuntarily
shunned
him
now
a
smile
of
the
joy
of
life
constantly
played
about
his
lips
and
in
his
eyes
shone
a
sympathy
for
peoplethe
question
are
they
as
content
as
i
am
and
people
enjoyed
being
in
his
presence
formerly
he
had
talked
a
great
deal
had
become
excited
as
he
talked
and
had
listened
little
now
he
was
rarely
carried
away
by
a
conversation
and
was
able
to
listen
so
well
that
people
willingly
told
him
their
innermost
secrets
the
princess
who
had
never
had
any
love
for
pierre
and
had
experienced
an
especially
hostile
feeling
towards
him
because
ever
since
the
old
counts
death
she
had
felt
herself
obliged
to
him
to
her
vexation
and
surprise
after
her
brief
stay
in
orel
where
she
had
come
with
the
intention
of
proving
to
pierre
that
despite
his
ingratitude
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
look
after
him
the
princess
soon
felt
that
she
loved
him
pierre
in
no
way
sought
the
princesss
favor
he
merely
studied
her
with
curiosity
formerly
the
princess
had
felt
indifference
and
mockery
in
his
gaze
and
she
had
shrunk
from
him
as
she
did
from
others
and
had
exhibited
only
the
combative
side
of
her
life
now
on
the
contrary
she
felt
as
if
he
was
trying
to
delve
into
the
innermost
sides
of
her
life
and
first
with
mistrust
then
with
gratitude
she
revealed
to
him
the
hidden
good
sides
of
her
character
the
most
cunning
person
could
not
have
wormed
himself
into
the
princesss
confidence
more
skillfully
calling
up
memories
in
her
of
the
better
time
of
her
youth
and
showing
sympathy
for
them
and
yet
pierres
whole
cunning
consisted
in
his
seeking
his
own
pleasure
in
calling
up
human
feelings
in
the
embittered
dry
and
in
her
own
way
proud
princess
yes
hes
a
very
very
kind
man
when
hes
under
the
influence
not
of
bad
people
but
of
such
people
as
i
the
princess
said
to
herself
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
pierre
was
also
noticed
in
their
own
way
by
his
servants
terenty
and
vaska
they
found
that
he
had
become
much
simpler
often
terenty
having
undressed
his
master
with
his
boots
and
clothes
in
his
hands
having
wished
him
a
good
night
was
slow
to
leave
waiting
for
his
master
to
get
into
conversation
and
most
often
pierre
would
stop
terenty
noticing
that
he
wanted
to
talk
well
so
tell
mehow
did
you
get
food
for
yourself
he
would
ask
and
terenty
would
begin
a
story
about
the
devastation
of
moscow
about
the
late
count
and
would
stand
for
a
long
time
holding
the
clothes
talking
and
sometimes
listening
to
pierres
stories
and
with
a
pleasant
awareness
of
his
closeness
to
the
master
and
of
friendliness
for
him
would
go
to
the
front
hall
the
doctor
who
treated
pierre
and
visited
him
every
day
though
as
all
doctors
feel
they
must
do
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
have
the
look
of
a
man
whose
every
moment
is
precious
to
suffering
mankind
sat
for
hours
with
pierre
telling
his
favorite
stories
and
observations
on
the
ways
of
the
sick
in
general
and
of
ladies
in
particular
yes
its
pleasant
to
talk
with
such
a
man
not
like
what
we
have
here
in
our
province
he
said
several
captured
officers
of
the
french
army
were
living
in
orel
and
the
doctor
brought
one
of
them
along
a
young
italian
officer
this
officer
started
visiting
pierre
and
the
princess
laughed
at
the
tender
feelings
the
italian
expressed
for
him
the
italian
was
evidently
happy
only
when
he
could
come
to
pierre
and
talk
and
tell
him
of
his
past
and
his
life
at
home
of
his
love
and
pour
out
to
him
his
indignation
against
the
french
and
especially
against
napoleon
if
all
russians
are
at
least
a
little
like
you
he
said
to
pierre
cest
un
sacril232ge
que
de
faire
la
guerre
224
un
peuple
comme
le
v244tre
you
who
have
suffered
so
much
from
the
french
you
dont
even
have
any
anger
against
them
and
pierre
had
earned
the
italians
passionate
love
only
by
calling
up
the
best
sides
of
his
soul
and
admiring
them
at
the
end
of
pierres
stay
in
orel
his
old
acquaintance
the
mason
count
willarski
came
to
visit
him
the
one
who
had
introduced
him
into
the
lodge
in
1807
willarski
was
married
to
a
rich
russian
woman
who
had
large
estates
in
orel
province
and
he
occupied
a
temporary
position
in
that
town
in
the
provision
sector
learning
that
bezukhov
was
in
orel
willarski
though
he
had
never
been
closely
acquainted
with
him
came
to
him
with
declarations
of
friendship
and
intimacy
such
as
people
usually
express
to
each
other
when
they
meet
in
the
desert
willarski
was
bored
in
orel
and
was
happy
to
meet
a
man
of
his
circle
and
as
he
supposed
with
similar
interests
but
to
his
surprise
willarski
soon
noticed
that
pierre
lagged
very
far
behind
real
life
and
had
fallen
as
he
defined
pierre
to
himself
into
apathy
and
egoism
vous
vous
encro251tez
mon
cher
he
said
to
him
despite
that
willarski
found
it
more
pleasant
to
be
with
pierre
now
than
formerly
and
he
called
on
him
every
day
but
for
pierre
looking
at
willarski
and
listening
to
him
now
it
was
strange
and
incredible
to
think
that
he
himself
had
very
recently
been
the
same
willarski
was
married
a
family
man
occupied
with
the
business
of
his
wifes
estate
with
his
service
and
with
his
family
he
considered
all
these
occupations
a
hindrance
to
life
and
considered
them
all
contemptible
because
their
purpose
was
the
personal
wellbeing
of
himself
and
his
family
military
administrative
political
and
masonic
considerations
constantly
absorbed
his
attention
and
pierre
without
trying
to
change
his
view
without
judging
him
with
his
now
constant
quiet
joyful
mockery
admired
this
strange
phenomenon
he
knew
so
well
in
his
relations
with
willarski
with
the
princess
with
the
doctor
with
all
the
people
he
met
now
there
was
a
new
feature
in
pierre
which
won
him
the
favor
of
all
people
this
was
the
recognition
of
the
possibility
for
each
person
of
thinking
feeling
and
looking
at
things
in
his
own
way
the
recognition
of
the
impossibility
of
changing
a
persons
opinion
with
words
this
legitimate
peculiarity
of
each
person
which
formerly
had
troubled
and
irritated
pierre
now
constituted
the
basis
of
the
sympathy
and
interest
he
took
in
people
the
difference
sometimes
the
complete
contradiction
of
peoples
views
with
his
own
life
and
among
themselves
delighted
pierre
and
evoked
an
amused
and
meek
smile
in
him
in
practical
matters
pierre
now
felt
unexpectedly
that
he
had
a
center
of
gravity
which
he
had
not
had
formerly
formerly
every
monetary
question
especially
requests
for
money
which
he
as
a
very
rich
man
was
very
often
subject
to
had
sent
him
into
hopeless
agitation
and
perplexity
should
i
give
it
or
not
he
would
ask
himself
i
have
it
and
he
needs
it
but
the
other
one
needs
it
more
who
needs
it
more
and
maybe
theyre
both
cheats
and
formerly
he
had
not
found
any
way
out
of
these
suppositions
and
had
given
to
everybody
as
long
as
he
had
something
to
give
he
had
formerly
found
himself
in
the
same
perplexity
faced
with
any
question
concerning
his
fortune
when
one
said
he
ought
to
act
this
way
and
another
that
way
now
to
his
surprise
he
discovered
that
there
were
no
more
doubts
and
perplexities
in
all
these
questions
in
him
an
arbiter
now
appeared
who
by
some
laws
unknown
to
him
decided
what
must
and
must
not
be
done
he
was
as
indifferent
to
monetary
matters
as
formerly
but
now
he
knew
unquestionably
what
should
be
done
and
what
should
not
the
first
application
of
this
new
arbiter
for
him
was
the
request
of
a
captive
french
colonel
who
came
to
him
told
him
a
great
deal
about
his
exploits
and
in
the
end
almost
demanded
that
pierre
give
him
four
thousand
francs
to
send
to
his
wife
and
children
without
the
slightest
difficulty
or
strain
pierre
refused
him
wondering
afterwards
at
how
simple
and
easy
what
had
formerly
seemed
insolubly
difficult
really
was
together
with
this
refusal
of
the
colonel
he
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
employ
a
ruse
so
that
on
leaving
orel
he
could
make
the
italian
officer
accept
some
money
which
he
clearly
needed
for
pierre
the
new
proof
of
his
strengthened
view
of
practical
matters
was
his
solution
of
the
question
of
his
wifes
debts
and
of
the
restoration
or
nonrestoration
of
his
houses
in
moscow
and
the
country
his
chief
steward
came
to
him
in
orel
and
together
with
him
pierre
made
a
general
accounting
of
his
changed
income
the
moscow
fire
by
his
chief
stewards
calculation
had
cost
pierre
around
two
million
by
way
of
consolation
for
these
losses
the
chief
steward
presented
pierre
with
a
calculation
showing
that
despite
these
losses
his
income
not
only
would
not
diminish
but
would
increase
if
he
refused
to
pay
the
debts
left
behind
by
the
countess
which
could
not
be
imputed
to
him
and
if
he
did
not
restore
the
houses
in
and
near
moscow
which
cost
him
eighty
thousand
a
year
and
yielded
nothing
yes
yes
thats
true
said
pierre
smiling
cheerfully
yes
yes
i
dont
need
any
of
it
my
ruin
has
made
me
much
richer
but
in
january
savelyich
came
from
moscow
told
him
about
the
situation
in
moscow
about
the
estimate
an
architect
had
given
him
for
restoring
the
houses
in
and
near
moscow
speaking
of
it
as
a
decided
thing
at
the
same
time
pierre
received
letters
from
prince
vassily
and
other
petersburg
acquaintances
the
letters
spoke
of
his
wifes
debts
and
pierre
decided
that
his
stewards
plan
which
he
had
liked
so
much
was
wrong
and
that
he
had
to
go
to
petersburg
to
settle
his
wifes
affairs
and
had
to
rebuild
in
moscow
why
it
had
to
be
so
he
did
not
know
but
he
knew
unquestionably
that
it
had
to
be
as
a
result
of
this
decision
his
income
would
be
diminished
by
three
quarters
but
it
had
to
be
so
he
felt
it
willarski
was
going
to
moscow
and
they
arranged
to
go
together
all
through
his
convalescence
in
orel
pierre
had
experienced
a
feeling
of
joy
freedom
life
but
when
during
his
journey
he
found
himself
in
the
open
world
and
saw
hundreds
of
new
faces
that
feeling
increased
still
more
all
through
the
journey
he
experienced
the
joy
of
a
schoolboy
on
vacation
all
personsthe
coachman
the
stationmaster
the
muzhiks
on
the
road
or
in
the
villageseverything
had
a
new
significance
for
him
the
presence
and
observations
of
willarski
who
constantly
complained
about
the
poverty
the
backwardness
compared
to
europe
the
ignorance
of
russia
only
enhanced
pierres
joy
where
willarski
saw
deadness
pierre
saw
the
extraordinary
mighty
force
of
vitality
that
force
which
in
the
snow
over
this
vast
expanse
maintained
the
life
of
this
whole
special
and
united
people
he
did
not
contradict
willarski
and
as
if
agreeing
with
him
since
pretending
to
agree
was
the
shortest
means
of
avoiding
an
argument
that
could
not
lead
anywhere
listened
to
him
with
a
joyful
smile
xiv
just
as
it
is
hard
to
explain
why
and
where
ants
hurry
to
from
a
demolished
anthill
some
away
from
the
anthill
carrying
specks
of
dust
eggs
and
dead
bodies
and
others
back
to
the
anthillwhy
they
run
into
each
other
chase
each
other
fightso
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
the
reasons
that
made
the
russian
people
after
the
departure
of
the
french
crowd
into
the
place
which
was
formerly
called
moscow
but
just
as
when
looking
at
the
ants
scattered
around
the
destroyed
anthill
despite
its
complete
obliteration
one
can
see
by
the
tenacity
the
energy
the
countless
numbers
of
the
swarming
insects
that
everything
has
been
destroyed
except
for
something
indestructible
immaterial
which
made
for
the
whole
strength
of
the
anthillso
moscow
in
the
month
of
october
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
no
authorities
no
churches
no
holy
objects
no
wealth
no
houses
was
the
same
moscow
it
had
been
in
august
everything
was
destroyed
except
for
something
immaterial
but
mighty
and
indestructible
the
promptings
of
the
people
who
rushed
to
moscow
from
all
sides
after
it
was
cleared
of
the
foe
were
the
most
varied
personal
and
in
the
initial
period
for
the
most
part
wild
animal
promptings
only
one
prompting
was
common
to
them
allto
rush
to
the
place
that
was
formerly
called
moscow
so
as
to
apply
their
activity
there
in
a
week
there
were
already
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
in
moscow
in
twotwentyfive
thousand
and
so
on
rising
ever
higher
and
higher
this
number
by
the
fall
of
1813
had
reached
a
figure
exceeding
the
population
of
the
year
1812
the
first
russian
people
who
entered
moscow
were
the
cossacks
of
wintzingerodes
detachment
the
muzhiks
of
the
neighboring
villages
and
inhabitants
who
had
fled
and
had
been
hiding
in
the
vicinity
on
entering
devastated
moscow
and
finding
it
looted
the
russians
also
started
looting
they
went
on
with
what
the
french
had
been
doing
the
muzhiks
came
to
moscow
with
trains
of
wagons
to
take
back
to
their
villages
all
that
had
been
abandoned
in
the
devastated
moscow
houses
and
streets
the
cossacks
carried
off
as
much
as
they
could
to
their
headquarters
the
house
owners
took
everything
they
found
in
other
houses
and
transported
it
to
their
own
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
their
property
but
after
the
first
looters
came
another
wave
a
third
and
looting
in
time
with
the
increasing
number
of
looters
became
harder
and
harder
every
day
and
took
on
more
definite
forms
the
french
had
found
moscow
empty
but
with
all
the
forms
of
a
city
leading
an
organically
regular
life
with
its
various
functions
of
trade
crafts
luxury
state
government
religion
these
forms
were
lifeless
but
they
still
existed
there
were
rows
of
stalls
shops
storehouses
granaries
bazaarsmost
of
them
with
stock
there
were
factories
workshops
there
were
palaces
wealthy
houses
filled
with
luxury
objects
there
were
hospitals
jails
government
offices
churches
cathedrals
the
longer
the
french
stayed
the
more
these
forms
of
city
life
were
obliterated
and
in
the
end
it
all
merged
into
one
indistinct
lifeless
field
for
looting
the
longer
the
looting
of
the
french
went
on
the
more
it
destroyed
the
wealth
of
moscow
and
the
strength
of
the
looters
the
longer
the
looting
of
the
russians
with
which
they
began
their
takeover
of
the
capital
went
on
and
the
greater
the
number
of
people
taking
it
the
more
quickly
it
restored
the
wealth
of
moscow
and
the
regular
life
of
the
city
besides
looters

most
varied

to

by

to

out
of

to

with

beat

down

lower
than
before
teams
of
carpenters
hoping
for

entered
moscow
every

and
on

there
were

repaired
merchants
opened
their

by
the
french
the
owners
of
those
houses
in
which
many
things
had
been
brought
together
from
other
houses
complained
of
the
unfairness
of
bringing
them
all
to
the
faceted
palace
others
insisted
that
the
french
had
brought
things
together
in
one
place
from
various
houses
and
therefore
it
was
unfair
to
give
the
owner
of
the
house
the
things
found
in
it
the
police
were
abused
they
were
bribed
the
estimates
of
burneddown

property
were
inflated
tenfold
there
were
demands
for
relief
count
rastopchin
wrote
his
proclamations
xv
at
the
end
of
january
pierre
arrived
in
moscow
and
settled
in
the
surviving
wing
of
his
house
he
called
on
count
rastopchin
and
on
some
acquaintances
who
had
returned
to
moscow
and
intended
to
go
to
petersburg
in
two
days
everyone
was
celebrating
the
victory
everything
was
boiling
with
life
in
the
destroyed
and
reviving
capital
everyone
was
glad
to
have
pierre
back
everyone
wanted
to
see
him
and
everyone
asked
him
about
what
he
had
seen
pierre
felt
especially
amicably
disposed
towards
all
the
people
he
met
but
now
he
involuntarily
kept
himself
on
guard
with
all
people
so
as
not
to
bind
himself
by
anything
to
all
the
questions
put
to
him
important
or
quite
trifling
he
replied
with
equal
vagueness
to
whatever
he
was
askedwhere
was
he
going
to
live
was
he
going
to
build
when
would
he
be
going
to
petersburg
and
might
he
take
a
little
box
with
himhe
replied
yes
maybe
i
think
so
and
so
on
of
the
rostovs
he
heard
that
they
were
in
kostroma
and
the
thought
of
natasha
rarely
crossed
his
mind
if
it
did
it
was
only
as
a
pleasant
memory
of
long
ago
he
felt
not
only
free
of
the
conventions
of
life
but
also
of
that
feeling
which
he
as
it
seemed
to
him
had
deliberately
affected
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
in
moscow
he
learned
from
the
drubetskoys
that
princess
marya
was
in
moscow
the
death
the
sufferings
the
last
days
of
prince
andrei
had
often
occupied
pierre
and
now
came
to
his
mind
again
with
new
vividness
having
learned
at
dinner
that
princess
marya
was
in
moscow
and
living
in
her
unburnt
house
on
vzdvizhenka
he
went
to
see
her
that
same
evening
on
the
way
to
princess
marya
pierre
never
stopped
thinking
of
prince
andrei
of
his
friendship
with
him
of
his
various
meetings
with
him
and
especially
of
the
last
one
in
borodino
can
it
be
that
he
died
in
the
spiteful
mood
he
was
in
then
can
it
be
that
the
explanation
of
life
was
not
revealed
to
him
before
death
thought
pierre
he
remembered
about
karataev
about
his
death
and
involuntarily
started
comparing
these
two
men
so
different
and
at
the
same
time
so
similar
because
of
the
love
he
had
for
both
of
them
and
because
both
had
lived
and
both
had
died
pierre
drove
up
to
the
old
princes
house
in
the
most
serious
state
of
mind
the
house
was
intact
there
were
traces
of
damage
but
the
character
of
the
house
was
the
same
an
old
servant
who
met
pierre
with
a
stern
face
as
if
wishing
to
make
it
known
to
the
visitor
that
the
princes
absence
had
not
disturbed
the
order
of
the
house
said
that
the
princess
had
been
pleased
to
retire
to
her
rooms
and
that
she
received
on
sundays
announce
me
perhaps
shell
receive
me
said
pierre
yes
sir
said
the
servant
please
come
to
the
portrait
room
a
few
minutes
later
the
servant
and
dessales
came
out
to
pierre
dessales
told
pierre
on
the
princesss
behalf
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
see
him
and
asked
if
he
would
forgive
her
lack
of
ceremony
that
he
come
to
her
rooms
upstairs
in
a
room
with
a
low
ceiling
lit
by
one
candle
sat
the
princess
and
with
her
someone
else
in
a
black
dress
pierre
recalled
that
the
princess
always
had
lady
companions
but
who
and
what
sort
these
companions
were
pierre
did
not
know
and
did
not
recall
its
one
of
her
companions
he
thought
glancing
at
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
the
princess
rose
quickly
to
meet
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
yes
she
said
looking
intently
into
his
changed
face
after
he
had
kissed
her
hand
so
this
is
how
you
and
i
meet
during
the
last
days
he
often
spoke
of
you
she
said
shifting
her
gaze
from
pierre
to
the
companion
with
a
shyness
that
struck
him
for
a
moment
i
was
so
glad
to
learn
that
you
had
been
saved
it
was
the
only
joyful
news
we
had
received
for
a
long
time
again
still
more
uneasily
the
princess
glanced
at
her
companion
and
was
about
to
say
something
but
pierre
interrupted
her
can
you
imagine
i
knew
nothing
about
him
he
said
i
counted
him
as
killed
all
i
knew
i
knew
from
other
people
at
third
hand
i
know
only
that
he
ended
up
with
the
rostovswhat
a
fate
pierre
was
speaking
quickly
animatedly
he
glanced
once
at
the
face
of
the
companion
saw
an
attentively
tender
curious
gaze
directed
at
him
and
as
often
happens
during
a
conversation
felt
for
some
reason
that
this
companion
in
the
black
dress
was
a
sweet
kind
nice
being
who
would
not
hinder
his
hearttoheart
talk
with
princess
marya
but
when
he
said
the
last
words
about
the
rostovs
the
perplexity
on
princess
maryas
face
showed
still
more
strongly
she
again
shifted
her
gaze
from
pierres
face
to
the
face
of
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
said
dont
you
recognize
her
pierre
glanced
once
more
at
the
pale
fine
face
of
the
companion
with
its
dark
eyes
and
strange
mouth
something
dear
long
forgotten
and
more
than
sweet
looked
at
him
from
those
attentive
eyes
but
no
it
cant
be
he
thought
this
stern
thin
pale
aged
face
it
cant
be
her
its
only
a
reminiscence
of
that
one
but
just
then
princess
marya
said
natasha
and
the
face
with
its
attentive
eyes
with
difficulty
with
effort
like
a
rusty
door
openingsmiled
and
from
that
open
door
there
suddenly
breathed
and
poured
out
upon
pierre
that
longforgotten
happiness
of
which
especially
now
he
was
not
even
thinking
it
breathed
out
enveloped
and
swallowed
him
whole
when
she
smiled
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
it
was
natasha
and
he
loved
her
in
that
first
moment
pierre
involuntarily
told
her
and
princess
marya
and
above
all
himself
a
secret
he
himself
was
unaware
of
he
blushed
joyfully
and
painfully
he
wanted
to
conceal
his
excitement
but
the
more
he
wanted
to
conceal
it
the
more
clearlymore
clearly
than
the
most
definite
wordshe
said
to
himself
and
to
her
and
to
princess
marya
that
he
loved
her
no
its
just
because
of
the
unexpectedness
thought
pierre
but
as
he
was
about
to
continue
the
conversation
he
had
started
with
princess
marya
he
again
glanced
at
natasha
and
he
blushed
still
more
deeply
and
a
still
greater
excitement
of
joy
and
fear
seized
his
soul
he
became
entangled
in
his
words
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
speech
pierre
had
not
noticed
natasha
because
he
had
never
expected
to
see
her
there
but
he
had
not
recognized
her
because
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
since
he
had
last
seen
her
was
enormous
she
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
but
that
was
not
what
had
made
her
unrecognizable
it
had
been
impossible
to
recognize
her
in
the
first
moment
as
he
came
in
because
on
that
face
in
the
eyes
of
which
formerly
there
had
always
shone
a
secret
smile
of
the
joy
of
life
now
when
he
had
come
in
and
glanced
at
her
for
the
first
time
there
had
been
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
smile
there
had
been
only
eyesattentive
kind
and
sadly
questioning
pierres
confusion
was
not
reflected
as
confusion
in
natasha
but
only
as
a
pleasure
that
almost
imperceptibly
lit
up
her
whole
face
xvi
shes
come
to
stay
with
me
said
princess
marya
the
count
and
countess
will
come
any
day
now
the
countess
is
in
a
terrible
state
but
natasha
herself
needed
to
see
a
doctor
they
forced
her
to
come
with
me
yes
is
there
a
family
without
its
grief
said
pierre
turning
to
natasha
you
know
it
was
on
the
same
day
that
we
were
set
free
i
saw
him
he
was
such
a
lovely
boy
natasha
was
looking
at
him
and
in
reply
to
his
words
her
eyes
only
widened
and
lit
up
the
more
what
can
one
say
or
think
in
consolation
said
pierre
nothing
why
did
such
a
nice
boy
so
full
of
life
have
to
die
yes
in
our
time
it
would
be
hard
to
live
without
faith
said
princess
marya
yes
yes
thats
really
true
pierre
hastily
interrupted
why
asked
natasha
looking
attentively
into
pierres
eyes
what
do
you
mean
why
said
princess
marya
the
mere
thought
of
what
awaits
us
there
natasha
not
hearing
princess
marya
out
again
glanced
questioningly
at
pierre
its
because
pierre
went
on
only
a
person
who
believes
that
there
is
a
god
who
rules
over
us
can
endure
such
a
loss
as
hersand
yours
said
pierre
natasha
had
already
opened
her
mouth
to
say
something
but
suddenly
stopped
pierre
hastened
to
turn
away
from
her
and
again
addressed
princess
marya
with
a
question
about
the
last
days
of
his
friends
life
pierres
confusion
had
now
almost
vanished
but
along
with
that
he
felt
that
all
his
former
freedom
had
also
vanished
he
felt
that
now
over
his
every
word
his
every
deed
there
was
a
judge
a
judgment
which
was
dearer
to
him
than
the
judgments
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
he
spoke
now
and
along
with
his
words
he
considered
the
impression
his
words
would
make
on
natasha
he
did
not
deliberately
say
what
would
please
her
but
whatever
he
said
he
judged
himself
from
her
point
of
view
princess
marya
reluctantly
as
always
happens
began
to
tell
him
about
the
state
in
which
she
had
found
prince
andrei
but
pierres
questions
his
animatedly
restless
glance
his
face
trembling
with
emotion
gradually
made
her
go
into
details
which
on
her
own
she
had
been
afraid
to
renew
in
her
imagination
yes
yes
so
so
pierre
kept
saying
bending
over
princess
marya
with
his
whole
body
and
greedily
listening
to
her
story
yes
yes
so
he
calmed
down
softened
he
always
sought
one
thing
with
all
the
forces
of
his
soul
to
be
fully
good
so
that
he
could
not
be
afraid
of
death
the
shortcomings
that
were
in
himif
there
were
anydid
not
come
from
him
so
he
softened
said
pierre
what
a
happy
thing
that
he
met
you
he
said
to
natasha
suddenly
turning
to
her
and
looking
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
tears
natashas
face
twitched
she
frowned
and
momentarily
lowered
her
eyes
for
about
a
minute
she
hesitated
whether
she
should
speak
or
not
yes
it
was
happy
she
said
in
a
soft
chesty
voice
for
me
it
certainly
was
happy
she
paused
and
hehehe
said
that
he
was
wishing
for
it
at
the
same
moment
that
i
came
to
him
natashas
voice
broke
she
blushed
pressed
her
hands
to
her
knees
and
all
at
once
obviously
making
an
effort
with
herself
raised
her
head
and
began
speaking
quickly
we
knew
nothing
as
we
were
leaving
moscow
i
didnt
dare
ask
about
him
and
suddenly
sonya
told
me
he
was
with
us
i
didnt
think
anything
i
couldnt
imagine
what
state
he
was
in
i
only
needed
to
see
him
to
be
with
him
she
said
trembling
and
breathless
and
not
letting
them
interrupt
her
she
told
what
she
had
never
yet
told
anyone
all
that
she
had
lived
through
during
those
three
weeks
of
their
journey
and
life
in
yaroslavl
pierre
listened
to
her
openmouthed
not
taking
his
tearfilled
eyes
from
her
listening
to
her
he
did
not
think
of
prince
andrei
or
of
death
or
of
what
she
was
telling
he
listened
to
her
and
simply
pitied
her
for
the
suffering
she
was
experiencing
now
as
she
spoke
the
princess
wincing
from
the
desire
to
hold
back
her
tears
sat
beside
natasha
and
for
the
first
time
listened
to
the
story
of
those
last
days
of
the
love
between
her
brother
and
natasha
this
tormenting
and
joyful
story
was
evidently
necessary
for
natasha
she
spoke
mixing
the
most
trifling
details
with
her
innermost
secrets
and
it
seemed
she
could
never
finish
she
repeated
the
same
things
several
times
dessaless
voice
was
heard
outside
the
door
asking
whether
nikolushka
could
come
in
to
say
good
night
well
thats
all
thats
all
said
natasha
she
quickly
stood
up
just
as
nikolushka
was
coming
in
and
almost
ran
to
the
door
bumped
her
head
against
the
door
which
was
covered
by
a
curtain
and
with
a
moan
either
of
pain
or
of
sorrow
burst
out
of
the
room
pierre
looked
at
the
door
through
which
she
had
gone
and
could
not
understand
why
he
was
suddenly
left
all
alone
in
the
world
princess
marya
called
him
out
of
his
distraction
drawing
his
attention
to
her
nephew
who
had
come
into
the
room
nikolushkas
face
which
resembled
his
fathers
so
affected
pierre
in
that
moment
of
inner
softening
in
which
he
now
found
himself
that
having
kissed
him
he
got
up
hastily
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
went
over
to
the
window
he
wanted
to
take
leave
of
princess
marya
but
she
kept
him
no
natasha
and
i
sometimes
dont
go
to
bed
till
after
two
please
stay
ill
order
supper
served
go
downstairs
well
come
presently
before
pierre
went
out
the
princess
said
to
him
its
the
first
time
shes
spoken
of
him
like
that
xvii
pierre
was
taken
to
the
big
welllit
dining
room
a
few
minutes
later
footsteps
were
heard
and
the
princess
and
natasha
came
into
the
room
natasha
was
calm
though
a
stern
unsmiling
expression
had
again
settled
on
her
face
princess
marya
natasha
and
pierre
equally
experienced
that
feeling
of
awkwardness
that
usually
follows
the
end
of
a
serious
and
heartfelt
talk
to
go
on
with
the
previous
conversation
is
impossible
to
talk
about
trifles
is
shameful
and
to
be
silent
is
unpleasant
because
one
wants
to
talk
and
this
silence
is
like
a
pretence
they
silently
went
to
the
table
the
servants
moved
chairs
out
and
in
pierre
unfolded
the
cool
napkin
and
deciding
to
break
the
silence
glanced
at
natasha
and
princess
marya
they
had
both
obviously
just
decided
on
the
same
thing
in
the
eyes
of
both
shone
a
contentment
with
life
and
a
recognition
that
besides
sorrow
there
were
also
joys
do
you
drink
vodka
count
asked
princess
marya
and
these
words
suddenly
dispersed
the
shadows
of
the
past
tell
us
about
yourself
said
princess
marya
they
tell
such
incredible
wonders
about
you
yes
pierre
replied
with
his
now
habitual
smile
of
mild
mockery
they
even
tell
me
such
wonders
as
ive
never
seen
even
in
dreams
marya
abramovna
invited
me
to
her
house
and
told
me
everything
that
has
happened
to
me
or
should
have
happened
stepan
stepanych
also
taught
me
how
to
tell
my
story
generally
ive
noticed
that
being
an
interesting
person
is
very
convenient
im
an
interesting
person
now
people
invite
me
and
tell
me
about
myself
natasha
smiled
and
was
about
to
say
something
weve
been
told
princess
marya
interrupted
her
that
you
lost
two
million
in
moscow
is
it
true
and
ive
become
three
times
richer
said
pierre
despite
the
fact
that
his
wifes
debts
and
the
necessity
of
building
had
changed
his
affairs
he
went
on
telling
people
that
he
had
become
three
times
richer
what
ive
unquestionably
gained
is
freedom
he
began
seriously
but
he
decided
not
to
go
on
noticing
that
it
was
too
egotistical
a
subject
for
conversation
and
are
you
building
yes
savelyich
orders
me
to
tell
us
did
you
not
yet
know
of
the
countesss
death
when
you
stayed
in
moscow
princess
marya
asked
and
blushed
at
once
noticing
that
by
asking
this
question
right
after
his
words
about
being
free
she
was
ascribing
a
meaning
to
his
words
that
they
might
not
have
had
no
answered
pierre
obviously
not
finding
anything
awkward
in
the
interpretation
princess
marya
had
given
to
his
mention
of
his
freedom
i
learned
of
it
in
orel
and
you
cant
imagine
how
it
struck
me
we
were
not
exemplary
spouses
he
said
quickly
glancing
at
natasha
and
noticing
curiosity
on
her
face
about
how
he
would
speak
of
his
wife
but
this
death
struck
me
terribly
when
two
persons
quarrel
both
are
always
guilty
and
ones
guilt
suddenly
becomes
terribly
heavy
before
a
person
who
is
no
longer
there
and
then
such
a
deathwithout
friends
without
consolation
im
very
very
sorry
for
her
he
finished
and
was
pleased
to
notice
joyful
approval
on
natashas
face
yes
and
now
youre
a
bachelor
and
eligible
again
said
princess
marya
pierre
suddenly
blushed
deeply
and
tried
for
a
long
time
not
to
look
at
natasha
when
he
ventured
to
glance
at
her
her
face
was
cold
stern
and
even
contemptuous
as
it
seemed
to
him
but
did
you
really
see
and
speak
with
napoleon
as
weve
been
told
asked
princess
marya
pierre
laughed
not
once
never
it
always
seems
to
everybody
that
being
in
captivity
means
being
napoleons
guest
i
not
only
didnt
see
him
but
i
didnt
even
hear
about
him
i
was
in
much
inferior
company
the
supper
was
coming
to
an
end
and
pierre
who
at
first
refused
to
tell
about
his
captivity
was
gradually
drawn
into
the
story
but
its
true
that
you
stayed
in
order
to
kill
napoleon
natasha
asked
him
with
a
faint
smile
i
guessed
it
then
when
we
met
you
by
the
sukhareva
towerremember
pierre
acknowledged
that
it
was
true
and
starting
with
that
question
guided
gradually
by
the
questions
of
princess
marya
and
especially
natasha
was
drawn
into
a
detailed
account
of
his
adventures
at
first
he
spoke
with
that
mocking
meek
attitude
he
now
had
towards
people
and
especially
towards
himself
but
then
when
he
came
to
the
story
of
the
horrors
and
suffering
he
had
seen
he
involuntarily
got
carried
away
without
noticing
it
and
started
speaking
with
the
restrained
emotion
of
a
man
who
is
reliving
strong
impressions
in
recollection
princess
marya
with
a
meek
smile
looked
now
at
pierre
now
at
natasha
in
this
whole
story
she
saw
only
pierre
and
his
kindness
natasha
leaning
on
her
arm
the
expression
of
her
face
constantly
changing
with
the
story
followed
pierre
without
tearing
herself
away
for
a
moment
clearly
reliving
what
he
was
telling
along
with
him
not
only
her
gaze
but
her
exclamations
and
the
brief
questions
she
asked
showed
pierre
that
she
understood
precisely
what
he
meant
to
convey
in
what
he
was
telling
it
was
clear
that
she
understood
not
only
what
he
was
telling
but
also
what
he
would
have
liked
to
but
could
not
express
in
words
his
episode
with
the
child
and
the
woman
whom
he
was
imprisoned
for
defending
pierre
told
like
this
it
was
a
terrible
spectacle
children
were
abandoned
some
in
the
flamesin
my
presence
a
child
was
pulled
outwomen
had
their
things
pulled
off
them
earrings
torn
out
pierre
blushed
and
faltered
here
the
patrol
arrived
and
took
all
the
men
all
those
who
werent
looting
and
me
too
youre
surely
not
telling
us
everything
you
surely
did
something
said
natasha
and
she
paused
something
good
pierre
went
on
with
what
he
was
telling
when
he
told
about
the
execution
he
wanted
to
avoid
the
terrible
details
but
natasha
demanded
that
he
not
leave
anything
out
pierre
began
telling
about
karataev
by
then
he
had
stood
up
from
the
table
and
was
pacing
natasha
followed
him
with
her
eyes
and
stopped
no
you
cant
understand
what
i
learned
from
that
illiterate
mana
little
simpleton
no
no
go
on
said
natasha
where
is
he
he
was
killed
almost
in
my
presence
and
pierre
began
telling
about
the
last
period
of
their
retreat
karataevs
illness
his
voice
trembled
constantly
and
his
death
pierre
told
of
his
adventures
as
he
had
never
told
them
to
anyone
as
he
had
never
yet
recalled
them
to
himself
it
was
as
if
he
now
saw
a
new
significance
in
everything
he
had
lived
through
now
as
he
told
it
all
to
natasha
he
experienced
that
rare
pleasure
which
is
granted
by
women
when
they
listen
to
a
mannot
intelligent
women
who
when
they
listen
try
either
to
memorize
what
they
are
told
in
order
to
enrich
their
minds
and
on
occasion
retell
the
same
thing
or
else
to
adjust
what
is
being
told
to
themselves
and
quickly
say
something
intelligent
of
their
own
worked
out
in
their
small
intellectual
domain
but
the
pleasure
granted
by
real
women
endowed
with
the
ability
to
select
and
absorb
all
the
best
of
what
a
man
has
to
show
natasha
not
knowing
it
herself
was
all
attention
she
did
not
miss
a
word
of
pierres
not
a
waver
in
his
voice
not
a
glance
not
the
twitch
of
a
facial
muscle
not
a
gesture
she
caught
the
notyetspoken
word
in
flight
and
brought
it
straight
into
her
open
heart
guessing
the
secret
meaning
of
all
pierres
inner
work
princess
marya
understood
the
story
sympathized
with
it
but
she
now
saw
something
else
that
absorbed
all
her
attention
she
saw
the
possibility
of
love
and
happiness
between
natasha
and
pierre
and
that
thought
which
occurred
to
her
for
the
first
time
filled
her
soul
with
joy
it
was
three
oclock
in
the
morning
the
servants
came
with
sad
and
stern
faces
to
change
the
candles
but
no
one
noticed
them
pierre
finished
his
story
natasha
went
on
looking
at
him
intently
and
attentively
with
her
shining
animated
eyes
as
if
wishing
to
understand
the
rest
which
he
had
perhaps
not
expressed
pierre
in
shy
and
happy
confusion
glanced
at
her
from
time
to
time
and
tried
to
think
of
what
to
say
now
in
order
to
turn
the
conversation
to
another
subject
princess
marya
was
silent
it
occurred
to
no
one
that
it
was
three
oclock
in
the
morning
and
time
for
bed
they
say
misfortunes
sufferings
said
pierre
well
if
someone
said
to
me
right
now
this
minute
do
you
want
to
remain
the
way
you
were
before
captivity
or
live
through
it
all
over
again
for
gods
sake
captivity
again
and
horsemeat
once
were
thrown
off
our
habitual
paths
we
think
all
is
lost
but
its
only
here
that
the
new
and
the
good
begins
as
long
as
theres
life
theres
happiness
theres
much
much
still
to
come
im
saying
that
to
you
he
said
turning
to
natasha
yes
yes
she
said
responding
to
something
quite
different
i
too
would
wish
for
nothing
except
to
live
through
it
all
over
again
pierre
looked
at
her
attentively
yes
and
nothing
more
natasha
confirmed
not
true
not
true
cried
pierre
im
not
to
blame
that
im
alive
and
want
to
live
and
you
do
too
suddenly
natasha
lowered
her
head
to
her
hands
and
began
to
cry
what
is
it
natasha
asked
princess
marya
nothing
nothing
she
smiled
at
pierre
through
her
tears
goodbye
its
time
for
bed
pierre
got
up
and
took
his
leave
princess
marya
and
natasha
as
always
came
together
in
the
bedroom
they
talked
about
what
pierre
had
told
them
princess
marya
did
not
voice
her
opinion
of
pierre
natasha
also
did
not
speak
of
him
well
good
night
marie
said
natasha
you
know
im
often
afraid
that
we
dont
talk
about
him
prince
andrei
as
if
were
afraid
of
lowering
our
feeling
and
were
forgetting
princess
marya
sighed
deeply
and
by
that
sigh
acknowledged
the
correctness
of
natashas
words
but
in
words
she
did
not
agree
with
her
as
if
we
could
forget
she
said
it
felt
so
good
to
me
tonight
to
tell
it
all
hard
and
painful
and
good
very
good
said
natasha
im
sure
he
really
loved
him
thats
why
i
told
himthere
was
no
harm
in
my
telling
him
she
asked
suddenly
blushing
pierre
oh
no
hes
so
wonderful
said
princess
marya
you
know
marie
natasha
said
suddenly
with
a
mischievous
smile
which
princess
marya
had
not
seen
on
her
face
for
a
long
time
hes
become
somehow
clean
smooth
freshas
if
from
the
bathhouse
you
understandmorally
from
the
bathhouse
hasnt
he
yes
said
princess
marya
hes
gained
much
and
his
short
little
frock
coat
and
cropped
hair
just
well
just
like
from
the
bathhousepapa
used
to
i
understand
that
he
prince
andrei
loved
no
one
as
he
did
him
said
princess
marya
yes
and
hes
different
from
him
they
say
men
become
friends
when
theyre
quite
different
that
must
be
true
isnt
it
true
that
hes
not
like
him
at
all
yes
and
hes
marvelous
well
good
night
answered
natasha
and
that
same
mischievous
smile
as
if
forgotten
remained
on
her
face
for
a
long
time
xviii
pierre
could
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
time
that
night
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
now
frowning
thinking
over
something
difficult
suddenly
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
shivering
now
smiling
happily
he
was
thinking
about
prince
andrei
about
natasha
about
their
love
and
now
felt
jealous
of
her
past
now
reproached
himself
now
forgave
himself
for
it
it
was
already
six
oclock
in
the
morning
and
he
was
still
pacing
the
room
well
nothing
to
be
done
if
its
impossible
now
without
that
nothing
to
be
done
it
means
it
has
to
be
so
he
said
to
himself
and
hastily
undressing
he
went
to
bed
happy
and
excited
but
with
no
doubt
or
indecision
i
musthowever
strange
however
impossible
this
happinessi
must
do
everything
to
make
it
so
that
she
and
i
are
man
and
wife
he
said
to
himself
several
days
before
then
pierre
had
fixed
on
friday
as
the
day
of
his
departure
for
petersburg
when
he
woke
up
on
thursday
savelyich
came
to
him
for
orders
about
packing
things
for
the
trip
why
to
petersburg
whats
petersburg
whos
in
peterburg
he
asked
involuntarily
though
only
to
himself
yes
there
was
something
long
long
ago
before
this
happened
that
gave
me
a
reason
for
going
to
petersburg
he
recalled
and
why
not
maybe
ill
even
go
how
kind
and
attentive
he
is
how
he
remembers
everything
he
thought
looking
at
savelyichs
old
face
and
what
a
pleasant
smile
he
thought
so
you
still
dont
want
your
freedom
savelyich
asked
pierre
what
do
i
need
freedom
for
your
excellency
we
lived
all
right
with
the
late
count
god
rest
his
soul
and
with
you
we
havent
seen
any
offenses
well
but
your
children
the
children
will
get
along
your
excellency
one
can
live
with
such
masters
well
but
my
heirs
said
pierre
if
i
suddenly
get
marriedand
it
may
happen
he
added
with
an
involuntary
smile
and
if
i
may
be
so
bold
it
would
be
a
good
thing
your
excellency
he
takes
it
so
lightly
thought
pierre
he
doesnt
know
how
frightening
how
dangerous
it
is
too
early
or
too
latefrightening
what
are
your
orders
if
you
please
will
you
be
leaving
tomorrow
asked
savelyich
no
ill
postpone
it
a
little
ill
tell
you
later
forgive
me
for
the
trouble
said
pierre
and
looking
at
savelyichs
smile
he
thought
how
strange
though
that
he
doesnt
know
theres
no
more
petersburg
now
and
first
of
all
this
thing
must
be
resolved
however
he
surely
does
know
and
is
only
pretending
shall
i
talk
to
him
what
does
he
think
pierre
wondered
no
some
other
time
at
breakfast
pierre
told
the
princess
that
he
had
been
at
princess
maryas
yesterday
and
had
found
therecan
you
imagine
whomnatalie
rostov
the
princess
pretended
that
she
saw
nothing
more
extraordinary
in
this
news
than
if
he
had
seen
some
anna
semyonovna
do
you
know
her
asked
pierre
ive
seen
the
princess
she
replied
i
heard
they
were
matching
her
with
the
young
rostov
that
would
be
very
good
for
the
rostovs
they
say
theyre
completely
ruined
no
do
you
know
miss
rostov
i
only
heard
about
that
story
then
a
great
pity
no
she
doesnt
understand
or
shes
pretending
thought
pierre
id
better
not
say
anything
to
her
either
the
princess
was
also
preparing
provisions
for
pierres
trip
how
kind
they
all
are
thought
pierre
to
busy
themselves
with
all
this
now
when
it
certainly
cant
interest
them
anymore
and
all
for
me
thats
the
astonishing
thing
that
same
day
the
police
chief
came
to
pierre
with
an
offer
to
send
an
agent
to
the
faceted
palace
to
retrieve
things
that
were
being
distributed
to
their
owners
and
this
one
too
thought
pierre
looking
into
the
police
chiefs
face
such
a
nice
handsome
officer
and
so
kind
to
be
concerned
with
such
trifles
now
and
yet
they
say
hes
dishonest
and
profits
from
it
what
nonsense
and
anyhow
why
shouldnt
he
profit
he
was
brought
up
that
way
and
they
all
do
it
but
such
a
pleasant
kind
face
and
he
smiles
looking
at
me
pierre
went
to
dine
at
princess
maryas
driving
along
the
streets
amidst
the
charred
ruins
of
houses
he
was
astonished
at
the
beauty
of
these
ruins
the
chimney
stacks
of
the
houses
the
brokendown
walls
picturesquely
reminiscent
of
the
rhine
and
the
colosseum
were
strung
out
hiding
each
other
through
the
burnt
quarters
cabbies
and
their
passengers
carpenters
notching
frames
market
women
and
shopkeepers
all
glanced
at
pierre
with
merry
beaming
faces
and
seemed
to
be
saying
ah
here
he
is
well
see
what
comes
of
it
as
he
was
going
into
princess
maryas
house
doubt
came
over
pierre
whether
it
was
true
that
he
had
been
there
yesterday
had
seen
natasha
and
spoken
with
her
maybe
i
invented
it
maybe
ill
go
in
and
not
see
anybody
but
he
had
no
sooner
entered
the
room
than
he
sensed
her
presence
with
his
whole
being
by
the
instant
loss
of
his
freedom
she
was
in
the
same
black
dress
with
soft
folds
and
her
hair
was
done
in
the
same
way
as
yesterday
yet
she
was
quite
different
if
she
had
been
like
that
yesterday
when
he
came
into
the
room
he
would
not
have
failed
to
recognize
her
for
a
moment
she
was
the
same
as
he
had
known
her
almost
as
a
child
and
then
as
prince
andreis
fianc233e
her
eyes
shone
with
a
merry
questioning
brightness
her
face
had
a
tender
and
strangely
mischievous
expression
pierre
dined
and
would
have
sat
there
all
evening
but
princess
marya
went
to
vespers
and
pierre
left
with
them
the
next
day
pierre
came
early
dined
and
sat
there
all
evening
though
princess
marya
and
natasha
were
obviously
glad
of
their
guest
though
the
whole
interest
of
pierres
life
was
now
centered
on
this
house
by
evening
they
had
talked
everything
over
and
the
conversation
passed
constantly
from
one
insignificant
subject
to
another
and
frequently
broke
off
pierre
sat
for
so
long
that
evening
that
princess
marya
and
natasha
kept
glancing
at
each
other
obviously
waiting
for
him
to
go
pierre
saw
it
yet
he
could
not
go
it
was
becoming
painful
awkward
but
he
went
on
sitting
because
he
could
not
get
up
and
go
princess
marya
seeing
no
end
to
it
got
up
first
and
complaining
of
a
migraine
began
saying
goodbye
so
youre
going
to
petersburg
tomorrow
she
asked
no
im
not
pierre
said
hastily
with
surprise
and
as
if
offended
ah
no
to
petersburg
tomorrowonly
im
not
saying
goodbye
ill
come
by
for
your
errands
he
said
standing
in
front
of
princess
marya
blushing
and
not
leaving
natasha
gave
him
her
hand
and
went
out
princess
marya
on
the
contrary
instead
of
leaving
lowered
herself
into
an
armchair
and
looked
at
pierre
sternly
and
attentively
with
her
deep
luminous
gaze
the
fatigue
she
had
clearly
shown
just
before
was
now
completely
gone
she
gave
a
deep
and
drawnout
sigh
as
if
preparing
for
a
long
conversation
in
natashas
absence
all
pierres
confusion
and
awkwardness
instantly
vanished
and
were
replaced
by
excited
animation
he
quickly
moved
an
armchair
quite
close
to
princess
marya
yes
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
said
answering
her
gaze
as
if
it
were
words
princess
help
me
what
am
i
to
do
may
i
hope
princess
my
friend
listen
to
me
i
know
everything
i
know
im
not
worthy
of
her
i
know
its
impossible
to
talk
about
it
now
but
i
want
to
be
a
brother
to
her
no
i
donti
cant
he
stopped
and
rubbed
his
face
and
eyes
with
his
hands
well
there
he
went
on
clearly
making
an
effort
to
speak
coherently
i
dont
know
since
when
ive
loved
her
but
ive
loved
only
her
her
alone
all
my
life
and
i
love
her
so
much
that
i
cant
imagine
my
life
without
her
i
dont
dare
ask
for
her
hand
now
but
the
thought
that
she
might
perhaps
be
mine
and
that
i
might
miss
this
possibilitypossibilityis
terrible
tell
me
may
i
hope
tell
me
what
am
i
to
do
dear
princess
he
said
after
pausing
briefly
and
touching
her
hand
since
she
did
not
reply
im
thinking
about
what
youve
told
me
princess
marya
replied
here
is
what
i
will
tell
you
youre
right
that
to
speak
to
her
of
love
now
the
princess
stopped
she
was
going
to
say
that
to
speak
to
her
of
love
now
was
impossible
but
she
stopped
because
it
was
the
third
day
since
she
had
seen
by
the
suddenly
changed
natasha
not
only
that
natasha
would
not
be
offended
if
pierre
spoke
to
her
of
his
love
but
that
she
wished
only
for
that
to
speak
to
her
nowis
impossible
princess
marya
said
all
the
same
but
what
am
i
to
do
leave
it
to
me
said
princess
marya
i
know
pierre
was
looking
into
princess
maryas
eyes
wellwell
he
said
i
know
that
she
loveswill
love
you
princess
marya
corrected
herself
she
had
barely
managed
to
say
these
words
when
pierre
jumped
up
and
with
a
frightened
face
seized
princess
marya
by
the
hand
what
makes
you
think
so
you
think
that
i
may
hope
you
think
so
yes
i
do
princess
marya
said
smiling
write
to
her
parents
and
leave
it
to
me
ill
tell
her
when
it
can
be
done
i
wish
it
and
my
heart
tells
me
it
will
happen
no
it
cant
be
im
so
happy
but
it
cant
beim
so
happy
no
it
cant

pierre
was
saying
kissing
princess
maryas
hands
you
go
to
petersburg
that
will
be
best
and
ill
write
to
you
she
said
to
petersburg
go
very
well
yes
ill
go
but
may
i
come
to
you
tomorrow
the
next
day
pierre
came
to
say
goodbye
natasha
was
less
animated
than
on
the
previous
days
but
that
day
occasionally
glancing
in
her
eyes
pierre
felt
that
he
was
disappearing
that
neither
he
nor
she
was
there
anymore
but
there
was
just
one
feeling
of
happiness
can
it
be
no
it
cant
he
said
to
himself
at
her
every
glance
gesture
word
which
filled
his
soul
with
joy
when
saying
goodbye
to
her
he
took
her
thin
slender
hand
he
involuntarily
held
it
slightly
longer
in
his
can
it
be
that
this
hand
this
face
these
eyes
all
this
treasure
of
feminine
loveliness
that
is
stranger
to
me
now
can
it
be
that
it
will
all
be
eternally
mine
habitual
the
same
as
i
am
for
myself
no
its
impossible
goodbye
count
she
said
to
him
aloud
ill
be
waiting
very
much
for
you
she
added
in
a
whisper
and
those
simple
words
the
glance
and
expression
of
the
face
that
went
with
them
in
the
course
of
two
months
constituted
a
subject
of
inexhaustible
memories
explanations
and
happy
reveries
for
pierre
ill
be
waiting
very
much
for
you
yes
yes
how
did
she
put
it
yes
ill
be
waiting
very
much
for
you
ah
im
so
happy
what
is
itim
so
happy
pierre
said
to
himself
xix
in
pierres
soul
now
nothing
went
on
like
what
had
gone
on
in
it
under
similar
circumstances
during
his
engagement
to
h233l232ne
he
did
not
repeat
as
then
with
morbid
shame
the
words
he
had
spoken
did
not
say
to
himself
ah
why
didnt
i
say
it
and
why
why
did
i
say
je
vous
aime
then
now
on
the
contrary
he
repeated
in
his
imagination
every
word
of
hers
of
his
with
all
the
details
of
her
face
and
smile
and
did
not
want
either
to
add
or
subtract
he
wanted
only
to
repeat
there
was
now
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
whether
what
he
was
undertaking
was
good
or
bad
only
one
terrible
doubt
sometimes
entered
his
head
isnt
it
all
a
dream
isnt
princess
marya
mistaken
am
i
not
too
proud
and
presumptuous
i
believe
her
but
what
if
suddenly
as
is
bound
to
happen
princess
marya
tells
her
and
she
smiles
and
says
how
strange
hes
certainly
mistaken
doesnt
he
know
that
he
is
a
man
simply
a
man
while
ii
am
quite
a
different
higher
being
that
was
the
only
doubt
that
often
came
to
pierre
he
also
did
not
make
any
plans
now
the
happiness
awaiting
him
seemed
so
incredible
that
it
needed
only
to
come
about
and
there
could
be
nothing
after
it
everything
ended
there
a
joyful
unexpected
madness
of
which
pierre
considered
himself
incapable
came
over
him
the
whole
meaning
of
life
not
only
for
him
but
for
all
the
world
seemed
to
him
to
consist
only
in
his
love
and
the
possibility
of
her
love
for
him
sometimes
all
people
seemed
to
him
to
be
occupied
with
only
one
thinghis
future
happiness
it
sometimes
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
all
rejoicing
as
he
was
and
only
tried
to
conceal
their
joy
pretending
to
be
occupied
with
other
interests
in
every
word
and
movement
he
saw
hints
at
his
happiness
he
often
surprised
people
who
met
him
by
his
significant
happy
glances
and
smiles
expressive
of
a
secret
complicity
but
when
he
realized
that
people
could
not
know
of
his
happiness
he
pitied
them
with
all
his
heart
and
felt
a
desire
to
explain
to
them
somehow
that
everything
they
were
occupied
with
was
completely
nonsensical
and
trifling
not
worthy
of
attention
when
they
offered
him
a
post
in
the
service
or
discussed
some
general
matters
of
state
and
the
war
supposing
that
the
happiness
of
all
people
depended
on
this
or
that
outcome
of
events
he
listened
with
a
meek
condoling
smile
and
surprised
the
people
who
spoke
to
him
with
his
odd
remarks
but
both
those
people
who
seemed
to
pierre
to
understand
the
real
meaning
of
life
that
is
his
feeling
and
those
unfortunates
who
obviously
did
not
understand
itall
people
in
that
period
of
time
appeared
to
him
in
such
a
bright
light
of
the
feeling
shining
within
him
that
without
the
least
effort
meeting
any
person
whatever
he
at
once
saw
in
him
all
that
was
good
and
worthy
of
love
in
examining
his
late
wifes
business
affairs
and
papers
he
experienced
no
feeling
for
her
memory
except
pity
that
she
had
not
known
the
happiness
he
knew
now
prince
vassily
especially
proud
now
of
his
new
post
and
star
appeared
to
him
a
touching
kind
and
pathetic
old
man
later
pierre
often
remembered
that
time
of
happy
insanity
all
the
judgments
of
people
and
circumstances
he
formed
for
himself
in
that
period
of
time
remained
forever
true
for
him
he
not
only
did
not
subsequently
renounce
those
views
of
people
and
things
but
on
the
contrary
in
inner
doubt
and
contradiction
he
would
resort
to
the
views
he
had
had
in
that
time
of
insanity
and
those
views
always
turned
out
to
be
correct
maybe
i
did
seem
strange
and
ridiculous
then
he
thought
but
i
wasnt
as
insane
as
i
seemed
on
the
contrary
i
was
more
intelligent
and
perceptive
then
than
ever
and
i
understood
everything
thats
worth
understanding
in
life
becausei
was
happy
pierres
insanity
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
did
not
wait
as
before
for
personal
reasons
which
he
called
peoples
merits
in
order
to
love
them
but
love
overflowed
his
heart
and
loving
people
without
reason
he
discovered
the
unquestionable
reasons
for
which
it
was
worth
loving
them
xx
from
that
first
evening
when
natasha
after
pierres
departure
told
princess
marya
with
a
joyfully
mocking
smile
that
he
was
just
well
just
like
from
the
bathhouse
with
his
short
little
frock
coat
and
cropped
hair
from
that
moment
something
hidden
and
unknown
to
her
but
irresistible
had
awakened
in
natashas
soul
everythingher
face
her
step
her
gaze
her
voiceeverything
suddenly
changed
in
her
unexpectedly
for
herself
the
force
of
life
her
hopes
for
happiness
came
to
the
surface
and
demanded
to
be
satisfied
from
the
first
evening
it
was
as
if
natasha
forgot
all
that
had
happened
to
her
after
that
she
never
once
complained
of
her
situation
said
not
a
word
about
her
past
and
was
no
longer
afraid
to
make
cheerful
plans
for
the
future
she
spoke
little
of
pierre
but
when
princess
marya
mentioned
him
the
longextinguished
brightness
lit
up
in
her
eyes
and
her
lips
puckered
in
a
strange
smile
the
change
that
took
place
in
natasha
at
first
surprised
princess
marya
but
when
she
understood
its
meaning
this
change
upset
her
can
it
be
that
she
loved
my
brother
so
little
that
she
could
forget
him
so
soon
princess
marya
thought
when
she
pondered
by
herself
the
change
that
had
taken
place
but
when
she
was
with
natasha
she
was
not
angry
with
her
and
did
not
reproach
her
the
awakened
force
of
life
that
took
hold
of
natasha
was
obviously
so
irrepressible
so
unexpected
for
natasha
herself
that
in
her
presence
princess
marya
felt
she
had
no
right
to
reproach
her
even
in
her
heart
natasha
gave
herself
up
so
fully
and
sincerely
to
this
new
feeling
that
she
did
not
even
attempt
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
now
not
grieving
but
joyful
and
gay
when
princess
marya
returned
to
her
room
after
her
talk
that
night
with
pierre
natasha
met
her
on
the
threshold
he
said
it
yes
he
said
it
she
repeated
and
a
joyful
and
at
the
same
time
pathetic
expression
as
if
asking
forgiveness
for
her
joy
lingered
on
natashas
face
i
wanted
to
listen
at
the
door
but
i
knew
youd
tell
me
understandable
and
touching
as
she
found
the
gaze
with
which
natasha
looked
at
her
sorry
as
she
was
to
see
her
agitation
for
the
first
moment
natashas
words
offended
princess
marya
she
remembered
her
brother
and
his
love
but
whats
to
be
done
she
cant
be
otherwise
thought
princess
marya
and
with
a
sad
and
somewhat
stern
face
she
told
natasha
everything
pierre
had
said
to
her
on
hearing
that
he
was
going
to
petersburg
natasha
was
amazed
to
petersburg
she
repeated
as
if
she
did
not
understand
but
looking
intently
into
the
sad
expression
of
princess
maryas
face
she
guessed
the
reason
for
that
sadness
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
marie
she
said
teach
me
what
to
do
im
afraid
to
be
bad
ill
do
whatever
you
say
teach
me
you
love
him
yes
natasha
whispered
then
why
are
you
crying
im
happy
for
you
said
princess
marya
completely
forgiving
natashas
joy
on
account
of
those
tears
it
wont
be
soon
but
some
day
think
what
happiness
when
ill
be
his
wife
and
youll
have
married
nicolas
natasha
i
asked
you
not
to
talk
about
that
lets
talk
about
you
they
were
silent
for
a
while
only
whats
he
going
to
petersburg
for
natasha
said
suddenly
and
hastily
answered
herself
no
no
it
has
to
be
soright
marie
it
has
to
be
so
i
seven
years
had
passed
since
1812
the
churnedup
historical
sea
of
europe
settled
back
within
its
shores
it
seemed
to
have
grown
still
but
the
mysterious
forces
that
move
mankind
mysterious
because
the
laws
that
determine
their
movement
are
unknown
to
us
continued
their
action
though
the
surface
of
the
historical
sea
seemed
immobile
mankind
moved
as
ceaselessly
as
the
movement
of
time
various
groups
of
human
connections
were
made
and
unmade
causes
were
prepared
for
the
formation
and
decomposition
of
states
for
the
displacements
of
peoples
the
historical
sea
did
not
as
formerly
direct
its
surges
from
one
shore
to
another
it
seethed
in
its
depths
historical
figures
were
not
as
formerly
borne
by
the
waves
from
one
shore
to
another
they
now
seemed
to
turn
in
place
historical
figures
who
formerly
at
the
head
of
armies
reflected
the
movement
of
the
masses
by
ordering
wars
marches
battles
now
reflected
the
seething
movement
through
political
and
diplomatic
considerations
laws
treatises
historians
call
this
activity
of
historical
figures
the
reaction
describing
the
activity
of
these
historical
figures
who
were
in
their
opinion
the
cause
of
what
they
call
the
reaction
historians
severely
condemn
them
all
the
wellknown
people
of
that
time
from
alexander
and
napoleon
to
mme
de
sta235l
photius
schelling
fichte
chateaubriand
and
others
pass
before
their
severe
judgment
and
are
either
acquitted
or
condemned
depending
on
whether
they
contributed
to
progress
or
the
reaction
in
russia
according
to
their
descriptions
a
reaction
was
also
going
on
in
that
period
of
time
and
the
chief
perpetrator
of
this
reaction
was
alexander
ithe
same
alexander
i
who
according
to
their
own
descriptions
was
the
chief
perpetrator
of
the
liberal
initiatives
of
his
reign
and
of
the
salvation
of
russia
in
presentday
russian
literature
from
the
schoolboy
to
the
learned
historian
there
is
not
a
person
who
does
not
cast
his
little
stone
at
alexander
i
for
his
wrong
actions
during
this
period
of
his
reign
he
should
have
acted
thus
and
so
in
this
case
he
acted
well
in
that
badly
he
behaved
himself
splendidly
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
and
during
the
year
twelve
but
he
acted
badly
in
granting
poland
a
constitution
forming
the
holy
alliance
giving
power
to
arakcheev
encouraging
golitsyn
and
mysticism
and
then
encouraging
shishkov
and
photius
he
did
badly
in
occupying
himself
with
the
frontline
units
of
the
army
he
acted
badly
in
disbanding
the
semyonovsky
regiment
and
so
on
one
would
have
to
fill
ten
pages
with
writing
in
order
to
enumerate
all
that
the
historians
reproach
him
with
on
the
basis
of
that
knowledge
of
the
good
of
mankind
which
they
possess
what
do
these
reproaches
mean
the
very
actions
for
which
the
historians
approve
of
alexander
i
such
as
the
liberal
initiatives
of
the
reign
the
struggle
with
napoleon
the
firmness
he
showed
in
the
year
twelve
and
the
campaign
of
the
year
thirteendo
they
not
all
come
from
the
same
sources
from
the
conditions
of
blood
upbringing
life
that
made
the
person
of
alexander
what
he
was
and
from
which
also
come
the
actions
for
which
the
historians
blame
him
such
as
the
holy
alliance
the
restoration
of
poland
the
reaction
of
the
twenties
in
what
consists
the
essence
of
these
reproaches
it
is
that
a
historical
figure
such
as
alexander
i
a
figure
who
stood
on
the
highest
possible
step
of
human
power
as
if
at
the
focal
point
of
the
blinding
light
of
all
the
historical
rays
concentrated
upon
him
a
figure
subject
to
the
strongest
influences
in
the
worldof
intrigues
deceptions
flattery
selfdelusionwhich
are
inseparable
from
power
a
figure
who
felt
upon
himself
at
every
moment
of
his
life
the
responsibility
for
all
that
was
happening
in
europe
and
not
an
invented
figure
but
a
living
one
and
like
every
man
with
his
personal
habits
passions
strivings
for
goodness
beauty
truththat
this
figure
fifty
years
ago
was
not
so
much
not
virtuous
the
historians
do
not
reproach
him
for
that
but
did
not
have
those
views
of
the
good
of
mankind
now
possessed
by
a
professor
who
from
his
youth
has
been
taken
up
with
learning
that
is
reading
books
attending
lectures
and
copying
things
from
these
books
and
lectures
into
a
notebook
but
even
if
we
suppose
that
alexander
i
was
mistaken
fifty
years
ago
in
his
views
of
what
the
good
of
the
peoples
was
we
must
involuntarily
suppose
that
the
historian
judging
alexander
will
in
the
same
way
after
the
passing
of
some
time
turn
out
to
be
incorrect
in
his
view
of
what
the
good
of
mankind
is
this
supposition
is
the
more
natural
and
necessary
in
that
as
we
follow
the
development
of
historical
science
we
see
that
the
view
of
what
the
good
of
mankind
is
changes
with
each
new
year
with
each
new
writer
so
that
in
ten
years
what
seemed
good
looks
like
evil
and
vice
versa
what
is
more
in
one
and
the
same
time
we
find
completely
opposite
views
among
historians
as
to
what
was
evil
and
what
was
good
some
set
the
holy
alliance
and
the
granting
of
a
constitution
to
poland
to
the
credit
others
to
the
reproach
of
alexander
of
the
activity
of
alexander
and
napoleon
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
it
was
useful
or
harmful
for
we
cannot
say
what
it
was
useful
or
harmful
for
if
that
activity
displeases
someone
it
displeases
him
only
because
it
does
not
coincide
with
his
limited
notion
of
what
the
good
is
the
preservation
of
my
fathers
house
in
moscow
in
the
year
twelve
or
the
glory
of
the
russian
army
or
the
flourishing
of
the
universities
of
petersburg
and
elsewhere
or
the
freedom
of
poland
or
the
might
of
russia
or
the
balance
of
europe
or
a
certain
sort
of
european
enlightenment
known
as
progress
may
seem
good
to
me
but
i
must
acknowledge
that
besides
those
purposes
the
activity
of
every
historical
figure
had
other
more
general
purposes
inaccessible
to
me
but
let
us
suppose
that
socalled
science
has
the
possibility
of
reconciling
all
contradictions
and
possesses
an
immutable
yardstick
of
good
and
evil
for
historical
figures
and
events
let
us
suppose
that
alexander
could
have
done
everything
otherwise
let
us
suppose
that
according
to
the
prescriptions
of
those
who
accuse
him
those
who
profess
a
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
purpose
of
mankinds
movement
he
could
have
arranged
everything
according
to
the
program
of
nationhood
freedom
equality
and
progress
there
seems
to
be
no
other
which
his
presentday
accusers
would
have
provided
for
him
let
us
suppose
that
this
program
was
possible
and
was
drawn
up
and
that
alexander
acted
according
to
it
what
would
have
become
then
of
the
activity
of
all
those
people
who
opposed
the
then
tendency
of
the
governmentan
activity
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
historians
was
good
and
useful
there
would
have
been
no
such
activity
there
would
have
been
no
life
there
would
have
been
nothing
if
we
allow
that
human
life
can
be
governed
by
reason
the
possibility
of
life
is
annihilated
ii
if
we
allow
as
historians
do
that
great
men
lead
mankind
to
the
achievement
of
certain
purposes
which
consist
either
in
the
greatness
of
russia
or
france
or
in
the
balance
of
europe
or
in
spreading
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
or
in
general
progress
or
in
whatever
else
then
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
history
without
the
notions
of
chance
and
genius
if
the
purpose
of
the
european
wars
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
was
the
greatness
of
russia
that
purpose
could
have
been
achieved
without
any
of
the
preceding
wars
and
without
the
invasion
if
the
purpose
was
the
greatness
of
france
it
could
have
been
achieved
without
the
revolution
and
without
the
empire
if
the
purpose
was
the
spreading
of
ideas
printing
would
have
carried
it
out
far
better
than
soldiers
if
the
purpose
was
the
progress
of
civilization
it
is
quite
easy
to
suppose
that
besides
the
destruction
of
people
and
their
wealth
there
are
other
more
expedient
ways
to
spread
civilization
why
did
it
happen
this
way
and
not
otherwise
because
this
is
how
it
happened
chance
made
the
situation
genius
profited
from
it
says
history
but
what
is
chance
what
is
genius
the
words
chance
and
genius
do
not
designate
anything
that
actually
exists
and
therefore
cannot
be
defined
these
words
designate
only
a
certain
degree
of
understanding
of
phenomenon
i
do
not
know
why
suchandsuch
a
phenomenon
occurs
i
think
that
i
cannot
know
it
therefore
i
do
not
want
to
know
it
and
i
say
chance
i
see
a
power
that
produces
effects
incommensurate
with
common
human
qualities
i
do
not
know
why
that
happens
and
i
say
genius
for
a
flock
of
sheep
the
sheep
that
the
shepherd
takes
into
a
separate
pen
to
be
fed
and
that
grows
twice
as
fat
as
the
others
must
seem
a
genius
and
the
circumstance
that
every
evening
precisely
this
same
sheep
ends
up
not
in
the
general
fold
but
in
a
separate
pen
to
have
oats
and
that
this
precisely
this
same
sheep
spilling
over
with
fat
is
killed
for
meat
must
appear
as
an
astonishing
conjunction
of
genius
with
a
whole
series
of
extraordinary
chances
but
the
sheep
need
only
stop
thinking
that
everything
that
happens
to
them
occurs
only
to
achieve
their
sheep
purposes
they
need
only
allow
that
what
happens
to
them
may
have
purposes
incomprehensible
to
themand
they
will
immediately
see
the
unity
the
consistency
in
what
happens
to
a
fattenedup
sheep
even
if
they
do
not
know
the
purpose
for
which
he
is
being
fattened
up
they
will
at
least
know
that
all
that
happened
to
the
sheep
did
not
happen
by
chance
and
they
will
no
longer
need
the
notions
of
chance
or
of
genius
only
by
renouncing
the
knowledge
of
an
immediate
comprehensible
purpose
and
admitting
that
the
final
purpose
is
inaccessible
to
us
will
we
see
the
consistency
and
expediency
in
the
life
of
historical
figures
the
cause
will
be
revealed
to
us
of
that
effect
incommensurate
with
common
human
qualities
which
they
produce
and
we
will
not
need
the
words
chance
and
genius
we
need
only
admit
that
the
purpose
of
the
upheavals
of
the
european
peoples
is
unknown
to
us
while
we
know
only
facts
which
consist
in
murders
first
in
france
then
in
italy
in
africa
in
prussia
in
austria
in
spain
in
russia
and
that
the
movements
from
west
to
east
and
from
east
to
west
constitute
the
essence
and
purpose
of
these
events
and
not
only
will
we
not
need
to
see
anything
exceptional
and
marked
by
genius
in
the
characters
of
napoleon
and
alexander
but
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
picture
these
figures
otherwise
than
as
the
same
people
as
all
the
rest
and
not
only
will
we
no
longer
need
to
explain
by
chance
those
small
events
that
made
these
men
what
they
were
but
it
will
be
clear
that
all
those
small
events
were
necessary
in
renouncing
knowledge
of
the
final
purpose
we
will
clearly
understand
that
just
as
it
is
impossible
to
invent
for
any
plant
a
flower
and
seed
that
correspond
to
it
more
than
those
it
produces
so
it
is
impossible
to
invent
two
other
persons
with
all
their
past
who
would
correspond
to
such
a
degree
in
such
minute
detail
to
the
purpose
they
were
meant
to
fulfill
iii
the
fundamental
essential
meaning
of
the
european
events
of
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
is
the
military
movement
of
masses
of
european
peoples
from
west
to
east
and
then
from
east
to
west
the
initial
movement
was
from
west
to
east
for
the
peoples
of
the
west
to
be
able
to
perform
that
military
movement
to
moscow
which
they
did
perform
it
was
necessary
1
that
they
form
a
military
group
of
such
size
as
to
be
able
to
withstand
a
clash
with
the
military
group
of
the
east
2
that
they
renounce
all
established
traditions
and
customs
and
3
that
in
performing
their
military
movement
they
have
at
their
head
a
man
who
could
justify
both
to
himself
and
to
them
the
deceptions
robberies
and
murders
which
were
to
be
performed
and
which
accompanied
that
movement
and
starting
with
the
french
revolution
the
old
insufficiently
large
group
is
destroyed
old
customs
and
traditions
are
obliterated
step
by
step
a
group
of
a
new
size
is
produced
along
with
new
customs
and
traditions
and
that
man
is
prepared
who
is
to
stand
at
the
head
of
the
future
movement
and
bear
upon
himself
all
the
responsibility
for
what
is
to
be
performed
a
man
without
convictions
without
customs
without
traditions
without
a
name
not
even
a
frenchman
seemingly
by
the
strangest
chances
moves
among
all
the
parties
stirring
up
france
and
without
attaching
himself
to
any
of
them
is
borne
up
to
a
conspicuous
place
the
ignorance
of
his
associates
the
weakness
and
insignificance
of
his
opponents
the
sincerity
of
his
lies
and
the
brilliant
and
selfconfident
limitedness
of
this
man
move
him
to
the
head
of
the
army
a
brilliant
complement
of
soldiers
from
the
italian
army
the
reluctance
of
his
adversaries
to
fight
his
childish
boldness
and
selfconfidence
win
him
military
glory
countless
numbers
of
socalled
chances
accompany
him
everywhere
the
disgrace
he
falls
into
with
the
rulers
of
france
turns
to
his
advantage
his
attempts
to
change
the
path
he
is
destined
for
fail
he
is
not
accepted
into
the
russian
service
and
fails
to
obtain
an
appointment
in
turkey
during
the
wars
in
italy
several
times
he
is
on
the
brink
of
destruction
and
is
saved
each
time
in
an
unexpected
way
the
russian
troops
the
very
ones
who
can
destroy
his
glory
do
not
for
various
diplomatic
considerations
enter
europe
while
he
is
there
on
his
return
from
italy
he
finds
the
government
in
paris
in
that
process
of
decomposition
in
which
the
people
who
happen
to
be
in
this
government
are
inevitably
wiped
out
and
obliterated
and
a
way
out
of
this
dangerous
situation
appears
to
him
of
itself
consisting
in
a
senseless
groundless
expedition
to
africa
again
the
same
socalled
chances
accompany
him
impregnable
malta
surrenders
without
a
shot
fired
the
most
imprudent
orders
are
crowned
with
success
the
enemy
fleet
which
afterwards
will
not
let
a
single
boat
pass
lets
pass
a
whole
army
in
africa
a
whole
series
of
villainies
is
committed
upon
the
allbutunarmed
inhabitants
and
the
people
who
commit
these
villainies
and
in
particular
their
leader
assure
themselves
that
this
is
beautiful
that
this
is
glory
that
this
is
like
caesar
and
alexander
the
great
and
that
this
is
good
that
ideal
of
glory
and
greatness
which
consists
not
only
in
considering
nothing
that
one
does
as
bad
but
in
being
proud
of
ones
every
crime
ascribing
some
incomprehensible
supernatural
meaning
to
itthat
ideal
which
was
to
guide
this
man
and
the
people
connected
with
him
is
freely
developed
in
africa
everything
he
does
succeeds
the
plague
leaves
him
untouched
the
cruel
murder
of
prisoners
is
not
imputed
to
him
in
fault
his
childishly
imprudent
groundless
and
ignoble
departure
from
africa
leaving
his
comrades
in
trouble
is
set
to
his
credit
and
again
the
enemy
fleet
misses
him
twice
at
the
time
when
already
completely
intoxicated
by
the
successful
crimes
he
has
committed
prepared
for
his
role
he
arrives
in
paris
without
any
aim
the
decomposition
of
the
republican
government
which
could
have
destroyed
him
a
year
earlier
has
reached
the
ultimate
degree
and
his
presence
clear
of
any
parties
can
now
only
elevate
him
he
has
no
plan
at
all
he
is
afraid
of
everything
but
the
parties
seize
upon
him
and
demand
his
participation
he
alone
with
his
ideal
of
glory
and
greatness
worked
out
in
italy
and
egypt
with
his
insane
selfadoration
with
his
boldness
in
crime
with
his
sincerity
in
lyinghe
alone
can
justify
what
is
to
be
performed
he
is
needed
for
the
place
that
awaits
him
and
therefore
almost
independently
of
his
will
and
despite
his
irresolution
his
lack
of
a
plan
all
the

he
is
drawn
into
a
conspiracy
the
purpose
of
which
is
the
seizure
of
power
and
the
conspiracy
is
crowned
with
success
he
is
pushed
into
a
meeting
of
the
rulers

he
wants
to
flee
considering
himself
lost
he
pretends
to
faint
he
says
senseless
things
which
should
have
been
his
ruin
but
the
rulers
of
france
once
sharpwitted
and
proud
now
sensing
that
their
role
has
been
played
out
are
still
more
confused
than
he
is

do
not

the

that
needed
to
be
said
in

to
hold
on
to

and
destroy

by

the

forces
him
to

more
forcefully

unexpectedly

into

austrians

surrender

him
the
victory

by

not

all
of

as

with
the

of

which
does
not
participate
in
the
events
about
to
take
place
all
people
despite
their
former
horror
and
loathing
for
his
crimes
now
recognize
his
power
the
title
he
has
given
himself
and
his
ideal
of
greatness
and
glory
which
to
all
of
them
seems
something
beautiful
and
reasonable
as
if
trying
themselves
out
and
preparing
for
the
coming
movement
the
forces
of
the
west
in
1805

repeatedly
push
eastward
gaining
strength
and
growing
in
numbers
in
1811
the
group
of
people
formed
in
france
merges
into
one
huge
group
with
the
peoples
of
the
center
along
with
the
everincreasing
group
of
people
the
power
of
justification
of
the
man
who
stands
at
the
head
of
the
movement
also
develops
further
during
the
tenyear
preparatory
period
preceding
the
big
movement
this
man
is
brought
together
with
all
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
the
unmasked
rulers
of
the
world
cannot
oppose
any
intelligent
ideal
to
napoleons
ideal
of
glory
and
greatness
which
has
no
meaning
one
after
another
they
rush
to
demonstrate
their
nonentity
to
him
the
king
of
prussia
sends
his
wife
to
seek
favor
with
the
great
man
the
emperor
of
austria
considers
it
a
favor
that
this
man
receives
a
daughter
of
the
caesars
in
his
bed
the
pope
guardian
of
what
the
peoples
hold
sacred
lets
his
religion
serve
the
great
mans
rise
it
is
not
so
much
napoleon
himself
who
prepares
for
the
fulfilling
of
his
role
as
everything
around
him
prepares
him
to
take
upon
himself
all
responsibility
for
what
is
being
performed
and
is
to
be
performed
there
is
no
action
no
villainy
or
petty
deception
committed
by
him
that
is
not
reflected
at
once
on
the
lips
of
those
around
him
in
the
form
of
a
great
deed
the
best
celebration
the
germans
can
think
up
for
him
is
to
celebrate
jena
and
auerst228dt
not
only
is
he
great
but
his
ancestors
his
brothers
his
stepsons
his
brothersinlaw
are
great
everything
is
done
to
deprive
him
of
the
last
powers
of
reason
and
prepare
him
for
his
terrible
role
and
when
he
is
ready
the
forces
are
ready
as
well
the
invasion
pushes
eastward
it
reaches
its
final
goalmoscow
the
capital
is
taken
the
russian
army
is
annihilated
more
than
any
enemy
armies
were
ever
annihilated
in
previous
wars
from
austerlitz
to
wagram
but
suddenly
instead
of
the
chances
and
genius
that
up
to
now
have
led
him
so
consistently
through
an
unbroken
series
of
successes
to
the
appointed
goal
there
appear
a
countless
number
of
reverse
chances
from
a
head
cold
at
borodino
to
the
frosts
and
the
spark
that
sets
fire
to
moscow
and
instead
of
genius
there
appears
an
unexampled
stupidity
and
baseness
the
invasion
flees
returns
flees
again
and
now
all
the
chances
are
constantly
not
for
but
against
him
a
countermovement
is
performed
from
east
to
west
which
remarkably
resembles
the
preceding
movement
from
west
to
east
as
in
1805
1807
1809
the
same
attempts
at
movement
from
east
to
west
precede
the
big
movement
there
is
the
same
merging
into
a
group
of
huge
dimensions
the
same
joining
of
peoples
of
the
center
to
the
movement
the
same
hesitation
midway
and
the
same
swiftness
as
they
near
the
goal
paris
the
ultimate
goal
is
reached
the
napoleonic
government
and
army
are
destroyed
napoleon
himself
no
longer
has
any
meaning
all
his
actions
are
obviously
pathetic
and
vile
but
again
an
inexplicable
chance
occurs
the
allies
hate
napoleon
in
whom
they
see
the
cause
of
their
calamities
deprived
of
strength
and
power
exposed
in
his
villainies
and
perfidies
he
ought
to
appear
to
them
as
he
appeared
ten
years
earlier
and
one
year
lateras
a
bandit
and
outlaw
but
by
some
strange
chance
no
one
sees
it
his
role
is
not
finished
yet
the
man
who
ten
years
earlier
and
one
year
later
was
considered
a
bandit
and
outlaw
is
sent
a
twoday
sail
from
france
to
an
island
given
into
his
possession
with
his
guards
and
several
million
which
are
paid
to
him
for
some
reason
iv
the
movement
of
peoples
begins
to
settle
within
its
shores
the
waves
of
the
big
movement
flood
back
and
on
the
calmed
sea
eddies
form
over
which
diplomats
skim
imagining
that
it
is
precisely
they
who
have
brought
about
the
calming
of
the
movement
but
the
calmed
sea
suddenly
rises
to
the
diplomats
it
seems
that
they
that
their
disagreements
are
the
cause
of
this
new
upsurge
of
forces
they
expect
war
among
their
sovereigns
the
situation
seems
insoluble
to
them
but
the
wave
which
they
can
feel
rising
does
not
break
from
where
they
expect
the
same
wave
rises
from
the
same
point
of
departureparis
the
last
backwash
of
the
movement
from
the
west
occurs
the
backwash
that
is
to
resolve
the
seemingly
unresolvable
diplomatic
difficulties
and
put
an
end
to
the
military
movement
of
that
period
the
man
who
devastated
france
alone
without
conspiracy
without
soldiers
comes
back
to
france
any
guard
can
arrest
him
but
by
a
strange
chance
not
only
does
no
one
arrest
him
but
everyone
greets
with
rapture
the
man
whom
they
cursed
the
day
before
and
will
curse
a
month
later
this
man
is
still
needed
to
justify
the
last
joint
act
the
act
is
performed
the
last
role
has
been
played
the
actor
is
told
to
undress
and
wash
off
his
greasepaint
and
rouge
there
is
no
more
need
for
him
and
several
years
go
by
during
which
this
man
in
solitude
on
his
island
plays
a
pathetic
comedy
before
himself
pettily
intriguing
and
lying
to
justify
his
actions
when
that
justification
is
no
longer
needed
and
showing
to
the
whole
world
what
it
was
that
people
took
for
strength
while
an
unseen
hand
was
guiding
him
the
stage
manager
having
finished
the
drama
and
undressed
the
actor
shows
him
to
us
look
at
what
you
believed
in
here
he
is
do
you
see
now
that
it
was
not
he
but
i
who
moved
you
but
blinded
by
the
force
of
the
movement
people
long
fail
to
understand
that
still
greater
consistency
and
necessity
are
presented
in
the
life
of
alexander
i
the
figure
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
countermovement
from
east
to
west
what
does
that
man
need
who
overshadowing
others
would
stand
at
the
head
of
this
movement
from
east
to
west
he
needs
a
sense
of
justice
a
concern
for
the
affairs
of
europe
but
a
distant
concern
unobscured
by
petty
interests
he
needs
a
moral
superiority
over
his
associatesthe
sovereigns
of
the
time
he
needs
a
mild
and
attractive
personality
he
needs
a
personal
grievance
against
napoleon
and
all
this
is
there
in
alexander
i
all
this
has
been
prepared
by
countless
socalled
chances
throughout
his
past
life
his
upbringing
his
liberal
initiatives
the
advisers
surrounding
him
austerlitz
tilsit
erfurt
during
the
national
war
this
figure
is
inactive
since
he
is
not
needed
but
once
the
necessity
for
a
general
european
war
appears
this
figure
at
a
given
moment
appears
in
his
place
and
uniting
the
peoples
of
europe
leads
them
to
their
goal
the
goal
is
achieved
after
the
final
war
of
1815
alexander
finds
himself
at
the
height
of
all
possible
human
power
how
does
he
use
it
alexander
i
the
pacifier
of
europe
a
man
who
from
his
youth
strove
only
for
the
good
of
his
people
the
first
initiator
of
liberal
innovations
in
his
fatherland
now
when
he
seems
to
possess
the
greatest
power
and
therefore
the
possibility
of
doing
good
for
his
people
while
napoleon
in
exile
makes
childish
and
deceitful
plans
for
how
he
would
have
made
mankind
happy
if
he
had
had
power
alexander
i
having
fulfilled
his
vocation
and
felt
the
hand
of
god
upon
him
suddenly
recognizes
the
insignificance
of
this
imaginary
power
turns
away
from
it
puts
it
into
the
hands
of
people
he
despises
and
who
are
despicable
and
says
only
not
unto
us
not
unto
us
but
unto
thy
name
i
am
also
a
man
like
you
let
me
live
like
a
man
and
think
of
my
soul
and
of
god
as
the
sun
and
every
atom
of
the
ether
is
a
sphere
complete
in
itself
and
at
the
same
time
only
an
atom
of
a
whole
that
is
inaccessible
to
man
in
its
enormityso
too
every
person
bears
his
own
purposes
within
himself
and
yet
bears
them
in
order
to
serve
general
purposes
that
are
inaccessible
to
man
a
bee
sitting
on
a
flower
stung
a
child
and
the
child
is
afraid
of
bees
and
says
that
a
bees
purpose
consists
in
stinging
people
a
poet
admires
a
bee
sucking
from
the
cup
of
a
flower
and
says
that
a
bees
purpose
consists
in
sucking
up
the
fragrance
of
flowers
a
beekeeper
noting
how
a
bee
gathers
flower
pollen
and
brings
it
to
the
hive
says
that
a
bees
purpose
consists
in
gathering
honey
another
beekeeper
who
has
studied
the
life
of
a
hive
more
closely
says
that
a
bee
collects
pollen
in
order
to
feed
the
young
bees
and
rear
a
queen
and
that
its
purpose
consists
in
reproducing
its
kind
a
botanist
notes
that
as
a
bee
lands
with
pollen
on
the
pistil
of
a
dioecious
flower
it
fertilizes
it
and
in
that
the
botanist
sees
the
bees
purpose
another
observing
the
migration
of
plants
sees
that
the
bee
contributes
to
that
migration
and
this
new
observer
may
say
it
is
in
this
that
the
bees
purpose
consists
but
the
final
purpose
of
the
bee
is
exhausted
neither
by
the
one
nor
the
other
nor
the
third
purpose
that
human
reason
is
able
to
discover
the
higher
human
reason
rises
in
the
discovery
of
these
purposes
the
more
obvious
for
it
is
the
inaccessibility
of
the
final
purpose
all
that
is
accessible
to
man
is
the
observation
of
the
correspondence
between
the
life
of
a
bee
and
other
phenomena
of
life
it
is
the
same
for
the
purposes
of
historical
figures
and
peoples
v
the
wedding
of
natasha
who
married
bezukhov
in
the
year
thirteen
was
the
last
joyful
event
in
the
family
of
the
old
rostovs
count
ilya
andreevich
died
that
same
year
and
as
always
happens
with
his
death
the
old
family
broke
up
the
events
of
the
past
yearthe
moscow
fire
and
the
flight
from
it
the
death
of
prince
andrei
and
natashas
despair
the
death
of
petya
the
countesss
griefall
this
like
one
blow
after
another
fell
on
the
old
counts
head
it
seemed
he
did
not
understand
and
felt
unable
to
understand
the
significance
of
all
these
events
and
morally
bowed
his
old
head
as
if
expecting
and
asking
for
new
blows
that
would
finish
him
off
he
seemed
now
frightened
and
perplexed
now
unnaturally
animated
and
enterprising
natashas
wedding
occupied
him
for
some
time
by
its
external
side
he
ordered
dinners
suppers
and
obviously
wanted
to
appear
cheerful
but
his
cheerfulness
did
not
communicate
itself
as
formerly
but
on
the
contrary
evoked
compassion
in
people
who
knew
and
loved
him
after
the
departure
of
pierre
and
his
wife
he
grew
quiet
and
began
to
complain
of
anguish
a
few
days
later
he
fell
ill
and
took
to
his
bed
despite
the
doctors
reassurances
he
understood
from
the
first
days
of
his
illness
that
he
would
not
get
up
again
the
countess
spent
two
weeks
in
an
armchair
by
his
bedside
without
undressing
each
time
she
gave
him
his
medicine
he
sobbed
and
silently
kissed
her
hand
on
the
last
day
weeping
he
begged
forgiveness
of
his
wife
and
absent
son
for
having
ruined
their
propertythe
chief
guilt
he
felt
hanging
over
him
having
taken
communion
and
been
anointed
he
died
quietly
and
the
next
day
a
crowd
of
acquaintances
who
came
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
the
deceased
filled
the
rostovs
rented
apartment
all
these
acquaintances
who
had
dined
and
danced
so
many
times
in
his
house
who
had
laughed
at
him
so
many
times
now
said
with
the
same
feeling
of
inner
reproach
and
affection
as
if
justifying
themselves
before
someone
yes
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
an
excellent
man
you
dont
meet
such
men
nowadaysand
who
doesnt
have
his
weaknesses
precisely
at
a
time
when
the
counts
affairs
had
become
so
entangled
that
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
how
it
would
all
end
if
it
went
on
a
year
longer
he
unexpectedly
died
nikolai
was
with
the
russian
troops
in
paris
when
the
news
of
his
fathers
death
reached
him
he
immediately
sent
in
his
resignation
and
without
waiting
to
be
discharged
took
a
leave
and
went
to
moscow
the
state
of
their
financial
affairs
became
perfectly
clear
within
a
month
after
the
counts
death
astonishing
everyone
by
the
enormity
of
the
sum
of
various
little
debts
the
existence
of
which
no
one
even
suspected
the
debts
were
twice
greater
than
the
property
itself
relations
and
friends
advised
nikolai
to
renounce
the
inheritance
but
nikolai
saw
renouncing
the
inheritance
as
an
expression
of
reproach
to
his
fathers
memory
which
was
sacred
to
him
and
therefore
would
not
hear
of
it
and
accepted
the
inheritance
with
the
obligation
to
pay
off
the
debts
the
creditors
who
had
been
silent
for
so
long
being
bound
while
the
count
was
alive
by
that
undefined
but
powerful
influence
which
his
lax
kindness
had
on
them
suddenly
all
sued
for
recovery
there
was
as
always
happens
a
competition
for
who
would
get
paid
first
and
those
very
people
who
like
mitenka
and
others
held
uncovered
promissory
notes
as
gifts
now
turned
out
to
be
the
most
demanding
creditors
nikolai
was
given
no
time
or
respite
and
those
who
by
the
look
of
it
had
felt
sorry
for
the
old
man
who
was
to
blame
for
their
losses
if
there
were
losses
now
fell
mercilessly
on
the
young
heir
obviously
guiltless
before
them
who
voluntarily
took
the
payment
upon
himself
not
one
of
nikolais
proposed
schemes
succeeded
the
estate
went
under
the
hammer
for
half
its
value
and
half
of
the
debts
still
remained
unpaid
nikolai
accepted
the
thirty
thousand
offered
him
by
his
brotherinlaw
bezukhov
to
pay
off
the
portion
of
debts
he
recognized
as
real
debts
of
money
and
to
avoid
being
sent
to
jail
for
the
remaining
debts
as
his
creditors
threatened
he
went
into
the
service
again
to
go
to
the
army
where
he
stood
to
get
the
first
vacant
post
as
regimental
commander
was
impossible
because
his
mother
now
clung
to
her
son
as
her
last
enticement
to
life
and
therefore
despite
his
reluctance
to
remain
in
moscow
in
the
circle
of
people
who
had
known
him
formerly
despite
his
loathing
of
the
civil
service
he
accepted
a
civil
post
in
moscow
and
having
taken
off
his
beloved
uniform
settled
with
his
mother
and
sonya
in
a
small
apartment
on
the
sivtsev
vrazhek
natasha
and
pierre
were
living
in
petersburg
at
the
time
and
had
no
clear
idea
of
nikolais
situation
having
borrowed
money
from
his
brotherinlaw
nikolai
tried
to
conceal
his
disastrous
situation
from
him
his
situation
was
especially
bad
because
he
not
only
had
to
support
himself
sonya
and
his
mother
on
his
twelvehundredrouble
salary
but
had
to
support
his
mother
in
such
a
way
that
she
did
not
notice
they
were
poor
the
countess
could
not
understand
the
possibility
of
life
without
the
conditions
of
luxury
she
had
been
accustomed
to
since
childhood
and
not
realizing
how
difficult
it
was
for
her
son
she
demanded
now
a
carriage
they
did
not
have
to
send
for
a
lady
acquaintance
now
some
expensive
food
for
herself
and
wine
for
her
son
now
money
so
as
to
make
a
surprise
gift
to
natasha
sonya
or
nikolai
himself
sonya
ran
the
household
took
care
of
her
aunt
read
aloud
to
her
put
up
with
her
caprices
and
secret
dislike
and
helped
nikolai
to
conceal
from
the
old
countess
the
situation
of
poverty
in
which
they
found
themselves
nikolai
felt
he
owed
an
unrepayable
debt
of
gratitude
to
sonya
for
all
she
was
doing
for
his
mother
admired
her
patience
and
devotion
but
tried
to
distance
himself
from
her
in
his
heart
it
was
as
if
he
reproached
her
for
being
too
perfect
and
having
nothing
to
be
reproached
for
in
her
there
was
everything
for
which
people
are
appreciated
but
there
was
little
of
what
would
make
him
love
her
and
he
felt
that
the
more
he
appreciated
her
the
less
he
loved
her
he
took
her
at
her
word
in
the
letter
in
which
she
had
given
him
his
freedom
and
behaved
with
her
now
as
if
all
that
had
been
between
them
was
long
forgotten
and
could
by
no
means
be
repeated
nikolais
situation
was
becoming
worse
and
worse
the
thought
of
putting
something
aside
from
his
salary
proved
a
dream
he
not
only
put
nothing
aside
but
in
satisfying
his
mothers
demands
accumulated
small
debts
no
way
out
of
his
situation
presented
itself
to
him
the
thought
of
marrying
a
rich
heiress
which
his
female
relations
suggested
to
him
he
found
revolting
the
other
way
out
of
his
situationhis
mothers
deathnever
entered
his
head
he
wished
for
nothing
hoped
for
nothing
and
deep
in
his
heart
took
a
gloomy
and
stern
pleasure
in
the
unmurmuring
endurance
of
his
situation
he
tried
to
avoid
former
acquaintances
with
their
condolences
and
offers
of
insulting
assistance
avoided
all
distractions
and
amusements
and
even
at
home
did
nothing
except
lay
out
patience
with
his
mother
silently
pace
the
room
and
smoke
pipe
after
pipe
it
was
is
if
he
was
carefully
maintaining
in
himself
that
gloomy
state
of
mind
which
alone
enabled
him
to
endure
his
situation
vi
at
the
beginning
of
winter
princess
marya
came
to
moscow
from
town
rumors
she
learned
about
the
situation
of
the
rostovs
and
how
the
son
was
sacrificing
himself
for
his
motheras
they
said
in
town
i
never
expected
anything
else
from
him
princess
marya
said
to
herself
feeling
a
joyful
confirmation
of
her
love
for
him
remembering
her
friendly
and
almost
familial
relations
with
their
whole
family
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
visit
them
but
remembering
her
relations
with
nikolai
in
voronezh
she
was
afraid
of
it
nevertheless
making
a
great
effort
with
herself
several
weeks
after
her
arrival
in
town
she
went
to
see
the
rostovs
nikolai
was
the
first
to
meet
her
because
one
could
get
to
the
countesss
room
only
through
his
at
his
first
glance
at
her
nikolais
face
instead
of
the
expression
of
joy
that
princess
marya
expected
to
see
on
it
assumed
an
expression
of
coldness
dryness
and
pride
such
as
the
princess
had
never
seen
before
nikolai
asked
about
her
health
took
her
to
his
mother
and
having
sat
for
about
five
minutes
left
the
room
when
she
left
the
countess
nikolai
met
her
again
and
with
particular
solemnity
and
dryness
saw
her
to
the
front
hall
he
did
not
say
a
word
in
reply
to
her
remarks
about
the
countesss
health
what
is
it
to
you
leave
me
alone
his
gaze
said
whats
she
prowling
around
for
what
does
she
want
i
cant
bear
these
ladies
and
all
these
gentilities
he
said
aloud
in
sonyas
presence
evidently
unable
to
hold
back
his
vexation
once
the
princesss
carriage
had
driven
away
from
the
house
ah
nicolas
how
can
you
say
such
things
said
sonya
barely
concealing
her
joy
shes
so
kind
and
maman
loves
her
so
nikolai
said
nothing
and
would
have
preferred
not
to
talk
about
the
princess
anymore
but
since
the
time
of
her
visit
the
old
countess
began
to
talk
about
her
several
times
a
day
the
countess
praised
her
demanded
that
her
son
call
on
her
expressed
a
wish
to
see
her
more
often
but
along
with
that
always
became
illhumored
when
she
spoke
of
her
nikolai
tried
to
say
nothing
when
his
mother
spoke
of
the
princess
but
his
silence
vexed
the
countess
shes
a
very
worthy
and
wonderful
girl
she
said
and
you
must
call
on
her
at
least
youll
see
someone
because
i
think
youre
bored
with
us
but
i
dont
have
the
slightest
wish
to
mama
first
you
wanted
to
see
her
but
now
i
dont
wish
to
i
really
dont
understand
you
my
dear
first
youre
bored
then
you
suddenly
dont
want
to
see
anybody
i
never
said
i
was
bored
why
you
yourself
said
you
dont
even
wish
to
see
her
shes
a
very
worthy
girl
and
you
always
liked
her
but
now
there
are
suddenly
some
sort
of
reasons
you
hide
everything
from
me
not
at
all
mama
if
i
was
asking
you
to
do
something
unpleasant
but
all
im
asking
is
that
you
go
and
return
a
visit
it
would
seem
that
courtesy
demands
itive
asked
you
and
now
i
wont
interfere
anymore
since
you
have
secrets
from
your
mother
ill
go
then
if
you
want
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
i
want
it
for
your
sake
nikolai
sighed
bit
his
mustache
and
laid
out
the
cards
trying
to
divert
his
mothers
attention
to
another
subject
the
next
day
and
the
third
and
the
fourth
the
same
conversation
was
repeated
after
her
visit
to
the
rostovs
and
the
unexpected
cold
reception
she
was
given
by
nikolai
princess
marya
confessed
to
herself
that
she
had
been
right
in
not
wishing
to
go
first
to
the
rostovs
i
expected
nothing
else
she
said
to
herself
calling
on
her
pride
for
help
i
dont
care
about
him
at
all
i
merely
wanted
to
see
the
old
lady
who
was
always
kind
to
me
and
to
whom
i
owe
a
great
deal
but
she
could
not
pacify
herself
with
these
arguments
a
feeling
akin
to
repentance
tormented
her
when
she
remembered
her
visit
though
she
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
call
on
the
rostovs
anymore
and
to
forget
it
all
she
constantly
felt
herself
in
an
uncertain
position
and
when
she
asked
herself
what
it
was
that
tormented
her
she
had
to
confess
that
it
was
her
relations
with
rostov
his
cold
courteous
tone
did
not
come
from
his
feeling
for
her
she
knew
that
but
was
covering
up
something
that
something
she
had
to
explain
and
until
then
she
felt
she
could
not
be
at
peace
in
the
middle
of
winter
she
was
sitting
in
the
schoolroom
following
her
nephews
lessons
when
rostovs
arrival
was
announced
firmly
resolved
not
to
give
away
her
secret
and
not
to
show
her
confusion
she
called
mlle
bourienne
and
together
with
her
came
out
to
the
drawing
room
with
the
first
glance
at
nikolais
face
she
saw
that
he
had
come
only
to
fulfill
his
duty
to
courtesy
and
she
resolved
to
keep
firmly
to
the
same
tone
in
which
he
addressed
her
they
talked
about
the
countesss
health
about
mutual
acquaintances
about
the
latest
news
of
the
war
and
when
the
ten
minutes
demanded
by
decency
had
passed
after
which
a
guest
may
rise
nikolai
stood
up
to
say
goodbye
the
princess
with
the
help
of
mlle
bourienne
had
sustained
the
conversation
very
well
but
at
the
very
last
moment
just
as
he
stood
up
she
felt
so
tired
of
talking
about
things
of
no
concern
to
her
and
the
thought
that
she
alone
was
given
so
few
joys
in
life
occupied
her
so
much
that
in
a
fit
of
absentmindednes
her
luminous
eyes
staring
straight
ahead
she
sat
motionless
not
noticing
that
he
had
stood
up
nikolai
looked
at
her
and
wishing
to
make
it
seem
that
he
did
not
notice
her
absentmindedness
said
a
few
words
to
mlle
bourienne
and
again
glanced
at
the
princess
she
was
sitting
just
as
motionless
and
her
tender
face
expressed
suffering
he
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
her
and
vaguely
imagined
that
he
might
be
the
cause
of
the
sorrow
expressed
on
her
face
he
would
have
liked
to
help
her
to
say
something
nice
to
her
but
he
could
not
think
of
what
to
say
goodbye
princess
he
said
she
came
to
her
senses
blushed
and
sighed
deeply
ah
forgive
me
she
said
as
if
waking
up
youre
leaving
already
count
well
goodbye
what
about
the
pillow
for
the
countess
wait
ill
bring
it
at
once
said
mlle
bourienne
and
she
left
the
room
they
were
both
silent
glancing
at
each
other
from
time
to
time
yes
princess
nikolai
finally
said
smiling
sadly
it
doesnt
seem
long
ago
but
so
much
water
has
flowed
by
since
you
and
i
met
for
the
first
time
in
bogucharovo
how
unfortunate
we
all
seemedyet
id
pay
dearly
to
bring
that
time
backbut
theres
no
bringing
it
back
the
princess
was
looking
intently
into
his
eyes
with
her
luminous
gaze
while
he
said
that
it
was
as
if
she
were
trying
to
grasp
the
hidden
meaning
of
his
words
which
would
explain
to
her
his
feeling
for
her
yes
yes
she
said
but
you
shouldnt
regret
the
past
count
as
i
understand
your
life
now
youll
always
remember
it
with
pleasure
because
the
selfsacrifice
by
which
you
live
now
i
do
not
accept
your
praises
he
hastily
interrupted
her
on
the
contrary
i
constantly
reproach
myself
but
that
is
a
quite
uninteresting
and
cheerless
subject
and
again
his
eyes
acquired
their
former
dry
and
cold
expression
but
the
princess
had
already
seen
in
him
the
same
man
she
had
known
and
loved
and
she
now
spoke
only
with
that
man
i
thought
you
would
allow
me
to
say
that
to
you
she
said
i
had
become
so
close
to
youand
to
your
family
and
i
thought
you
would
not
consider
my
sympathy
misplaced
but
i
was
mistaken
she
said
her
voice
suddenly
quavered
i
dont
know
why
she
went
on
having
composed
herself
you
were
different
before
and
there
are
thousands
of
reasons
why
he
placed
special
emphasis
on
the
word
why
thank
you
princess
he
said
softly
its
sometimes
hard
so
thats
why
thats
why
an
inner
voice
was
saying
in
princess
maryas
soul
no
it
wasnt
only
that
cheerful
kind
and
open
gaze
not
only
that
handsome
appearance
that
i
loved
in
him
i
guessed
at
his
noble
firm
selfsacrificing
soul
she
said
to
herself
yes
hes
poor
now
and
im
richyes
its
only
because
of
thatyes
if
it
werent
for
that
and
recalling
his
former
tenderness
and
looking
now
at
his
kind
and
sad
face
she
suddenly
understood
the
reason
for
his
coldness
but
why
count
why
she
suddenly
almost
cried
out
involuntarily
moving
towards
him
why
tell
me
you
must
tell
me
he
was
silent
i
dont
know
your
why
count
she
went
on
but
its
hard
for
me
itsill
confess
it
to
you
you
want
for
some
reason
to
deprive
me
of
your
former
friendship
and
that
pains
me
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
voice
there
has
been
so
little
happiness
in
my
life
that
every
loss
is
hard
for
meforgive
me
goodbye
she
suddenly
began
to
weep
and
started
out
of
the
room
princess
wait
for
gods
sake
he
cried
trying
to
stop
her
princess
she
glanced
back
for
a
few
seconds
they
looked
silently
into
each
others
eyes
and
the
distant
and
impossible
suddenly
became
near
possible
and
inevitable
vii
in
the
fall
of
1814
nikolai
married
princess
marya
and
moved
with
his
wife
mother
and
sonya
to
live
at
bald
hills
in
three
years
without
selling
his
wifes
estate
he
paid
off
the
remaining
debts
and
having
received
a
small
inheritance
from
a
deceased
cousin
also
paid
back
his
debt
to
pierre
in
three
more
years
by
1820
nikolai
had
so
arranged
his
financial
affairs
that
he
bought
another
small
estate
near
bald
hills
and
was
negotiating
to
buy
back
his
fathers
otradnoe
which
was
his
fondest
dream
having
begun
farming
out
of
necessity
he
quickly
developed
such
a
passion
for
it
that
it
became
his
favorite
and
almost
sole
occupation
nikolai
was
a
simple
farmer
did
not
like
innovations
especially
the
english
ones
which
were
becoming
fashionable
then
laughed
at
theoretical
writings
on
farming
did
not
like
millworks
expensive
products
expensive
cereal
crops
and
generally
was
not
taken
up
with
any
specific
farming
before
his
eyes
there
was
always
only
the
estate
as
a
whole
and
not
some
separate
it
and
the
chief
thing
on
the
estate
was
not
nitrogen
and
not
oxygen
which
were
in
the
soil
or
the
air
not
a
special
plow
and
manure
but
the
chief
tool
by
means
of
which
nitrogen
and
oxygen
and
manure
and
the
plow
became
operativethat
is
the
laboring
muzhik
when
nikolai
took
up
farming
and
began
going
into
its
various
parts
his
attention
was
especially
drawn
to
the
muzhik
the
muzhik
appeared
to
him
not
only
as
a
tool
but
as
a
goal
and
a
judge
he
began
by
studying
the
muzhik
trying
to
understand
what
he
wanted
what
he
considered
bad
or
good
and
only
pretended
to
give
instructions
and
orders
but
in
essence
was
only
learning
the
methods
and
speech
of
the
muzhiks
and
their
judgments
of
what
was
good
and
what
was
bad
and
only
when
he
understood
the
tastes
and
strivings
of
the
muzhik
learned
to
speak
his
language
and
understand
the
hidden
meaning
of
his
speech
when
he
felt
akin
to
him
only
then
did
he
begin
boldly
to
manage
him
that
is
to
fulfill
in
relation
to
the
muzhiks
that
very
duty
the
fulfillment
of
which
was
demanded
of
him
and
nikolais
farming
produced
the
most
brilliant
results
on
taking
up
the
management
of
the
estate
nikolai
at
once
unerringly
by
some
gift
of
insight
appointed
as
bailiff
headman
and
delegate
the
very
people
who
would
have
been
chosen
by
the
muzhiks
themselves
if
it
had
been
up
to
them
and
his
officers
never
changed
before
studying
the
chemical
properties
of
manure
before
getting
involved
with
debit
and
credit
as
he
liked
to
say
mockingly
he
found
out
the
number
of
cattle
the
peasants
had
and
increased
that
number
by
every
possible
means
he
maintained
peasant
families
of
the
largest
size
not
allowing
them
to
divide
up
the
lazy
the
depraved
and
the
weak
he
persecuted
equally
and
tried
to
drive
them
out
of
the
community
during
the
sowing
and
harvesting
of
hay
and
grain
he
looked
after
his
own
and
the
muzhiks
fields
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
rare
was
the
landowner
who
had
his
fields
sown
and
harvested
so
early
and
so
well
and
had
such
good
returns
as
nikolai
he
did
not
like
having
anything
to
do
with
house
serfs
called
them
freeloaders
and
as
everyone
said
spoiled
and
indulged
them
when
some
sort
of
orders
had
to
be
given
about
a
house
serf
especially
when
one
had
to
be
punished
he
would
lapse
into
indecisiveness
and
consult
everyone
in
the
house
but
when
it
was
possible
to
send
a
house
serf
as
a
soldier
in
place
of
a
muzhik
he
did
it
without
the
slightest
hesitation
in
all
his
orders
concerning
muzhiks
he
never
experienced
the
slightest
doubt
any
order
from
himthis
he
knewwould
be
approved
by
all
against
one
or
a
few
he
never
allowed
himself
either
to
burden
or
punish
a
man
only
because
he
wanted
it
that
way
or
to
relieve
and
reward
a
man
because
it
was
his
personal
desire
to
do
so
he
would
have
been
unable
to
say
what
constituted
this
yardstick
of
what
should
and
should
not
be
done
but
this
yardstick
in
his
soul
was
firm
and
unwavering
he
often
said
with
vexation
of
some
failure
or
disorder
thats
our
russian
folkand
fancied
that
he
could
not
bear
muzhiks
but
with
all
the
forces
of
his
soul
he
loved
these
russian
folk
and
their
life
and
only
because
of
that
understood
and
adopted
for
himself
the
one
way
and
method
of
farming
that
produced
good
results
countess
marya
was
jealous
of
this
love
of
her
husbands
and
was
sorry
that
she
could
not
share
in
it
but
she
could
not
understand
the
joys
and
griefs
afforded
him
by
that
separate
world
so
foreign
to
her
she
could
not
understand
why
he
was
so
especially
animated
and
happy
when
having
gotten
up
at
dawn
and
spent
the
whole
morning
in
the
fields
or
at
the
threshing
floor
he
came
back
to
have
tea
with
her
from
the
sowing
mowing
or
harvesting
she
did
not
understand
why
he
told
her
admiringly
and
with
rapture
about
the
rich
thrifty
muzhik
matvei
ermishin
who
spent
whole
nights
with
his
family
transporting
sheaves
and
before
anyone
else
had
anything
harvested
already
had
his
stacks
built
she
did
not
understand
why
pacing
from
the
window
to
the
balcony
he
smiled
so
joyfully
under
his
mustache
and
winked
to
himself
when
a
warm
fine
rain
fell
on
the
withering
oat
sprouts
or
why
when
a
menacing
cloud
was
blown
away
during
the
mowing
or
harvesting
he
would
come
from
the
threshing
floor
red
sunburnt
and
sweaty
with
the
smell
of
wormwood
and
bitterwort
in
his
hair
joyfully
rubbing
his
hands
and
say
well
one
more
little
day
and
mine
and
the
peasants
will
all
be
threshed
still
less
could
she
understand
why
he
with
his
kind
heart
with
his
usual
readiness
to
anticipate
her
wishes
would
almost
be
driven
to
despair
when
she
conveyed
to
him
the
requests
of
some
peasant
women
or
muzhiks
who
had
turned
to
her
asking
to
be
released
from
work
why
he
her
kind
nicolas
stubbornly
refused
her
angrily
asking
her
not
to
interfere
in
what
was
not
her
business
she
felt
that
he
had
his
special
world
which
he
passionately
loved
with
some
sort
of
laws
that
she
did
not
understand
when
trying
to
understand
him
she
occasionally
spoke
to
him
of
his
merits
which
consisted
in
being
good
to
his
subjects
he
would
get
angry
and
say
not
in
the
least
it
never
even
enters
my
head
and
i
wouldnt
do
this
much
for
their
good
its
all
poetry
and
old
wives
talesall
this
good
of
ones
neighbor
i
want
our
children
not
to
go
begging
i
have
to
set
up
our
fortune
while
i
live
thats
all
whats
needed
for
that
is
order
strictnessthats
what
he
said
clenching
his
sanguine
fist
and
justice
of
course
he
added
because
if
a
peasant
is
naked
and
hungry
and
has
only
one
little
nag
he
wont
work
well
either
for
himself
or
for
me
andit
must
have
been
because
nikolai
did
not
allow
himself
the
thought
that
he
was
doing
anything
for
others
out
of
virtuousnessall
that
he
did
was
fruitful
his
fortune
quickly
increased
neighboring
muzhiks
came
asking
him
to
buy
them
and
long
after
his
death
the
pious
memory
of
his
management
was
preserved
among
the
people
he
was
a
masterthe
muzhiks
affairs
first
and
then
his
own
but
he
never
went
easy
on
us
in
shorta
master
viii
the
one
thing
that
tormented
nikolai
in
his
running
of
the
estate
was
his
hot
temper
combined
with
the
old
hussar
habit
of
making
free
with
his
fists
at
first
he
saw
nothing
reprehensible
in
it
but
in
the
second
year
of
his
marriage
his
view
of
this
sort
of
reprisal
suddenly
changed
once
in
the
summer
the
headman
from
bogucharovo
was
summoned
the
one
who
had
replaced
the
late
dron
and
who
was
accused
of
various
frauds
and
irregularities
nikolai
came
out
to
him
on
the
porch
and
with
the
headmans
first
answers
shouts
and
blows
could
be
heard
in
the
front
hall
returning
home
for
lunch
nikolai
went
up
to
his
wife
who
was
sitting
with
her
head
bent
low
over
her
embroidery
and
began
telling
her
as
usual
everything
he
had
been
busy
with
that
morning
and
incidentally
about
the
bogucharovo
headman
countess
marya
turning
red
then
pale
and
pursing
her
lips
sat
in
the
same
way
her
head
bowed
and
made
no
reply
to
her
husbands
words
such
an
impudent
scoundrel
he
said
getting
angry
at
the
mere
recollection
he
could
have
told
me
he
was
drunk
didnt
seewhats
wrong
marie
he
suddenly
asked
countess
marya
raised
her
head
was
about
to
say
something
then
quickly
looked
down
again
and
pressed
her
lips
what
is
it
whats
wrong
my
dearest
the
homely
countess
marya
always
became
pretty
when
she
wept
she
never
wept
from
pain
or
vexation
but
always
from
sadness
and
pity
and
when
she
wept
her
luminous
eyes
became
irresistibly
lovely
as
soon
as
nikolai
took
her
hand
she
was
unable
to
restrain
herself
and
began
to
weep
nicolas
i
sawhe
was
wrong
but
you
why
did
you
nicolas
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
nikolai
fell
silent
blushed
deeply
and
moving
away
from
her
silently
began
pacing
the
room
he
understood
what
she
was
weeping
about
but
in
his
soul
he
could
not
suddenly
agree
with
her
that
something
he
had
lived
with
since
childhood
and
considered
most
ordinarywas
bad
is
this
gentilities
old
wives
tales
or
is
she
right
he
asked
himself
without
deciding
the
question
for
himself
he
glanced
once
again
at
her
suffering
and
loving
face
and
suddenly
understood
that
she
was
right
and
he
had
long
been
in
the
wrong
with
himself
marie
he
said
softly
going
up
to
her
it
will
never
happen
again
i
give
you
my
word
never
he
repeated
in
a
quavering
voice
like
a
boy
asking
forgiveness
the
tears
flowed
still
more
abundantly
from
the
countesss
eyes
she
took
her
husbands
hand
and
kissed
it
nicolas
when
did
you
break
the
cameo
she
said
to
change
the
subject
studying
his
hand
on
which
there
was
a
signet
ring
with
the
head
of
laoco246n
today
all
that
same
thing
ah
marie
dont
remind
me
of
it
he
blushed
deeply
again
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
it
wont
happen
again
and
let
this
always
remind
me
of
it
he
said
pointing
to
the
broken
ring
from
then
on
in
talking
with
headmen
and
stewards
the
moment
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
his
hands
began
clenching
into
fists
nikolai
turned
the
broken
ring
on
his
finger
and
lowered
his
eyes
before
the
man
who
had
angered
him
however
about
twice
a
year
he
would
forget
himself
and
would
then
come
to
his
wife
confess
and
again
promise
her
that
this
was
now
the
very
last
time
marie
you
surely
despise
me
he
would
say
to
her
i
deserve
it
you
should
walk
away
walk
away
quickly
if
you
feel
you
cant
control
yourself
countess
marya
would
say
with
sadness
trying
to
comfort
her
husband
among
the
gentry
of
the
province
nikolai
was
respected
but
not
liked
he
was
not
concerned
with
the
interests
of
the
gentry
and
for
that
some
regarded
him
as
a
proud
others
as
a
stupid
man
all
his
time
in
the
summer
from
the
spring
sowing
to
the
harvest
was
spent
on
farm
work
in
the
fall
with
the
same
businesslike
seriousness
with
which
he
occupied
himself
with
farming
he
gave
himself
to
hunting
going
off
for
a
month
or
two
with
his
hunt
in
winter
he
rode
around
to
his
other
estates
and
took
up
reading
his
reading
consisted
mostly
of
history
books
which
he
ordered
each
year
for
a
certain
sum
he
was
putting
together
as
he
said
a
serious
library
and
made
it
a
rule
to
read
all
the
books
he
bought
he
would
sit
in
his
study
with
an
important
look
over
this
reading
which
was
first
selfimposed
as
a
duty
but
later
became
a
habitual
occupation
that
provided
him
with
a
special
sort
of
pleasure
and
the
awareness
of
being
occupied
with
a
serious
matter
except
for
business
trips
he
spent
the
greater
the
time
in
winter
at
home
sharing
the
life
of
his
family
and
entering
into
the
minute
relations
between
mother
and
children
he
became
closer
and
closer
with
his
wife
every
day
discovering
new
spiritual
treasures
in
her
from
the
time
of
nikolais
marriage
sonya
had
been
living
in
his
house
before
his
marriage
blaming
himself
and
praising
her
nikolai
had
told
his
fianc233e
everything
that
there
had
been
between
him
and
sonya
he
had
asked
princess
marya
to
be
gentle
and
kind
with
his
cousin
countess
marya
felt
the
full
guilt
of
her
husband
she
also
felt
her
own
guilt
before
sonya
she
thought
that
her
fortune
had
influenced
nikolais
choice
could
not
reproach
sonya
for
anything
wished
to
love
her
but
not
only
did
not
love
her
but
often
found
wicked
feelings
against
her
in
her
heart
and
could
not
overcome
them
once
she
got
to
talking
with
her
friend
natasha
about
sonya
and
about
her
unfairness
towards
her
you
know
what
said
natasha
youve
read
the
gospels
a
great
deal
theres
a
passage
in
them
thats
exactly
about
sonya
what
countess
marya
asked
in
astonishment
to
him
who
has
will
be
given
from
him
who
has
not
will
be
taken
remember
shes
the
one
who
has
notwhy
i
dont
know
maybe
she
lacks
egoismi
dont
know
but
from
her
will
be
taken
and
everything
has
been
taken
i
feel
terribly
sorry
for
her
sometimes
i
used
to
want
terribly
for
nicolas
to
marry
her
but
i
always
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
it
would
never
be
shes
a
sterile
blossom
you
know
like
on
strawberries
sometimes
i
feel
sorry
for
her
but
sometimes
i
think
she
doesnt
feel
it
the
way
we
would
and
though
countess
marya
explained
to
natasha
that
those
words
of
the
gospel
should
be
understood
differentlylooking
at
sonya
she
agreed
with
the
explanation
given
by
natasha
indeed
it
did
seem
that
sonya
was
not
burdened
by
her
position
and
was
completely
reconciled
with
her
destiny
as
a
sterile
blossom
it
seemed
she
valued
not
so
much
the
people
as
the
whole
family
like
a
cat
she
became
accustomed
not
to
the
people
but
to
the
house
she
took
care
of
the
old
countess
petted
and
pampered
the
children
was
always
ready
to
render
the
small
services
she
was
capable
of
but
all
this
was
involuntarily
taken
with
far
too
little
gratitude
the
country
seat
at
bald
hills
had
been
rebuilt
but
no
longer
on
the
footing
it
had
been
on
under
the
late
prince
the
buildings
begun
in
the
lean
time
were
more
than
simple
the
enormous
house
on
the
old
stone
foundations
was
built
of
wood
and
plastered
only
inside
the
big
roomy
house
with
its
bare
plank
floors
was
furnished
with
the
simplest
hard
sofas
and
armchairs
tables
and
chairs
fashioned
from
their
own
birches
by
their
own
joiners
the
house
was
spacious
with
rooms
for
the
servants
and
separate
quarters
for
visitors
the
relations
of
the
rostovs
and
bolkonskys
sometimes
descended
on
bald
hills
by
whole
families
with
their
sixteen
horses
with
dozens
of
servants
and
stayed
for
months
besides
that
four
times
a
year
on
the
masters
birthdays
and
name
days
up
to
a
hundred
guests
would
gather
for
a
day
or
two
for
the
rest
of
the
year
an
inviolably
regular
life
went
on
with
its
usual
occupations
teas
lunches
dinners
and
suppers
from
the
households
provisions
ix
it
was
the
eve
of
the
winter
feast
of
st
nicholas
the
fifth
of
december
1820
that
year
natasha
her
children
and
husband
had
been
visiting
with
her
brother
since
the
early
fall
pierre
was
in
petersburg
where
he
had
gone
on
his
own
special
business
as
he
put
it
for
three
weeks
and
had
already
stayed
for
seven
he
was
expected
any
moment
on
the
fifth
of
december
besides
the
bezukhov
family
nikolais
old
friend
retired
general
vassily
fyodorovich
denisov
also
visited
the
rostovs
on
the
sixth
the
feast
day
when
guests
would
gather
nikolai
knew
he
would
have
to
take
off
his
quilted
jacket
put
on
a
frock
coat
and
narrow
boots
with
narrow
toes
and
go
to
the
new
church
he
had
built
and
then
receive
congratulations
serve
refreshments
and
talk
about
the
election
of
the
marshal
of
nobility
and
about
the
harvest
but
he
still
considered
it
his
right
to
spend
the
eve
of
the
day
as
usual
before
dinner
nikolai
went
through
the
bailiffs
accounts
from
the
ryazan
village
the
estate
of
his
wifes
nephew
wrote
two
business
letters
and
strolled
to
the
threshing
floor
the
cattle
and
horse
yards
having
taken
measures
against
the
general
drunkenness
expected
the
next
day
on
the
occasion
of
the
patron
saints
feast
he
came
to
dinner
and
having
no
time
for
a
private
talk
with
his
wife
sat
down
at
the
long
table
set
for
twenty
at
which
the
whole
household
was
gathered
at
the
table
were
his
mother
the
old
mrs
belov
who
lived
with
her
his
wife
his
three
children
the
governess
the
tutor
his
nephew
with
his
tutor
sonya
denisov
natasha
her
three
children
their
governess
and
old
mikhail
ivanych
the
princes
architect
who
was
living
in
retirement
at
bald
hills
countess
marya
sat
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
as
soon
as
her
husband
sat
in
his
place
by
the
gesture
with
which
having
removed
the
napkin
he
quickly
shifted
the
goblet
and
wineglass
that
stood
in
front
of
him
countess
marya
decided
that
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
as
sometimes
happened
to
him
especially
before
the
soup
and
when
he
had
come
to
dinner
straight
from
farmwork
countess
marya
knew
that
mood
very
well
and
when
she
was
in
a
good
mood
herself
she
calmly
waited
until
he
had
had
his
soup
and
only
then
began
to
talk
to
him
and
make
him
admit
that
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
for
no
reason
but
today
she
completely
forgot
this
observation
of
hers
it
pained
her
that
he
was
angry
with
her
for
no
reason
and
she
felt
unhappy
she
asked
him
where
he
had
been
he
told
her
she
also
asked
whether
everything
was
all
right
on
the
farm
he
winced
unpleasantly
from
her
unnatural
tone
and
answered
brusquely
so
i
wasnt
mistaken
thought
countess
marya
why
is
he
angry
with
me
in
the
tone
of
his
answer
countess
marya
heard
ill
will
towards
her
and
a
wish
to
break
off
the
conversation
she
felt
that
her
words
were
unnatural
but
she
could
not
keep
from
asking
several
more
questions
thanks
to
denisov
the
conversation
at
dinner
soon
became
general
and
lively
and
countess
marya
did
not
talk
to
her
husband
when
they
left
the
table
and
went
to
thank
the
old
countess
countess
marya
kissed
her
husband
holding
out
her
hand
and
asked
him
why
he
was
angry
with
her
you
always
have
the
strangest
notions
i
never
thought
of
being
angry
he
said
but
the
word
always
answered
countess
marya
yes
im
angry
and
i
dont
want
to
say
so
nikolai
and
his
wife
got
along
so
well
that
even
sonya
and
the
old
countess
who
out
of
jealousy
wished
for
some
disagreement
between
them
could
find
no
pretext
for
reproach
but
there
were
also
moments
of
hostility
between
them
sometimes
precisely
after
the
happiest
periods
a
feeling
of
estrangement
and
hostility
suddenly
came
over
them
this
feeling
appeared
most
often
at
the
time
of
countess
maryas
pregnancies
she
was
in
one
of
those
periods
now
well
messieurs
et
mesdames
nikolai
said
loudly
and
as
if
merrily
countess
marya
fancied
it
was
deliberate
so
as
to
offend
her
ive
been
on
my
feet
since
six
oclock
tomorrow
ill
have
to
suffer
but
today
ill
go
and
rest
and
without
saying
anything
more
to
countess
marya
he
went
to
the
small
sitting
room
and
lay
on
the
sofa
thats
how
it
always
is
thought
countess
marya
he
talks
with
everybody
except
me
i
see
i
see
he
finds
me
repulsive
especially
in
this
condition
she
looked
at
her
high
stomach
and
in
the
mirror
at
her
yellow
pale
emaciated
face
its
big
eyes
bigger
than
ever
and
everything
became
unpleasant
for
her
denisovs
shouting
and
laughing
and
natashas
talking
and
especially
the
glance
that
sonya
hastily
cast
at
her
sonya
was
always
the
first
pretext
that
countess
marya
chose
for
her
irritation
having
sat
with
the
guests
and
understood
nothing
of
what
they
were
saying
she
quietly
stepped
out
and
went
to
the
nursery
the
children
were
riding
to
moscow
on
chairs
and
invited
her
to
come
with
them
she
sat
down
and
played
with
them
but
the
thought
of
her
husband
and
his
groundless
vexation
never
stopped
tormenting
her
she
got
up
and
tiptoeing
with
difficulty
went
to
the
small
sitting
room
maybe
hes
not
asleep
ill
have
a
talk
with
him
she
said
to
herself
andryusha
the
elder
boy
imitating
her
came
after
her
on
tiptoe
countess
marya
did
not
notice
him
ch232re
marie
il
dort

crois

est
si
fatigu233
said
sonya
it
seemed
to
countess
marya
that
she
met
her
everywhere
in
the
big
sitting
room
andryusha
may
wake
him
up
countess
marya
turned
saw
andryusha
behind
her
felt
that
sonya
was
right
and
precisely
because
of
that
flared
up
and
clearly
had
difficulty
holding
back
a
harsh
word
she
said
nothing
and
so
as
not
to
obey
sonya
made
a
sign
with
her
hand
for
andryusha
not
to
make
noise
but
still
to
follow
her
and
went
to
the
door
sonya
left
by
the
other
door
from
the
room
where
nikolai
was
sleeping
his
wife
could
hear
his
regular
breathing
familiar
to
her
down
to
the
smallest
nuances
hearing
that
breathing
she
saw
before
her
his
smooth
handsome
forehead
his
mustache
his
whole
face
which
she
so
often
gazed
at
for
a
long
time
while
he
slept
in
the
silence
of
the
night
nikolai
suddenly
stirred
and
grunted
and
at
the
same
time
andryusha
shouted
through
the
door
papa
mamas
standing
here
countess
marya
turned
pale
from
fright
and
began
making
signs
to
her
son
he
fell
silent
and
this
silence
so
terrible
for
countess
marya
went
on
for
about
a
minute
she
knew
how
much
nikolai
disliked
being
awakened
suddenly
from
behind
the
door
came
a
new
grunt
movement
and
the
displeased
voice
of
nikolai
said
they
dont
give
me
a
moments
peace
marie
is
that
you
why
have
you
brought
him
here
i
only
came
to
look
i
didnt
seeexcuse
me
nikolai
cleared
his
throat
and
fell
silent
countess
marya
stepped
away
from
the
door
and
took
her
son
to
the
nursery
five
minutes
later
unnoticed
by
her
mother
the
threeyearold
darkeyed
little
natasha
her
fathers
favorite
having
learned
from
her
brother
that
papa
was
sleeping
in
mamas
sitting
room
ran
to
her
father
the
darkeyed
little
girl
boldly
opened
the
creaking
door
went
up
to
the
sofa
stepping
energetically
on
her
blunt
little
feet
and
making
out
the
position
of
her
father
who
was
sleeping
with
his
back
to
her
got
up
on
tiptoe
and
kissed
his
hand
which
lay
under
his
head
nikolai
turned
with
a
tender
smile
on
his
face
natasha
natasha
countess
maryas
frightened
whisper
was
heard
through
the
door
papa

to
sleep
no
mama
he
doesnt
want
to

little
natasha
answered
with
conviction
hes
laughing
nikolai
lowered
his
feet
sat
up
and
took
his
daughter
in
his
arms
come

masha
he
said
to
his
wife
countess
marya
went
in
and
sat
down
by
her
husband
i
didnt
see
him
run
after
me
she
said
timidly
im
so
nikolai
holding
his
daughter
with
one
arm
glanced
at
his
wife
and
noticing
the
guilty
expression
on
her
face
put
his
other
arm
around
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
hair
may
i
kiss
mam224
he
asked
natasha
natasha
smiled
shyly
again
she
said
pointing
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
the
place
where
nikolai
had
kissed
his
wife
i
dont
know
why
you
think
im
in
a
bad
humor
said
nikolai
answering
the
question
that
he
knew
was
in
his
wifes
mind
you
cant
imagine
how
unhappy
and
lonely
i
am
when
youre
like
that
it
always
seems
to
me
enough
silliness
marie
shame
on
you
he
said
gaily
it
seems
to
me
that
you
cant
love
me
because

so
plainalwaysand

this
cond
ah

but
i

so
youre
not
angry
with
me
terribly
angry
he
said
smiling
and
standing
up
and
smoothing
his
hair
he
started
pacing
the
room
do
you
know
what
i
was
thinking
about
marie
he
began
now
that
they
were
reconciled
beginning
at
once
to
think
aloud
in
his
wifes
presence
he
did
not
ask
whether
she
was
prepared
to
listen
to
him
it
made
no
difference
to
him
the
thought
had
occurred
to
him
which
meant
to
her
too
and
he
told
her
of
his
intention
to
persuade
pierre
to
stay
with
them
until
spring
countess
marya
heard
him
out
made
her
comments
and
in
turn
began
to
think
her
thoughts
aloud
her
thoughts
were
about
the
children
how
one
sees
the
woman
in
her
even
now
she
said
in
french
pointing
to
natasha
you
reproach
us
women
for
being
illogical
heres
our
logic
i
say
to
her
papa
wants
to
sleep
and
she
says
no
hes
laughing
and
shes
right
said
countess
marya
smiling
happily
yes
yes
and
nikolai
taking
his
daughter
in
his
strong
hands
lifted
her
up
seated
her
on
his
shoulder
and
holding
her
legs
began
walking
about
the
room
with
her
both
father
and
daughter
had
the
same
senselessly
happy
faces
but
you
know
maybe
youre
unfair
you
love
this
one
too
much
countess
marya
whispered
in
french
yes
but
what
can
i
doi
try
not
to
show
it
just
then
the
sounds
of
the
door
pulley
and
footsteps
came
from
the
front
hall
and
anteroom
like
the
sounds
of
an
arrival
someones
come
im
certain
its
pierre
ill
go
and
find
out
said
countess
marya
and
she
went
out
of
the
room
in
her
absence
nikolai
allowed
himself
to
give
his
daughter
a
gallop
around
the
room
out
of
breath
he
quickly
set
down
the
laughing
girl
and
hugged
her
to
his
breast
his
leaps
reminded
him
of
dancing
and
looking
at
the
childs
round
happy
face
he
thought
of
how
she
would
be
when
he
as
an
old
man
started
taking
her
out
and
would
do
the
mazurka
with
her
as
his
late
father
used
to
dance
the
daniel
cooper
with
his
daughter
its
him
its
him
nicolas
countess
marya
said
a
few
minutes
later
coming
back
into
the
room
now
our
natashas
revived
you
should
have
seen
her
delight
and
how
he
got
it
from
her
for
overstaying
well
come
along
come
along
quickly
do
part
finally
she
said
smiling
looking
at
the
little
girl
who
pressed
herself
to
her
father
nikolai
went
out
holding
his
daughter
by
the
hand
countess
marya
stayed
in
the
sitting
room
never
never
would
i
have
believed
she
whispered
to
herself
that
one
could
be
so
happy
her
face
shone
with
a
smile
but
at
the
same
time
she
sighed
and
her
profound
gaze
showed
a
quiet
sadness
as
if
besides
the
happiness
she
experienced
there
was
another
happiness
unattainable
in
this
life
which
she
involuntarily
remembered
at
that
moment
x
natasha
was
married
in
the
early
spring
of
1813
and
by
1820
she
already
had
three
daughters
and
one
son
whom
she
had
passionately
wished
for
and
was
now
nursing
herself
she
had
filled
out
and
broadened
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
recognize
in
this
strong
mother
the
former
slender
nimble
natasha
the
features
of
her
face
had
defined
themselves
and
bore
an
expression
of
softness
and
serenity
in
her
face
there
was
not
as
formerly
that
ceaselessly
burning
fire
of
animation
that
had
constituted
her
charm
now
one
often
saw
only
her
face
and
body
while
her
soul
was
not
seen
at
all
one
saw
only
a
strong
beautiful
and
fruitful
female
very
rarely
was
the
former
fire
kindled
in
her
now
it
happened
only
when
as
now
her
husband
returned
home
or
a
sick
child
recovered
or
she
and
countess
marya
remembered
prince
andrei
she
never
spoke
of
him
with
her
husband
supposing
that
he
was
jealous
of
prince
andreis
memory
and
very
rarely
when
something
chanced
to
draw
her
into
singing
which
she
had
abandoned
completely
after
marriage
and
in
those
rare
moments
when
the
former
fire
was
kindled
in
her
developed
beautiful
body
she
was
still
more
attractive
than
before
since
the
time
of
her
marriage
natasha
and
her
husband
had
lived
in
moscow
petersburg
on
the
estate
near
moscow
and
with
her
mother
that
is
with
nikolai
the
young
countess
bezukhov
was
little
seen
in
society
and
those
who
saw
her
remained
displeased
she
was
neither
sweet
nor
amiable
it
was
not
that
natasha
liked
solitude
she
did
not
know
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
it
even
seemed
to
her
that
she
did
not
but
bearing
giving
birth
to
and
nursing
her
children
and
taking
every
minute
of
her
husbands
life
she
was
unable
to
satisfy
those
needs
otherwise
than
by
giving
up
society
everyone
who
had
known
natasha
before
her
marriage
was
surprised
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
as
at
something
extraordinary
only
the
old
countess
with
her
mothers
intuition
understood
that
all
natashas
impulses
came
only
from
the
need
to
have
a
family
to
have
a
husband
as
she
not
so
much
joking
as
in
earnest
had
cried
out
once
in
otradnoe
her
mother
was
surprised
at
the
surprise
of
the
people
who
did
not
understand
natasha
and
kept
repeating
that
she
had
always
known
that
natasha
would
make
an
exemplary
wife
and
mother
only
she
carries
her
love
for
her
husband
and
children
to
such
an
extreme
said
the
countess
that
its
even
stupid
natasha
did
not
follow
that
golden
rule
preached
by
intelligent
people
especially
the
french
according
to
which
a
girl
once
married
should
not
let
herself
go
should
not
abandon
her
talents
should
be
still
more
concerned
with
her
appearance
than
when
unmarried
should
entice
her
husband
just
as
she
had
enticed
him
before
he
was
her
husband
natasha
on
the
contrary
at
once
abandoned
all
her
charms
among
which
one
was
extraordinarily
strongher
singing
she
abandoned
it
precisely
because
it
was
a
strong
charm
she
as
they
put
it
let
herself
go
natasha
took
no
trouble
either
about
her
manners
or
about
the
delicacy
of
her
speech
or
about
showing
herself
to
her
husband
in
the
most
advantageous
poses
or
about
her
toilette
or
about
not
hampering
her
husband
with
her
demands
she
did
everything
contrary
to
these
rules
she
felt
that
the
charms
which
her
instinct
had
taught
her
to
make
use
of
before
would
now
only
be
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
her
husband
to
whom
from
the
first
moment
she
had
given
herself
entirelythat
is
with
her
whole
soul
not
leaving
one
little
corner
that
was
not
open
to
him
she
felt
that
her
bond
with
her
husband
held
not
by
those
poetic
feelings
that
had
attracted
him
to
her
but
by
something
else
indefinite
but
firm
like
the
bond
between
her
own
soul
and
body
to
fluff
up
her
curls
wear
hoopskirts
and
sing
romances
in
order
to
attract
her
own
husband
would
have
seemed
as
strange
to
her
as
to
adorn
herself
in
order
to
be
pleased
with
herself
and
to
adorn
herself
in
order
to
be
liked
by
othersmaybe
she
would
have
enjoyed
that
now
she
did
not
know
but
she
simply
had
no
time
for
it
the
main
reason
why
she
was
not
occupied
with
singing
with
dressing
or
with
thinking
over
her
words
was
that
she
had
absolutely
no
time
to
be
occupied
with
them
it
is
known
that
man
has
the
ability
to
immerse
himself
entirely
in
one
subject
however
insignificant
it
might
seem
and
it
is
known
that
there
is
no
subject
so
insignificant
that
it
will
not
expand
to
infinity
if
attention
is
concentrated
on
it
the
subject
that
absorbed
natasha
fully
was
her
familythat
is
her
husband
who
had
to
be
kept
in
such
a
way
as
to
belong
entirely
to
her
to
the
household
and
her
children
whom
she
had
to
carry
give
birth
to
nurse
and
bring
up
and
the
more
she
entered
into
the
subject
that
absorbed
her
not
with
her
mind
but
with
her
whole
soul
with
her
whole
being
the
more
that
subject
expanded
under
her
attention
and
the
weaker
and
more
insignificant
her
own
forces
seemed
to
her
so
that
she
concentrated
them
all
on
one
thing
and
still
had
no
time
to
do
everything
that
seemed
necessary
to
her
discussions
and
arguments
about
womens
rights
about
the
relations
between
spouses
about
their
freedom
and
rights
though
they
had
not
yet
been
called
questions
as
they
are
now
were
the
same
then
as
they
are
now
but
these
questions
not
only
did
not
interest
natasha
but
she
decidedly
did
not
understand
them
these
questions
then
as
now
existed
only
for
those
people
who
see
in
marriage
nothing
but
the
pleasure
the
spouses
get
from
each
other
that
is
nothing
but
the
beginnings
of
marriage
and
not
its
whole
significance
which
consists
in
the
family
these
arguments
and
presentday
questions
similar
to
the
question
of
how
to
get
as
much
pleasure
as
possible
from
a
dinner
did
not
exist
then
as
they
do
not
exist
now
for
people
for
whom
the
purpose
of
a
dinner
is
nourishment
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
if
the
purpose
of
a
dinner
is
to
nourish
the
body
then
someone
who
suddenly
eats
two
dinners
will
perhaps
achieve
greater
pleasure
but
will
not
achieve
his
purpose
because
his
stomach
will
not
digest
two
dinners
if
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
then
someone
who
wishes
to
have
many
wives
or
husbands
will
perhaps
get
much
pleasure
but
in
any
case
will
have
no
family
if
the
purpose
of
a
dinner
is
nourishment
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
then
the
whole
question
is
solved
simply
by
not
eating
more
than
the
stomach
can
digest
and
not
having
more
wives
and
husbands
than
are
needed
for
a
family
that
is
one
of
each
natasha
needed
a
husband
a
husband
was
given
her
and
the
husband
gave
her
a
family
and
not
only
did
she
see
no
need
for
another
better
husband
but
as
all
her
inner
forces
were
directed
at
serving
this
husband
and
family
she
could
not
even
imagine
and
saw
no
interest
in
imagining
how
it
would
be
if
it
were
different
natasha
did
not
like
society
in
general
but
she
valued
all
the
more
the
society
of
her
relationscountess
marya
her
brother
her
mother
and
sonya
she
valued
the
society
of
the
people
to
whom
disheveled
in
a
dressing
gown
she
could
come
striding
out
of
the
nursery
with
a
joyful
face
and
show
a
diaper
with
a
yellow
instead
of
a
green
stain
and
hear
comforting
words
that
the
baby
was
now
much
better
natasha
let
herself
go
to
such
a
degree
that
her
clothes
her
hair
her
words
spoken
out
of
place
her
jealousyshe
was
jealous
of
sonya
of
the
governess
of
any
woman
beautiful
or
notwere
habitual
subjects
of
jokes
among
all
those
close
to
her
the
general
opinion
was
that
pierre
was
under
his
wifes
heel
and
in
fact
it
was
so
from
the
very
first
day
of
their
marriage
natasha
had
announced
her
demands
pierre
was
very
surprised
by
his
wifes
view
which
was
completely
new
to
him
that
every
minute
of
his
life
belonged
to
her
and
the
family
pierre
was
surprised
by
his
wifes
demands
but
was
flattered
by
them
and
submitted
to
them
pierres
subjection
consisted
in
his
not
daring
not
only
to
flirt
but
even
to
talk
smilingly
with
another
woman
not
daring
to
go
to
clubs
or
dinners
just
to
pass
the
time
not
daring
to
spend
money
on
whims
not
daring
to
leave
for
long
periods
of
time
except
on
business
in
which
his
wife
also
included
his
intellectual
pursuits
of
which
she
understood
nothing
but
to
which
she
ascribed
great
importance
in
exchange
for
all
that
pierre
had
the
full
right
at
home
to
dispose
as
he
liked
not
only
of
himself
but
of
the
whole
family
as
well
at
home
natasha
put
herself
on
the
footing
of
her
husbands
slave
and
the
whole
house
went
on
tiptoe
when
pierre
was
busy
reading
or
writing
in
his
study
pierre
needed
only
to
show
some
predilection
for
what
he
liked
to
be
invariably
fulfilled
he
needed
only
to
express
a
wish
for
natasha
to
jump
up
at
once
and
run
to
fulfill
it
the
entire
household
was
governed
only
by
the
imaginary
orders
of
the
husband
that
is
by
pierres
wishes
which
natasha
tried
to
guess
the
manner
and
place
of
their
life
their
acquaintances
their
connections
natashas
occupations
the
raising
of
the
childrennot
only
was
everything
done
according
to
the
express
will
of
pierre
but
natasha
tried
to
guess
what
might
follow
from
pierres
thoughts
voiced
in
conversation
and
she
rightly
guessed
the
essence
of
pierres
wishes
and
having
once
guessed
it
she
firmly
held
to
what
she
had
chosen
when
pierre
himself
wanted
to
be
unfaithful
to
his
wish
she
fought
him
with
his
own
weapons
thus
during
a
difficult
time
which
pierre
remembered
ever
after
when
natasha
had
given
birth
to
a
first
weak
child
and
they
had
had
to
change
wet
nurses
three
times
and
natasha
had
become
sick
with
despair
pierre
had
told
her
once
of
rousseaus
thoughts
with
which
he
was
in
complete
agreement
about
the
unnaturalness
and
harmfulness
of
wet
nurses
with
the
next
child
despite
the
opposition
of
her
mother
the
doctors
and
the
husband
himself
who
rose
up
against
her
nursing
as
a
then
unheardof
and
harmful
thing
she
had
stood
her
ground
and
from
then
on
had
nursed
all
her
children
herself
quite
often
in
moments
of
irritation
it
happened
that
the
husband
and
wife
would
spend
a
long
time
arguing
then
after
the
argument
pierre
to
his
joy
and
surprise
would
find
not
only
in
his
wifes
words
but
in
her
actions
the
very
thought
she
had
been
arguing
against
and
he
not
only
found
the
same
thought
but
found
it
purified
of
whatever
had
been
superfluous
provoked
by
passion
and
argument
in
his
expression
of
it
after
seven
years
of
married
life
pierre
felt
a
joyful
firm
consciousness
that
he
was
not
a
bad
man
and
he
felt
it
because
he
saw
himself
reflected
in
his
wife
in
himself
he
felt
all
the
good
and
the
bad
mixed
together
and
obscuring
each
other
but
only
what
was
truly
good
was
reflected
in
his
wife
all
that
was
not
entirely
good
was
rejected
and
this
reflection
came
not
by
way
of
logical
thinking
but
otherwiseas
a
mysterious
unmediated
reflection
xi
two
months
before
then
pierre
already
visiting
with
the
rostovs
had
received
a
letter
from
prince
fyodor
summoning
him
to
petersburg
to
discuss
important
questions
which
interested
the
members
of
a
society
in
petersburg
of
which
pierre
was
one
of
the
chief
founders
having
read
this
letter
as
she
read
all
her
husbands
letters
natasha
herself
suggested
that
he
go
to
petersburg
hard
as
his
absence
was
for
her
to
all
that
belonged
to
her
husbands
intellectual
abstract
pursuits
without
understanding
them
she
ascribed
enormous
importance
and
she
was
in
constant
fear
of
being
a
hindrance
to
this
activity
of
her
husbands
to
pierres
timid
questioning
glance
after
reading
the
letter
she
responded
by
asking
him
to
go
but
only
to
determine
for
certain
the
time
of
his
return
and
he
was
granted
a
fourweek
leave
ever
since
the
term
of
pierres
leave
had
expired
two
weeks
before
then
natasha
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
fear
sadness
and
irritation
denisov
a
retired
general
discontented
with
the
current
state
of
affairs
who
came
during
those
last
two
weeks
looked
at
natasha
with
surprise
and
sadness
as
at
an
unfaithful
portrait
of
a
onceloved
person
a
dull
despondent
gaze
outofplace
replies
and
conversation
about
the
nursery
was
all
he
saw
and
heard
from
the
former
enchantress
natasha
was
sad
and
irritated
all
that
time
especially
when
her
mother
her
brother
or
countess
marya
comforting
her
tried
to
excuse
pierre
and
think
up
reasons
for
his
delay
its
all
foolishness
all
trifles
said
natasha
all
his
reflections
which
dont
lead
to
anything
and
all
these
stupid
societies
she
said
of
the
very
things
in
the
great
importance
of
which
she
firmly
believed
and
she
would
go
off
to
the
nursery
to
nurse
her
only
boy
petya
no
one
could
tell
her
anything
so
soothing
and
sensible
as
this
little
threemonthold
being
when
he
lay
at
her
breast
and
she
felt
the
movement
of
his
mouth
and
the
puffing
of
his
little
nose
this
being
said
youre
angry
youre
jealous
youd
like
to
take
revenge
on
him
youre
afraid
but
here
i
am
here
i
am
and
there
was
nothing
to
reply
it
was
more
than
true
in
those
two
weeks
of
worry
natasha
so
often
resorted
to
the
baby
to
be
soothed
so
fussed
over
him
that
she
overfed
him
and
he
fell
sick
she
was
terrified
by
his
illness
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
what
she
needed
taking
care
of
him
made
it
easier
for
her
to
endure
the
worry
about
her
husband
she
was
nursing
when
the
noise
of
pierres
sleigh
was
heard
in
the
drive
and
the
nanny
who
knew
what
would
gladden
her
mistress
came
through
the
door
inaudibly
but
quickly
with
a
beaming
face
hes
come
natasha
asked
in
a
quick
whisper
afraid
to
move
lest
she
awaken
the
baby
who
was
falling
asleep
hes
come
dearie
whispered
the
nanny
the
blood
rushed
to
natashas
face
and
her
feet
made
an
involuntary
movement
but
she
could
not
jump
up
and
run
the
baby
opened
his
eyes
again
and
looked
youre
here
he
seemed
to
say
and
again
lazily
smacked
his
lips
having
gently
withdrawn
her
breast
natasha
rocked
the
baby
handed
him
over
to
the
nanny
and
went
with
quick
steps
to
the
door
but
at
the
door
she
stopped
as
if
feeling
a
pang
of
remorse
that
in
her
gladness
she
had
left
the
baby
too
quickly
and
turned
to
look
the
nanny
her
elbows
raised
was
lifting
the
baby
over
the
railing
of
his
little
bed
just
go
just
go
dearie
dont
worry
just
go
the
nanny
whispered
smiling
with
the
familiarity
that
is
usually
established
between
a
nanny
and
her
mistress
and
natasha
ran
with
light
steps
to
the
front
hall
denisov
with
his
pipe
coming
out
from
the
study
to
the
reception
room
here
recognized
natasha
for
the
first
time
a
bright
shining
joyful
light
was
pouring
in
streams
from
her
transformed
face
hes
come
she
said
to
him
on
the
run
and
denisov
felt
that
he
was
delighted
by
the
fact
that
pierre
for
whom
he
had
very
little
love
had
come
having
run
to
the
front
hall
natasha
saw
a
tall
figure
in
a
fur
coat
unwinding
his
scarf
its
him
really
here
he
is
she
said
to
herself
and
flying
to
him
she
embraced
him
pressed
his
head
to
her
breast
and
then
pushing
it
away
looked
at
the
frosty
redcheeked
and
happy
face
of
pierre
yes
its
him
happy
content
and
suddenly
she
remembered
all
the
torments
of
waiting
that
she
had
felt
over
the
last
two
weeks
the
joy
shining
on
her
face
vanished
she
frowned
and
a
stream
of
reproaches
and
angry
words
poured
out
on
pierre
yes
its
fine
for
you
youre
very
glad
you
had
a
good
timebut
what
about
me
you
might
at
least
feel
sorry
for
the
children
im
nursing
my
milk
went
bad
petya
almost
died
and
youre
having
a
very
good
time
yes
a
good
time
pierre
knew
he
was
not
guilty
because
he
could
not
have
come
sooner
he
knew
that
this
outburst
was
improper
on
her
part
and
knew
that
in
two
minutes
it
would
pass
he
knew
above
all
that
he
himself
was
cheerful
and
happy
he
would
have
liked
to
smile
but
did
not
even
dare
to
think
of
it
he
made
a
pitiful
frightened
face
and
cowered
i
couldnt
by
god
but
hows
petya
hes
all
right
now
lets
go
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
if
only
you
could
see
how
i
am
without
you
how
i
suffered
are
you
well
lets
go
lets
go
she
said
still
holding
on
to
his
hand
and
they
went
to
their
rooms
when
nikolai
and
his
wife
came
looking
for
pierre
he
was
in
the
nursery
holding
his
awakened
nursling
son
on
his
enormous
right
palm
dandling
him
a
merry
smile
lingered
on
his
broad
face
with
its
open
toothless
mouth
the
storm
had
long
since
spent
itself
and
a
bright
joyful
sun
shone
on
the
face
of
natasha
who
gazed
tenderly
at
her
husband
and
son
and
you
talked
it
all
over
well
with
prince
fyodor
natasha
was
saying
yes
perfectly
see
he
holds
it
up
his
head
natasha
meant
but
how
he
frightened
meand
did
you
see
the
princess
is
it
true
that
shes
in
love
with
that
yes
can
you
imagine
just
then
nikolai
and
countess
marya
came
in
pierre
without
putting
his
son
down
bent
over
exchanged
kisses
with
them
and
answered
their
questions
but
obviously
despite
the
many
interesting
things
that
had
to
be
discussed
the
baby
in
his
little
hat
with
his
wobbly
head
absorbed
all
pierres
attention
how
sweet
he
is
said
countess
marya
looking
at
the
baby
and
playing
with
him
this
is
what
i
dont
understand
nicolas
she
turned
to
her
husband
how
is
it
you
dont
understand
the
charm
of
these
charming
little
miracles
i
just
dont
i
cant
said
nikolai
looking
at
the
baby
with
a
cold
gaze
a
piece
of
meat
lets
go
pierre
yet
the
main
thing
is
hes
such
an
affectionate
father
said
countess
marya
to
justify
her
husband
but
only
when
theyre
a
year
old
or
so
no
pierres
an
excellent
nanny
said
natasha
he
says
his
hand
was
just
made
to
fit
a
babys
bottom
look
well
not
only
for
that
said
pierre
laughing
suddenly
shifting
the
baby
and
handing
him
to
the
nanny
xii
as
in
every
real
family
several
totally
different
worlds
lived
together
in
the
house
at
bald
hills
each
maintaining
its
own
particularity
and
yielding
to
the
others
but
merging
into
one
harmonious
whole
every
event
that
occurred
in
the
house
was
equallyjoyfully
or
sadlyimportant
for
all
these
worlds
but
each
world
had
its
own
reasons
independent
of
the
others
for
rejoicing
or
lamenting
over
whatever
the
event
might
be
thus
pierres
coming
was
a
joyful
important
event
and
as
such
it
had
an
effect
on
everyone
the
servantsthe
most
reliable
judges
of
their
masters
because
they
judge
not
by
conversations
and
expressions
of
feelings
but
by
acts
and
manner
of
lifewere
glad
of
pierres
coming
because
with
him
there
they
knew
the
count
would
stop
going
to
the
farmwork
every
day
would
be
more
cheerful
and
kind
and
also
because
everybody
would
get
costly
presents
for
the
feast
day
the
children
and
governesses
were
glad
of
bezukhovs
coming
because
no
one
else
drew
them
into
a
common
life
so
well
as
pierre
he
alone
could
play
on
the
clavichord
that
233cossaise
his
only
piece
to
which
one
could
dance
as
he
said
all
possible
dances
and
he
had
surely
brought
everyone
presents
nikolenka
who
was
now
a
thin
fifteenyearold
boy
with
curly
blond
hair
and
beautiful
eyes
sickly
and
intelligent
was
glad
because
uncle
pierre
as
he
called
him
was
the
object
of
his
admiration
and
passionate
love
no
one
had
instilled
any
special
love
for
pierre
into
nikolenka
and
he
saw
him
only
rarely
countess
marya
who
had
brought
him
up
employed
all
her
powers
to
make
nikolenka
love
her
husband
as
she
loved
him
and
nikolenka
did
love
his
uncle
but
he
loved
him
with
a
barely
noticeable
shade
of
contempt
as
for
pierre
he
adored
him
he
did
not
want
to
be
a
hussar
or
a
chevalier
of
st
george
like
uncle
nikolai
he
wanted
to
be
learned
and
intelligent
and
kind
like
pierre
in
pierres
presence
there
was
always
a
joyful
radiance
on
his
face
and
he
blushed
and
became
breathless
whenever
pierre
addressed
him
he
never
missed
a
single
word
of
what
pierre
said
and
afterwards
with
dessales
or
alone
with
himself
would
recall
and
ponder
the
meaning
of
pierres
every
word
pierres
past
his
misfortunes
before
the
year
twelve
of
which
he
had
put
together
a
vague
poetic
picture
from
what
he
had
heard
his
adventures
in
moscow
his
captivity
platon
karataev
of
whom
he
had
heard
from
pierre
his
love
for
natasha
whom
the
boy
also
loved
with
a
special
love
and
above
all
his
friendship
with
his
father
whom
nikolenka
did
not
rememberall
this
made
pierre
a
hero
and
a
sacred
figure
for
him
from
words
he
let
fall
about
his
father
and
natasha
from
the
excitement
with
which
pierre
spoke
of
the
dead
man
and
from
the
cautious
reverential
tenderness
with
which
natasha
spoke
of
him
the
boy
who
was
only
beginning
to
suspect
about
love
put
together
the
notion
that
his
father
had
loved
natasha
and
had
bequeathed
her
upon
dying
to
his
friend
this
father
whom
the
boy
did
not
remember
appeared
to
him
as
a
deity
whom
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
and
of
whom
he
did
not
think
otherwise
than
with
a
thrill
in
his
heart
and
tears
of
sadness
and
rapture
and
the
boy
was
happy
on
account
of
pierres
coming
the
guests
were
glad
of
pierre
as
a
man
who
always
animated
and
united
any
company
the
adults
of
the
household
not
to
mention
his
wife
were
glad
of
him
as
a
friend
in
whose
presence
life
was
easier
and
calmer
the
old
ladies
were
glad
of
the
presents
he
would
be
bringing
and
above
all
that
natasha
would
come
to
life
again
pierre
felt
the
various
views
of
these
various
worlds
upon
him
and
hastened
to
give
each
person
what
was
expected
pierre
the
most
absentminded
and
forgetful
of
men
had
this
time
bought
everything
according
to
the
list
his
wife
had
drawn
up
not
forgetting
either
the
errands
for
her
mother
and
brother
or
the
present
of
fabric
for
mrs
belovs
dress
or
the
toys
for
his
nephews
in
the
early
days
of
his
marriage
this
demand
of
his
wifesthat
he
do
that
and
not
forget
anything
he
had
undertaken
to
buyhad
seemed
strange
to
him
and
he
had
been
struck
by
her
serious
distress
when
on
his
first
trip
he
had
forgotten
everything
but
later
on
he
got
used
to
it
knowing
that
natasha
never
asked
anything
for
herself
and
asked
for
others
only
when
he
volunteered
he
now
unexpectedly
for
himself
took
a
childlike
pleasure
in
this
buying
of
presents
for
the
whole
household
and
never
forgot
anything
if
he
did
earn
natashas
reproach
it
was
only
for
buying
things
that
were
superfluous
and
too
expensive
in
the
opinion
of
most
people
to
her
other
shortcomings
or
qualities
in
pierres
opinionslovenliness
letting
herself
gonatasha
had
also
added
stinginess
from
the
time
when
pierre
began
to
live
in
a
big
household
a
family
which
required
big
expenses
he
noticed
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
spending
twice
less
than
before
and
that
his
affairs
recently
upset
in
particular
by
his
first
wifes
debts
had
begun
to
improve
life
was
cheaper
because
it
was
restricted
pierre
no
longer
had
nor
wished
to
have
that
most
expensive
luxury
which
is
the
kind
of
life
that
can
be
changed
at
any
moment
he
felt
that
his
way
of
life
was
now
defined
once
and
for
all
till
death
that
to
change
it
was
not
in
his
power
and
therefore
this
way
of
life
was
cheap
pierre
was
sorting
out
his
purchases
with
a
merry
smiling
face
look
at
this
he
said
unfolding
a
length
of
cotton
like
a
shopkeeper
natasha
sat
facing
him
holding
her
elder
daughter
on
her
lap
and
quickly
shifting
her
shining
eyes
from
her
husband
to
what
he
was
displaying
thats
for
mrs
belov
excellent
she
felt
it
for
quality
a
rouble
probably
pierre
told
her
the
price
expensive
said
natasha
well
how
glad
the
children
will
be
and
maman
only
you
neednt
have
bought
this
for
me
she
added
unable
to
suppress
a
smile
and
admiring
a
gold
and
pearl
comb
such
as
were
only
just
coming
into
fashion
ad232le
got
me
confused
buy
it
buy
it
said
pierre
when
will
i
ever
wear
it
natasha
put
it
into
her
braid
its
for
mashenkas
coming
out
maybe
theyll
be
wearing
them
again
by
then
well
come
on
and
taking
the
presents
they
went
first
to
the
nursery
then
to
the
countess
the
countess
as
usual
was
sitting
with
mrs
belov
over
double
patience
when
pierre
and
natasha
packages
under
their
arms
came
into
the
drawing
room
the
countess
was
already
past
sixty
her
hair
was
completely
white
and
she
wore
a
cap
with
a
ruffle
that
went
all
the
way
around
her
face
her
face
was
wrinkled
her
upper
lip
was
sunken
and
her
eyes
were
dull
after
the
deaths
of
her
son
and
her
husband
which
had
followed
so
quickly
upon
each
other
she
felt
herself
an
accidentally
forgotten
being
in
this
world
with
no
purpose
or
meaning
she
ate
drank
slept
woke
but
did
not
live
life
gave
her
no
impressions
at
all
she
needed
nothing
from
life
except
peace
and
that
peace
she
could
find
only
in
death
but
as
long
as
death
did
not
come
she
had
to
live
that
is
to
make
use
of
her
time
her
life
forces
in
her
there
was
noticeable
in
the
highest
degree
what
one
notices
in
very
small
children
and
very
old
people
in
her
life
no
external
purpose
could
be
seen
but
what
was
evident
was
only
the
need
to
exercise
her
various
inclinations
and
abilities
she
needed
to
eat
to
sleep
to
think
to
talk
to
weep
to
work
to
get
angry
and
so
on
only
because
she
had
a
stomach
a
brain
muscles
nerves
and
a
liver
she
did
all
that
without
any
external
impulse
not
as
people
do
in
the
full
force
of
life
when
behind
the
purpose
they
are
striving
towards
they
do
not
notice
another
purposethat
of
applying
their
forces
she
talked
only
because
she
had
a
physical
need
to
work
her
lungs
and
tongue
she
wept
like
a
baby
because
she
had
to
clear
her
nose
and
so
on
what
for
people
in
full
force
presented
itself
as
a
purpose
for
her
was
obviously
a
pretext
thus
in
the
morning
especially
if
she
had
eaten
something
rich
the
day
before
a
need
to
be
angry
appeared
in
her
and
then
she
chose
the
closest
pretextmrs
belovs
deafness
she
would
begin
to
say
something
softly
to
her
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
it
seems
warmer
today
my
dear
she
would
say
in
a
whisper
and
when
mrs
belov
replied
why
of
course
theyve
come
the
countess
would
grumble
crossly
my
god
how
deaf
and
stupid
she
is
another
pretext
was
her
snuff
which
seemed
to
her
now
dry
now
damp
now
poorly
rubbed
after
these
irritations
bile
would
spread
over
her
face
and
her
maids
knew
by
sure
signs
when
mrs
belov
would
again
be
deaf
and
the
snuff
would
again
be
damp
and
when
her
face
would
turn
yellow
as
she
needed
her
bile
to
work
so
she
also
sometimes
needed
her
remaining
thinking
capacity
to
work
and
the
pretext
for
that
was
a
game
of
patience
when
she
needed
to
weep
the
object
was
the
late
count
when
she
needed
to
worry
the
pretext
was
nikolai
and
his
health
when
she
needed
to
speak
caustically
the
pretext
was
countess
marya
when
she
needed
to
exercise
her
vocal
organsthis
happened
mainly
between
six
and
seven
after
a
digestive
rest
in
a
dark
roomthen
the
pretext
was
the
telling
of
ever
the
same
stories
to
ever
the
same
listeners
everyone
in
the
house
understood
the
old
womans
condition
though
no
one
ever
spoke
of
it
and
everyone
made
every
possible
effort
to
satisfy
her
needs
only
in
an
occasional
glance
and
sad
half
smile
exchanged
among
nikolai
pierre
natasha
and
marya
was
this
mutual
understanding
of
her
condition
expressed
but
besides
that
these
glances
said
something
else
they
said
that
she
had
already
finished
her
business
in
life
that
all
of
her
was
not
in
that
which
could
be
seen
in
her
now
that
we
would
all
be
the
same
and
that
it
was
a
joy
to
submit
to
her
to
restrain
oneself
for
the
sake
of
this
being
once
so
dear
once
as
full
of
life
as
we
and
now
so
pathetic
memento
morisaid
these
glances
of
all
the
household
only
quite
bad
and
stupid
people
and
the
little
children
did
not
understand
that
and
avoided
her
xiii
when
pierre
and
his
wife
came
to
the
drawing
room
the
countess
was
in
the
habitual
state
of
needing
to
occupy
herself
with
the
mental
work
of
double
patience
and
therefore
though
she
said
out
of
habit
the
words
she
always
spoke
when
pierre
or
her
son
returned
its
high
time
high
time
my
dear
weve
been
waiting
and
waiting
well
thank
god
and
as
the
presents
were
given
to
her
said
other
habitual
words
its
not
the
gift
thats
dear
my
friendthank
you
for
thinking
of
an
old
woman
like
meone
could
see
that
pierres
coming
was
disagreeable
to
her
at
that
moment
because
it
distracted
her
from
her
unfinished
double
patience
she
finished
the
patience
and
only
then
received
the
presents
the
presents
consisted
of
a
wonderfully
worked
case
for
cards
a
bright
blue
s232vres
cup
with
a
lid
and
pictures
of
shepherdesses
and
a
gold
snuffbox
with
a
portrait
of
the
late
count
which
pierre
had
ordered
from
a
miniaturist
in
petersburg
the
countess
had
long
been
wishing
for
that
she
did
not
feel
like
weeping
now
and
therefore
glanced
indifferently
at
the
portrait
and
interested
herself
more
in
the
case
thank
you
my
friend
youve
comforted
me
she
said
as
she
always
did
but
the
best
thing
is
that
youve
brought
yourself
ive
never
seen
the
like
of
it
you
ought
to
give
your
wife
a
scolding
what
is
it
shes
like
a
crazy
person
without
you
doesnt
see
anything
doesnt
remember
anything
she
said
her
habitual
words
look
anna
timofeevna
she
added
what
a
case
our
boys
brought
me
mrs
belov
praised
the
gifts
and
admired
her
cotton
fabric
though
pierre
natasha
nikolai
marya
and
denisov
had
much
to
talk
about
that
they
would
not
speak
of
in
the
countesss
presence
not
because
anything
was
concealed
from
her
but
because
she
was
so
behind
in
many
things
that
if
one
began
to
say
something
in
her
presence
it
would
be
necessary
to
answer
her
questions
put
in
inappropriately
and
repeat
once
more
what
had
already
been
repeated
to
her
several
timesto
tell
her
that
this
one
had
died
that
that
one
had
married
which
she
once
more
would
not
rememberbut
they
sat
over
tea
as
usual
by
the
samovar
in
the
drawing
room
and
pierre
answered
the
countesss
questions
needless
for
her
and
of
interest
to
no
one
saying
that
prince
vassily
had
aged
and
that
countess
marya
vassilievna
had
sent
her
greetings
and
remembered
her
and
so
on
such
conversation
of
interest
to
no
one
but
necessary
went
on
all
through
tea
for
tea
around
the
round
table
and
the
samovar
at
which
sonya
presided
all
the
grownup
members
of
the
household
gathered
the
children
tutors
and
governesses
had
already
had
tea
and
their
voices
could
be
heard
in
the
neighboring
sitting
room
at
tea
everyone
sat
in
their
usual
places
nikolai
sat
at
a
little
table
by
the
stove
where
tea
was
served
to
him
the
old
borzoi
bitch
milka
daughter
of
the
first
milka
with
a
totally
grayhaired
face
against
which
her
big
black
protruding
eyes
showed
more
sharply
lay
in
an
armchair
beside
him
denisov
with
his
halfgray
curly
hair
mustache
and
sidewhiskers
in
an
unbuttoned
generals
tunic
sat
next
to
countess
marya
pierre
sat
between
his
wife
and
the
old
countess
he
was
talking
about
what
he
knew
might
interest
the
old
lady
and
be
understood
by
her
he
spoke
of
external
social
events
and
of
the
people
who
had
once
made
up
the
circle
of
the
old
countesss
contemporaries
who
had
once
been
an
actual
living
definite
circle
but
who
now
mostly
scattered
over
the
world
were
living
out
their
time
as
she
was
gleaning
the
remaining
ears
of
what
they
had
sown
in
their
lives
but
they
these
contemporaries
seemed
to
the
old
countess
the
only
serious
and
real
world
from
pierres
animation
natasha
could
see
that
his
trip
had
been
interesting
that
he
would
have
liked
to
tell
about
many
things
but
he
did
not
dare
speak
in
the
countesss
presence
denisov
besides
his
not
being
a
member
of
the
family
and
therefore
not
understanding
pierres
cautiousness
was
quite
interested
as
a
disgruntled
man
in
what
was
happening
in
petersburg
and
constantly
provoked
pierre
into
telling
now
about
some
story
that
had
just
happened
in
the
semyonovsky
regiment
now
about
arakcheev
now
about
the
biblical
society
pierre
occasionally
got
carried
away
and
began
telling
but
nikolai
and
natasha
brought
him
back
each
time
to
the
health
of
prince
ivan
and
countess
marya
antonovna
well
what
about
all
that
madness
gossner
and
the
tatarinov
womanis

pierre
stronger
than
ever

whole

mon
cher
ami
asked
the
countess
who
had
finished
her
tea
and
clearly
wished
to
find
a
pretext
for
getting
angry
after
eating
whats
that
you
say
the
government
i
dont
understand
it

maman
interrupted
nikolai
who
knew
how
to
translate
everything
into
his
mothers
language
its
that
prince
alexander
nikolaevich
golitsyn
has
organized
a
society
so
they
say
its
become
very
influential
arakcheev
and
golitsyn
pierre
said
imprudently

whole
government

what
a
government

see
conspiracies
everywhere

afraid
of
everything
why
what

nikolaevichs

very
respectable
man

to
meet

offended
that

on
nowadays

evangelical
societywell
whats
wrong
with
that
and
she
stood
up
everyone

up
and
with
a
stern
look
sailed
back
to
her
table
in
the
sitting
room
amidst
the
sad
silence
that
ensued
childrens
laughter
and
voices
were
heard
from
the
neighboring
room
evidently
some
joyful
excitement
was
going
on
among
the
children
ready

natashas
joyful
cry

rapturous
groan
of

voices
arose
in
the
room

two
shouted
the
children
that

two
stockings
which
by
a
secret
known
only
to
herself
anna
makarovna
knitted
at
once
on
her
needles
and
which
she
always
drew
triumphantly
one
out
of
the
other
before
the
children
when
the

soon
after
that
the
children
came

the

blushing
deeply
and
looking
up
at

with
admiring
shining
eyes

nodded
to
him
and
went
on
with
the
story

by
the
children

for

tea
from

sat
sullenly
and
stubbornly
at
the
samovar
and
questioned
pierre
the
curlyheaded
sickly
boy
with
his
shining
eyes
sat
in
the
corner
unnoticed
by
anyone

only
turning
his
curly
head
on
its
thin
neck
emerging
from
a
turneddown
collar
to
the
side
where
pierre
was
occasionally
trembled
and
whispered
something
to
himself
clearly
experiencing
some
new
and
strong
feeling
the
conversation
turned
around
that
contemporary
gossip
from
the
highest
government
in
which
the
majority
of
people
ordinarily
see
the
most
important
interest
of
internal
politics
denisov
discontented
with
the
government
for
his
own
unsuccesses
in
the
service
was
glad
to
learn
about
all
the
stupid
things
which
in
his
opinion
were
now
being
done
in
petersburg
and
made
his
observations
on
pierres
words
in
strong
and
sharp
terms
before
you
had
to
be
a
german
now
you
have
to
dance
with
this
tatarinov
woman
and
madame
kr252dener
to
readeckartshausen
and
the
rest
ah
id
turn
that
fine
fellow
bonaparte
loose
on
them
hed
knock
all
this
foolishness
out
of
them
well
have
you
ever
seen
anything
like
itgiving
the
semyonovsky
regiment
to
that
foot
soldier
schwartz
he
shouted
nikolai
though
without
denisovs
wish
to
find
everything
bad
also
considered
it
a
very
worthwhile
and
important
thing
to
discuss
the
government
and
considered
that
the
fact
that
a
was
appointed
minister
here
and
b
governor
general
there
and
that
the
sovereign
said
suchandsuch
but
the
minister
said
suchandsuchthat
all
this
was
a
very
significant
matter
and
he
considered
it
necessary
to
be
interested
in
it
and
questioned
pierre
about
it
under
the
questioning
of
these
two
interlocutors
the
conversation
never
departed
from
the
usual
character
of
gossip
about
high
spheres
of
government
but
natasha
knowing
all
the
ways
and
thoughts
of
her
husband
saw
that
pierre
had
long
wanted
to
but
could
not
lead
the
conversation
a
different
way
and
voice
his
innermost
thought
the
one
for
which
he
had
gone
to
petersburg
to
consult
with
his
new
friend
prince
fyodor
and
she
helped
him
with
a
question
how
was
his
business
with
prince
fyodor
what
is
it
about
asked
nikolai
the
same
thing
all
over
again
said
pierre
glancing
around
everybody
sees
that
things
are
taking
such
a
nasty
turn
that
they
cant
be
left
like
this
and
that
its
the
duty
of
all
honest
men
to
oppose
it
as
far
as
they
can
but
what
can
honest
men
do
nikolai
said
frowning
slightly
what
can
be
done
heres
what
lets
go
to
my
study
said
nikolai
natasha
who
had
long
anticipated
that
they
would
come
to
fetch
her
to
nurse
the
baby
heard
the
nanny
call
and
went
to
the
nursery
countess
marya
went
with
her
the
men
went
to
the
study
and
nikolenka
bolkonsky
unnoticed
by
his
uncle
went
there
too
and
sat
in
the
shadow
by
the
window
at
the
writing
table
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
denisov
eternal
fantasies
said
nikolai
heres
what
pierre
began
not
sitting
down
and
now
pacing
the
room
now
stopping
lisping
and
making
rapid
gestures
with
his
hands
while
he
talked
heres
what
the
situation
in
petersburg
is
like
this
the
sovereign
doesnt
enter
into
anything
hes
totally
given
up
to
this
mysticism
pierre
could
not
forgive
mysticism
in
anyone
now
all
he
seeks
is
peace
and
peace
can
be
given
him
only
by
those
people
sans
foi
ni
loi
who
hack
up
and
stifle
everything
far
and
wide
magnitsky
arakcheev
and
tutti
quanti
youll
agree
that
if
you
werent
personally
taken
up
with
farming
but
only
wanted
peace
then
the
harsher
your
bailiff
the
sooner
youd
achieve
your
purpose
he
turned
to
nikolai
well
but
what
are
you
getting
at
said
nikolai
well
and
so
everythings
falling
apart
theres
thievery
in
the
courts
in
the
army
only
the
rod
drill
settlementsthey
torment
the
people
stifle
enlightenment
whatever
is
young
and
honest
they
destroy
everybody
sees
that
it
cant
go
on
like
this
its
all
too
strained
and
bound
to
snap
pierre
said
as
people
have
been
saying
as
long
as
governments
have
existed
once
they
look
attentively
at
any
government
whatever
i
said
just
one
thing
to
them
in
petersburg
to
whom
asked
denisov
well
you
know
to
whom
said
pierre
glancing
significantly
from
under
his
eyebrows
to
prince
fyodor
and
all
of
them
to
contribute
to
enlightenment
and
philanthropy
is
all
very
well
of
course
its
a
splendid
aim
and
all
but
in
the
present
circumstances
something
else
is
needed
just
then
nikolai
noticed
the
presence
of
his
nephew
his
face
darkened
he
went
over
to
him
what
are
you
doing
here
why
let
him
be
said
pierre
taking
nikolai
by
the
arm
and
he
went
on
thats
not
enough
i
told
them
something
else
is
needed
now
when
you
stand
and
wait
for
that
tightened
string
to
snap
any
moment
when
everybodys
waiting
for
the
inevitable
upheavalpeople
must
join
hands
as
many
and
as
closely
as
possible
in
order
to
oppose
the
general
catastrophe
everything
young
and
strong
is
drawn
there
and
gets
corrupted
one
is
seduced
by
women
another
by
honors
a
third
by
vainglory
or
moneyand
they
go
over
to
the
other
camp
there
are
no
independent
people
like
you
and
me
left
i
say
expand
the
circle
of
the
society
let
the
mot
dordre
be
not
only
virtue
but
independence
and
activity
nikolai
having
let
his
nephew
be
angrily
moved
up
his
armchair
sat
down
in
it
and
as
he
listened
to
pierre
coughed
discontentedly
and
frowned
more
and
more
but
whats
the
purpose
of
your
activity
he
cried
and
in
what
relation
will
you
stand
to
the
government
heres
in
what
in
the
relation
of
helpers
the
society
may
not
be
secret
if
the
government
allows
it
not
only
is
it
not
hostile
to
the
government
but
it
is
a
society
of
true
conservatives
a
society
of
gentlemen
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
its
only
so
as
not
to
have
pugachev
come
tomorrow
and
put
a
knife
into
my
and
your
children
or
to
have
arakcheev
send
me
to
a
military
settlementwere
joining
hands
only
for
that
with
the
one
purpose
of
the
common
good
and
common
security
yes
but
a
secret
societyconsequently
a
hostile
and
harmful
one
which
can
breed
only
evil
said
nikolai
raising
his
voice
why
so
did
the
tugendbund
which
saved
europe
they
still
did
not
dare
to
think
then
that
russia
had
saved
europe
breed
anything
harmful
the
tugendbund
is
an
alliance
of
virtue
it
is
love
mutual
aid
its
what
christ
preached
on
the
cross
natasha
who
had
come
into
the
room
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
looked
joyfully
at
her
husband
she
did
not
rejoice
in
what
he
was
saying
she
was
not
even
interested
in
it
because
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
all
extremely
simple
and
that
she
had
long
known
it
it
seemed
so
because
she
knew
where
it
all
came
fromthe
whole
soul
of
pierre
but
she
rejoiced
looking
at
his
animated
rapturous
figure
with
still
more
joyful
rapture
pierre
was
looked
at
by
the
boy
they
had
all
forgotten
with
his
thin
neck
emerging
from
a
turneddown
collar
every
word
of
pierres
burned
his
heart
and
with
a
nervous
movement
of
the
fingersnot
noticing
it
himselfhe
kept
breaking
the
pens
and
sticks
of
sealing
wax
that
lay
on
his
uncles
table
what
im
proposing
is
not
at
all
what
you
think
but
something
like
what
the
german
tugendbund
was
well
brother
the
tugendbund
is
fine
for
sausage
makers
i
dont
understand
it
and
cant
even
pronounce
it
the
loud
resolute
voice
of
denisov
rang
out
everythings
nasty
and
vile
i
aree
only
this
tugendbund
i
dont
understand
but
if
you
dont
like
thingsrebellion
thats
the
way
je
suis
votre
homme
pierre
smiled
natasha
laughed
but
nikolai
knitted
his
brows
still
more
and
began
demonstrating
to
pierre
that
no
sort
of
upheaval
was
expected
and
that
all
the
danger
he
was
speaking
of
existed
only
in
his
imagination
pierre
demonstrated
the
contrary
and
as
his
mental
powers
were
stronger
and
more
resourceful
nikolai
felt
himself
up
against
the
wall
this
made
him
still
angrier
since
in
his
heart
not
by
reasoning
but
by
something
stronger
than
reasoning
he
knew
the
unquestionable
rightness
of
his
opinion
heres
what
ill
tell
you
he
said
getting
up
and
trying
to
prop
his
pipe
in
the
corner
with
a
nervous
gesture
and
finally
abandoning
it
i
cant
prove
anything
to
you
you
say
everythings
bad
with
us
and
therell
be
an
upheaval
i
dont
see
that
but
you
say
an
oath
is
a
conventional
thing
and
to
that
ill
tell
you
youre
my
best
friend
you
know
that
but
if
you
were
to
set
up
a
secret
society
and
start
opposing
the
government
whatever
it
might
be
i
know
that
my
duty
is
to
obey
it
and
if
arakcheev
ordered
me
right
now
to
go
against
you
with
a
squadron
and
cut
you
downid
go
without
thinking
for
a
second
you
can
say
whatever
you
like
after
these
words
an
awkward
silence
ensued
natasha
was
the
first
to
speak
defending
her
husband
and
attacking
her
brother
her
defense
was
weak
and
awkward
but
her
purpose
was
achieved
the
conversation
picked
up
again
and
no
longer
in
that
unpleasantly
hostile
tone
in
which
nikolais
last
words
had
been
spoken
when
they
all
rose
for
supper
nikolenka
bolkonsky
went
up
to
pierre
pale
with
shining
luminous
eyes
uncle
pierreyounoif
papa
were
alivehed
agree
with
you
he
asked
pierre
suddenly
realized
what
a
special
independent
complex
and
intense
work
of
feeling
and
thought
must
have
been
going
on
in
this
boy
while
he
was
talking
and
recalling
everything
he
had
said
he
was
vexed
that
the
boy
had
heard
him
however
he
had
to
give
him
an
answer
i
think
so
he
said
reluctantly
and
left
the
study
the
boy
bowed
his
head
and
here
it
was
as
if
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
what
he
had
done
on
the
table
he
blushed
and
went
over
to
nikolai
uncle
forgive
me
i
didnt
mean
to
do
it
he
said
pointing
to
the
broken
pens
and
sticks
of
wax
nikolai
gave
an
angry
start
all
right
all
right
he
said
throwing
the
pens
and
sticks
of
wax
under
the
table
and
clearly
having
a
hard
time
suppressing
the
wrath
that
had
risen
in
him
he
turned
away
you
shouldnt
have
been
here
at
all
he
said
xv
over
supper
the
conversation
was
no
longer
about
politics
and
societies
but
on
the
contrary
started
on
what
was
most
pleasant
for
nikolaimemories
of
the
year
twelvewhich
denisov
evoked
and
in
which
pierre
was
especially
nice
and
amusing
and
the
family
parted
on
the
most
friendly
terms
when
nikolai
having
undressed
in
his
study
after
supper
and
given
instructions
to
the
steward
who
had
long
been
waiting
went
to
the
bedroom
in
his
dressing
gown
he
found
his
wife
still
at
the
writing
table
she
was
writing
something
what
are
you
writing
marie
asked
nikolai
countess
marya
blushed
she
was
afraid
that
her
husband
would
not
understand
or
approve
of
what
she
was
writing
she
would
have
liked
to
hide
what
she
had
written
from
him
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
glad
that
he
had
found
her
and
that
she
could
tell
him
its
my
diary
nicolas
she
said
handing
him
a
blue
notebook
covered
with
her
firm
large
handwriting
your
diary
nikolai
said
with
a
shade
of
mockery
and
took
the
notebook
from
her
it
was
written
in
french
december
4
today
andryusha
the
elder
son
woke
up
and
did
not
want
to
get
dressed
and
mlle
louise
sent
for
me
he
was
capricious
and
headstrong
i
tried
to
threaten
him
but
he
became
still
more
angry
then
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
let
him
be
and
the
nanny
and
i
began
getting
the
other
children
up
and
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
like
him
he
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
as
if
he
was
surprised
then
in
nothing
but
his
nightshirt
he
jumped
up
to
me
and
burst
into
such
sobs
that
it
was
long
before
i
could
calm
him
it
was
clear
that
he
suffered
most
of
all
from
having
upset
me
then
in
the
evening
when
i
gave
him
his
little
ticket
he
again
wept
pitifully
as
he
kissed
me
with
him
everything
can
be
done
by
tenderness
what
is
a
little
ticket
asked
nikolai
ive
begun
giving
the
older
ones
little
reports
in
the
evening
on
their
behavior
nikolai
glanced
into
the
luminous
eyes
that
were
looking
at
him
and
went
on
turning
pages
and
reading
the
diary
contained
everything
from
the
childrens
life
that
the
mother
found
noteworthy
expressing
the
childrens
character
or
inspiring
general
thoughts
about
methods
of
upbringing
these
were
for
the
most
most
insignificant
trifles
but
they
did
not
seem
so
either
to
the
mother
or
to
the
father
as
he
now
read
this
childrens
diary
for
the
first
time
for
december
5
there
was
written
mitya
was
mischievous
at
the
table
papa
ordered
that
he
not
be
given
dessert
he
was
not
but
he
looked
at
the
others
so
pitifully
and
greedily
while
they
ate
i
think
that
to
punish
by
depriving
of
sweets
develops
greed
tell
nicolas
nikolai
set
the
book
aside
and
looked
at
his
wife
the
luminous
eyes
gazed
at
him
questioningly
did
he
approve
of
her
diary
or
not
there
could
be
no
doubt
not
only
of
nikolais
approval
but
also
of
his
admiration
of
his
wife
maybe
it
neednt
be
done
so
pedantically
maybe
it
neednt
be
done
at
all
thought
nikolai
but
this
tireless
eternal
inner
effort
aimed
only
at
the
moral
good
of
the
childrenthis
he
admired
if
nikolai
could
have
been
conscious
of
his
feeling
he
would
have
found
that
his
firm
tender
and
proud
love
for
his
wife
had
always
been
based
on
this
feeling
of
wonder
before
her
inner
life
before
that
lofty
moral
world
almost
inaccessible
to
him
in
which
his
wife
lived
always
he
was
proud
that
she
was
so
intelligent
and
good
being
conscious
of
his
own
insignificance
before
her
in
the
spiritual
world
and
rejoiced
the
more
that
she
with
her
soul
not
only
belonged
to
him
but
made
up
a
him
i
approve
i
approve
very
much
my
dearest
he
said
with
a
significant
air
and
after
some
silence
he
added
and
i
behaved
badly
today
you
werent
in
the
study
pierre
and
i
began
to
argue
and
i
got
angry
its
impossible
hes
such
a
child
i
dont
know
what
would
happen
to
him
if
natasha
didnt
keep
him
on
a
leash
can
you
imagine
why
he
went
to
petersburgtheyre
setting
up
i
know
said
countess
marya
natasha
told
me
well
so
you
know
nikolai
went
on
getting
excited
at
the
mere
recollection
of
the
argument
he
wants
to
convince
me
that
its
the
duty
of
every
honest
man
to
go
against
the
government
whereas
my
oath
and
my
dutyim
sorry
you
werent
there
they
all
attacked
me
denisov
and
natashanatashas
killingly
funny
she
really
keeps
him
under
her
heel
but
once
it
comes
to
arguments
she
has
no
words
of
her
own
she
just
speaks
his
words
nikolai
added
yielding
to
that
irresistible
impulse
that
makes
us
judge
the
nearest
and
dearest
people
nikolai
forgot
that
what
he
was
saying
about
natasha
could
be
said
word
for
word
about
himself
in
relation
to
his
wife
yes
ive
noticed
that
said
countess
marya
when
i
told
him
that
my
duty
and
oath
were
highest
of
all
he
began
proving
god
knows
what
its
a
pity
you
werent
there
what
would
you
have
said
in
my
opinion
youre
completely
right
and
i
told
natasha
so
pierre
says
that
everybodys
suffering
tormented
becoming
depraved
and
that
our
duty
is
to
help
our
neighbors
of
course
hes
right
said
countess
marya
but
he
forgets
that
we
have
other
closer
responsibilities
which
god
himself
has
indicated
to
us
and
that
we
can
risk
ourselves
but
not
our
children
well
there
there
thats
the
same
thing
i
told
him
nikolai
picked
up
fancying
that
he
had
indeed
said
that
same
thing
but
he
keeps
at
it
about
love
for
ones
neighbor
and
christianity
and
all
that
in
front
of
nikolenka
who
also
got
into
the
study
and
broke
everything
ah
you
know
nicolas
i
often
suffer
over
nikolenka
said
countess
marya
hes
such
an
extraordinary
boy
and
im
afraid
i
forget
about
him
because
of
my
own
we
all
have
children
we
all
have
relations
but
he
has
nobody
hes
eternally
alone
with
his
thoughts
well
i
dont
think
you
have
anything
to
reproach
yourself
with
on
his
account
youve
done
and
are
doing
everything
for
him
that
a
most
tender
mother
could
do
for
her
son
and
naturally
im
glad
of
that
hes
a
nice
nice
boy
today
he
was
listening
to
pierre
in
some
sort
of
trance
and
can
you
imagine
we
go
to
supper
i
look
and
hes
broken
everything
on
my
table
to
bits
and
he
told
me
at
once
ive
never
seen
him
tell
a
lie
a
nice
nice
boy
repeated
nikolai
who
in
his
heart
did
not
like
nikolenka
but
whom
he
was
always
ready
to
acknowledge
as
nice
still
its
not
the
same
as
a
mother
said
countess
marya
i
feel
its
not
the
same
and
i
suffer
over
it
a
wonderful
boy
but
im
terribly
afraid
for
him
company
would
do
him
good
well
it
wont
be
long
this
summer
ill
take
him
to
petersburg
said
nikolai
yes
pierre
has
always
been
and
will
remain
a
dreamer
he
went
on
returning
to
the
conversation
in
the
study
which
had
clearly
disturbed
him
well
what
do
i
care
about
all
thatthat
arakcheev
is
no
good
and
the
restwhat
did
i
care
when
i
got
married
and
had
so
many
debts
that
they
wanted
to
throw
me
into
prison
and
had
a
mother
who
was
unable
to
see
or
understand
it
and
then
you
the
children
work
is
it
for
my
own
pleasure
that
im
in
the
office
and
tending
to
business
from
morning
till
night
no
i
know
that
i
must
work
to
comfort
my
mother
to
pay
you
back
and
not
leave
the
children
as
poor
as
i
was
countess
marya
wanted
to
tell
him
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
that
he
ascribed
too
much
importance
to
this
business
but
she
knew
it
was
unnecessary
and
useless
to
say
it
she
only
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
he
accepted
this
gesture
of
his
wifes
as
an
approval
and
confirmation
of
his
thoughts
and
after
some
silent
reflection
went
on
thinking
aloud
you
know
marie
he
said
today
ilya
mitrofanych
this
was
the
business
manager
came
from
the
tambov
estate
and
told
me
that
theyre
now
offering
eighty
thousand
for
the
timber
and
with
an
animated
face
nikolai
began
talking
about
the
possibility
of
buying
back
otradnoe
in
a
very
short
time
ten
more
years
of
life
and
ill
leave
the
children
in
an
excellent
situation
countess
marya
listened
to
her
husband
and
understood
all
that
he
said
to
her
she
knew
that
when
he
thought
aloud
like
that
he
sometimes
asked
her
what
he
had
said
and
was
angry
when
he
noticed
that
she
had
been
thinking
of
something
else
but
it
cost
her
great
effort
to
do
so
because
what
he
said
did
not
interest
her
at
all
she
looked
at
him
and
did
not
so
much
think
about
something
else
as
feel
about
something
else
she
felt
a
submissive
tender
love
for
this
man
who
would
never
understand
all
that
she
understood
and
as
if
because
of
that
she
loved
him
still
more
strongly
with
a
shade
of
passionate
tenderness
besides
this
feeling
which
wholly
absorbed
her
and
kept
her
from
entering
into
the
details
of
her
husbands
plans
thoughts
flashed
in
her
head
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
he
was
talking
about
she
was
thinking
about
her
nephew
her
husbands
account
of
his
agitation
over
pierres
talk
had
struck
her
deeply
imagined
various
traits
of
his
gentle
sensitive
character
and
thinking
of
her
nephew
she
also
thought
of
her
own
children
she
did
not
compare
her
nephew
with
her
children
but
compared
her
feeling
for
them
and
found
it
sad
that
something
was
lacking
in
her
feeling
for
nikolenka
sometimes
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
this
difference
was
caused
by
age
but
she
felt
that
she
was
guilty
before
him
and
in
her
heart
she
promised
herself
to
mend
her
ways
and
do
the
impossiblethat
is
in
this
life
to
love
her
husband
and
her
children
and
nikolenka
and
all
who
were
close
to
her
as
christ
loved
mankind
countess
maryas
soul
always
strove
towards
the
infinite
eternal
and
perfect
and
therefore
could
never
be
at
peace
the
stern
expression
of
concealed
lofty
suffering
of
a
soul
burdened
by
a
body
came
to
her
face
nikolai
looked
at
her
my
god
what
will
become
of
us
if
she
dies
as
it
seems
to
me
she
will
when
she
has
such
a
face
he
thought
and
standing
in
front
of
the
icon
he
began
to
recite
the
evening
prayers
xvi
natasha
left
alone
with
her
husband
also
talked
as
only
a
wife
and
husband
can
talk
that
is
grasping
thoughts
and
conveying
them
to
each
other
with
extraordinary
clarity
and
quickness
in
a
way
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
logic
without
recourse
to
opinions
conclusions
and
deductions
but
in
a
totally
special
way
natasha
was
so
used
to
talking
with
her
husband
in
this
way
that
for
her
a
logical
train
of
thought
in
pierre
served
as
a
sure
sign
that
something
was
wrong
between
them
when
he
began
to
prove
to
speak
reasonably
and
calmly
and
when
she
carried
along
by
his
example
began
to
do
the
same
she
knew
it
would
inevitably
lead
to
a
quarrel
from
the
very
moment
they
were
left
alone
and
natasha
with
wideopen
happy
eyes
went
softly
up
to
him
and
suddenly
seized
his
head
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
saying
now
youre
all
mine
all
mine
you
wont
get
awayfrom
that
moment
such
a
conversation
began
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
logic
contrary
if
only
because
totally
different
subjects
were
discussed
at
one
and
the
same
time
this
simultaneous
discussion
of
many
things
not
only
did
not
hinder
their
clarity
of
understanding
but
on
the
contrary
was
the
surest
sign
that
they
fully
understood
each
other
as
everything
in
a
dream
is
false
senseless
and
contradictory
except
for
the
feeling
that
guides
the
dream
so
in
this
sort
of
communication
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
reason
it
was
not
the
words
that
were
consistent
and
clear
but
only
the
feeling
that
guided
them
natasha
told
pierre
about
her
brothers
daily
life
about
how
she
suffered
and
did
not
live
without
her
husband
and
about
how
she
had
come
to
love
marie
still
more
and
how
marie
was
better
than
her
in
all
respects
in
saying
that
natasha
was
sincerely
acknowledging
that
she
saw
maries
superiority
but
while
saying
it
she
demanded
that
pierre
still
prefer
her
to
marie
and
to
all
other
women
and
now
especially
after
having
seen
so
many
women
in
petersburg
that
he
repeat
it
to
her
again
pierre
in
reply
to
natashas
words
told
her
how
unbearable
it
was
for
him
to
be
at
soir233es
and
dinners
with
ladies
in
petersburg
ive
completely
forgotten
how
to
talk
with
ladies
he
said
it
was
simply
boring
especially
since
i
was
so
busy
natasha
looked
at
him
intently
and
went
on
marie
is
so
lovely
she
said
how
well
she
understands
children
its
as
if
she
sees
only
their
souls
yesterday
for
instance
mitenka
began
to
fuss
ah
hes
so
much
like
his
father
pierre
interrupted
natasha
understood
why
he
made
this
observation
about
mitenkas
resemblance
to
nikolai
he
had
an
unpleasant
memory
of
the
argument
with
his
brotherinlaw
and
wanted
to
know
natashas
opinion
about
it
nikolenka
has
this
weakness
that
if
something
isnt
generally
accepted
by
everybody
he
wont
agree
with
it
for
anything
but
i
understand
that
you
precisely
value
what
can
ouvrir
une
carri232re
she
said
repeating
words
that
pierre
had
said
once
no
the
main
thing
is
said
pierre
that
for
nikolai
thoughts
and
arguments
are
an
amusement
almost
a
pastime
here
hes
collecting
a
library
and
has
made
it
a
rule
not
to
buy
a
new
book
before
hes
read
what
hes
boughtsismondi
and
rousseau
and
montesquieu
pierre
added
with
a
smile
you
know
how
he
and
i
he
was
beginning
to
soften
his
words
but
natasha
interrupted
him
letting
him
feel
that
it
was
unnecessary
so
you
say
thinking
is
an
amusement
for
him
yes
and
for
me
all
the
rest
is
an
amusement
all
the
while
i
was
in
petersburg
i
saw
everyone
as
if
in
a
dream
when
im
taken
up
with
a
thought
all
the
rest
is
an
amusement
ah
what
a
pity
i
didnt
see
you
greet
the
children
said
natasha
which
of
them
was
most
glad
liza
surely
yes
said
pierre
and
he
went
on
with
what
occupied
him
nikolai
says
we
shouldnt
think
but
i
cant
help
it
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
in
petersburg
i
felt
i
can
tell
you
that
without
me
it
would
all
fall
apart
each
one
pulling
in
his
own
direction
but
i
succeeded
in
uniting
them
all
and
besides
my
thought
is
so
simple
and
clear
i
dont
say
we
should
oppose
this
or
that
we
may
be
mistaken
what
i
say
is
lets
join
hands
with
those
who
love
the
good
and
let
there
be
one
banneractive
virtue
prince
sergei
is
a
nice
man
and
intelligent
natasha
would
have
had
no
doubt
that
pierres
thought
was
a
great
thought
but
one
thing
confused
her
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
her
husband
can
it
be
that
a
man
so
important
and
necessary
for
society
is
at
the
same
time
my
husband
how
did
it
happen
that
way
she
wanted
to
express
this
doubt
to
him
who
and
what
are
the
people
who
could
decide
whether
he
is
really
so
much
smarter
than
everyone
else
she
asked
herself
and
went
over
in
her
imagination
the
people
whom
pierre
greatly
respected
judging
by
his
accounts
there
was
no
one
he
respected
so
much
as
platon
karataev
you
know
what
im
thinking
about
she
said
about
platon
karataev
how
about
him
would
he
approve
of
you
now
pierre
was
not
surprised
in
the
least
by
this
question
he
understood
his
wifes
train
of
thought
platon
karataev
he
said
and
fell
to
thinking
evidently
trying
in
all
sincerity
to
imagine
karataevs
opinion
on
this
subject
he
wouldnt
understand
but
anyhow
i
think
yes
i
love
you
terribly
natasha
said
suddenly
terribly
terribly
no
he
wouldnt
approve
of
me
said
pierre
having
reflected
what
he
would
approve
of
is
our
family
life
he
wished
so
much
to
see
seemliness
happiness
peace
in
everything
and
i
would
have
shown
us
to
him
with
pride
now
you
sayparting
but
you
wouldnt
believe
what
a
special
feeling
i
have
for
you
after
weve
been
parted
yes
theres
also
natasha
began
no
its
not
that
i
never
stop
loving
you
and
its
impossible
to
love
more
and
thats
especiallywell
yes
he
did
not
finish
because
their
eyes
met
and
said
all
the
rest
what
stupidity
natasha
said
suddenly
that
the
honeymoon
and
the
first
time
is
the
happiest
on
the
contrary
now
its
best
if
only
you
didnt
go
away
remember
how
we
quarreled
and
it
was
always
my
fault
always
and
what
we
quarreled
abouti
dont
even
remember
always
the
same
thing
said
pierre
smiling
jealo
dont
say
it
i
cant
bear
it
natasha
cried
and
a
cold
angry
gleam
lit
up
in
her
eyes
did
you
see
her
she
added
after
a
pause
no
and
if
i
had
i
wouldnt
have
recognized
her
they
fell
silent
ah
you
know
as
you
were
talking
in
the
study
i
was
looking
at
you
natasha
began
clearly
trying
to
ward
off
the
intruding
cloud
you
and
he
are
as
alike
as
two
drops
of
waterthe
boy
i
mean
she
referred
to
her
son
that
way
ah
its
time
to
go
to
himtimetoo
bad
i
have
to
leave
they
fell
silent
for
a
few
seconds
then
they
suddenly
turned
to
each
other
and
started
saying
something
at
the
same
time
pierre
began
with
selfsatisfaction
and
enthusiasm
natasha
with
a
quiet
happy
smile
colliding
they
both
stopped
giving
way
to
each
other
no
what
were
you
saying
speak
speak
no
you
tell
me
mine
was
just
something
stupid
said
natasha
pierre
said
what
he
had
started
it
was
a
continuation
of
his
selfsatisfied
discourse
about
his
success
in
petersburg
it
seemed
to
him
at
that
moment
that
he
was
called
upon
to
give
a
new
direction
to
the
whole
of
russian
society
and
the
whole
world
i
was
going
to
say
only
that
all
thoughts
that
have
great
consequences
are
always
simple
my
whole
thought
is
that
since
vicious
people
band
together
and
constitute
a
force
honest
people
need
only
do
the
same
its
that
simple
yes
and
what
were
you
going
to
say
just
something
stupid
no
but
still
its
nothing
trifles
said
natasha
her
smile
shining
still
more
brightly
i
only
wanted
to
tell
you
about
petya
today
the
nanny
came
to
take
him
from
me
he
laughed
closed
his
eyes
and
pressed
himself
to
mehe
must
have
thought
he
was
hiding
hes
awfully
sweet
thats
him
shouting
well
goodbye
and
she
left
the
room
at
that
same
time
downstairs
in
nikolenka
bolkonskys
the
house
in
his
bedroom
an
icon
lamp
was
burning
as
always
the
boy
was
afraid
of
the
dark
and
they
could
not
get
him
to
drop
this
bad
habit
dessales
slept
propped
up
high
on
his
four
pillows
and
his
roman
nose
produced
the
steady
sounds
of
snoring
nikolenka
having
just
woken
up
in
a
cold
sweat
his
eyes
wide
open
sat
up
on
his
bed
and
looked
around
a
terrible
dream
had
awakened
him
in
his
dream
he
had
seen
himself
and
pierre
wearing
helmetsthe
kind
illustrated
in
his
edition
of
plutarch
he
and
uncle
pierre
were
marching
at
the
head
of
a
huge
army
this
army
consisted
of
slanting
white
lines
that
filled
the
air
like
the
spiderwebs
that
fly
about
in
the
fall
and
that
dessales
called
le
fil
de
la
vierge
ahead
was
glory
just
the
same
as
these
threads
only
slightly
denser
theyhe
and
pierrewere
racing
lightly
and
joyfully
nearer
and
nearer
to
their
goal
suddenly
the
threads
that
moved
them
began
to
weaken
to
tangle
the
going
became
heavy
and
uncle
nikolai
ilyich
stood
before
them
in
a
stern
and
menacing
pose
did
you
do
that
he
said
pointing
to
the
brokenup
wax
and
pens
i
loved
you
but
arakcheev
has
given
me
orders
and
ill
kill
the
first
one
who
moves
forward
nikolenka
turned
to
look
at
pierre
but
there
was
no
longer
any
pierre
pierre
was
his
father
prince
andrei
and
his
father
had
no
image
or
form
but
he
was
there
and
seeing
him
nikolenka
felt
weak
from
love
he
felt
strengthless
boneless
and
liquid
his
father
caressed
and
pitied
him
but
uncle
nikolai
ilyich
moved
closer
and
closer
to
them
nikolenka
was
overcome
by
terror
and
woke
up
father
he
thought
father
though
there
were
two
portraits
of
a
good
likeness
in
the
house
nikolenka
never
pictured
prince
andrei
in
his
human
image
father
was
with
me
and
caressed
me
he
approved
of
me
he
approved
of
uncle
pierre
whatever
he
saysill
do
mucius
scaevola
burned
his
hand
why
shouldnt
it
be
the
same
in
my
life
i
know
they
want
me
to
study
and
i
will
study
but
some
day
ill
stop
and
then
ill
do
it
i
ask
god
for
only
one
thing
that
its
the
same
with
me
as
with
the
men

that
even
he
would
be

with
i
the
subject
of
history
is
the
life
of
peoples
and
of
mankind
to
grasp
directly
and
embrace
in
wordsto
describethe
life
not
only
of
mankind
but
of
one
people
appears
impossible
all
the
ancient
historians
used
one
and
the
same
method
to
describe
and
grasp
the
seemingly
ungraspablethe
life
of
a
people
they
described
the
activity
of
individual
men
who
ruled
the
people
and
this
activity
expressed
for
them
the
activity
of
the
whole
people
to
the
questions
of
how
individual
men
made
peoples
act
according
to
their
will
and
what
governed
the
will
of
these
men
themselves
the
ancients
answered
the
first
question
by
recognizing
the
will
of
a
divinity
who
subjected
peoples
to
the
will
of
one
chosen
man
and
the
second
by
recognizing
that
the
same
divinity
guided
the
will
of
the
chosen
one
towards
a
predestined
goal
for
the
ancients
these
questions
were
decided
by
faith
in
the
direct
participation
of
a
divinity
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
modern
history
in
its
theory
has
rejected
both
of
these
propositions
it
would
seem
that
having
rejected
the
beliefs
of
the
ancients
in
the
subjection
of
peoples
to
a
divinity
and
in
the
definite
goal
towards
which
peoples
are
led
modern
history
should
study
not
the
manifestations
of
power
but
the
causes
that
form
it
modern
history
has
not
done
that
having
rejected
the
views
of
the
ancients
in
theory
it
follows
them
in
practice
in
place
of
men
endowed
with
divine
power
and
directly
guided
by
the
will
of
a
divinity
modern
history
has
put
either
heroes
endowed
with
extraordinary
superhuman
capacities
or
simply
men
of
the
most
diverse
qualities
from
monarchs
to
journalists
who
guide
the
masses
in
place
of
the
former
godpleasing
goals
of
the
peoplesthe
jews
the
greeks
the
romanswhich
the
ancients
took
for
goals
of
the
movement
of
mankind
modern
history
has
set
up
its
own
goalsthe
good
of
the
french
the
germans
the
english
and
in
its
highest
abstraction
the
goal
of
the
good
of
all
human
civilization
usually
understood
as
the
people
occupying
the
small
northwest
corner
of
a
large
continent
modern
history
has
rejected
the
beliefs
of
the
ancients
without
putting
in
their
place
a
new
view
and
the
logic
of
the
situation
has
made
historians
who
fancied
they
had
rejected
the
divine
power
of
kings
and
the
fatum
of
old
come
by
a
different
route
to
the
same
thing
to
the
recognition
that
1
peoples
are
guided
by
individual
men
and
2
there
exists
a
certain
goal
towards
which
peoples
and
mankind
move
these
two
old
inevitable
propositions
lie
at
the
basis
of
all
the
works
of
modern
history
from
gibbon
to
buckle
despite
their
apparent
disagreement
and
the
apparent
novelty
of
their
views
first
the
historian
describes
the
activity
of
separate
persons
who
in
his
opinion
guide
mankind
one
considers
monarchs
military
commanders
ministers
to
be
such
another
besides
monarchs
and
orators
includes
learned
reformers
philosophers
and
poets
second
the
historian
knows
the
goal
towards
which
mankind
is
being
led
for
one
this
goal
is
the
greatness
of
the
roman
spanish
or
french
state
for
another
it
is
freedom
equality
a
certain
kind
of
civilization
in
a
small
corner
of
the
world
known
as
europe
in
1789
a
ferment
arises
in
paris
it
grows
spreads
and
expresses
itself
in
a
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
east
several
times
this
movement
directed
to
the
east
comes
into
collision
with
a
countermovement
from
east
to
west
in
the
year
twelve
it
reaches
its
utmost
limitmoscow
and
with
remarkable
symmetry
the
countermovement
from
east
to
west
is
accomplished
drawing
with
itself
as
the
first
movement
had
done
the
peoples
of
the
center
the
countermovement
reaches
the
point
of
departure
in
the
westparisand
subsides
during
this
twentyyear
period
of
time
an
enormous
number
of
fields
go
unplowed
houses
are
burned
trade
changes
direction
millions
of
people
become
poor
become
rich
migrate
and
millions
of
christians
who
profess
the
law
of
love
of
their
neighbor
kill
each
other
what
does
it
all
mean
why
did
it
happen
what
made
these
people
burn
houses
and
kill
their
own
kind
what
were
the
causes
of
these
events
what
force
made
people
act
that
way
these
are
the
involuntary
simplehearted
and
most
legitimate
questions
that
mankind
poses
for
itself
encountering
the
memorials
and
traditions
of
that
past
period
of
movement
to
settle
these
questions
mankinds
common
sense
turns
to
the
science
of
history
which
has
for
its
goal
the
selfknowledge
of
peoples
and
of
mankind
if
history
had
maintained
the
view
of
the
ancients
it
would
say
that
a
divinity
to
reward
or
punish
its
people
gave
power
to
napoleon
and
guided
his
will
towards
achieving
its
divine
purposes
and
that
answer
would
be
full
and
clear
one
might
believe
or
not
believe
in
the
divine
significance
of
napoleon
but
for
the
believer
in
it
everything
in
the
history
of
that
time
would
be
comprehensible
and
there
could
not
be
a
single
contradiction
but
modern
history
cannot
answer
in
that
way
science
does
not
recognize
the
view
of
the
ancients
on
the
direct
participation
of
a
divinity
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
and
therefore
it
should
give
other
answers
modern
history
in
answer
to
these
questions
says
you
want
to
know
what
this
movement
means
why
it
occurred
and
what
force
produced
these
events
listen
louis
xiv
was
a
very
proud
and
presumptuous
man
he
had
suchandsuch
mistresses
and
suchandsuch
ministers
and
he
ruled
france
badly
louiss
heirs
were
also
weak
men
and
also
ruled
france
badly
they
too
had
suchandsuch
favorites
and
suchandsuch
mistresses
besides
certain
men
were
writing
books
at
that
time
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
some
two
dozen
men
got
together
in
paris
and
started
talking
about
all
men
being
equal
and
free
that
led
people
all
over
france
to
start
slaughtering
and
drowning
each
other
these
people
killed
the
king
and
many
others
at
the
same
time
there
was
in
france
a
man
of
geniusnapoleon
he
defeated
everybody
everywherethat
is
he
killed
a
lot
of
peoplebecause
he
was
a
great
genius
and
he
went
off
for
some
reason
to
kill
africans
and
he
killed
them
so
well
and
was
so
cunning
and
clever
that
on
coming
back
to
france
he
ordered
everybody
to
obey
him
and
everybody
obeyed
him
having
become
emperor
he
again
went
to
kill
people
in
italy
austria
and
prussia
and
there
he
killed
a
lot
in
russia
there
was
the
emperor
alexander
who
decided
to
restore
order
in
europe
and
therefore
made
war
with
napoleon
but
in
the
year
seven
he
suddenly
made
friends
with
him
then
in
the
year
eleven
quarreled
again
and
again
they
started
killing
a
lot
of
people
and
napoleon
brought
six
hundred
thousand
men
to
russia
and
captured
moscow
then
he
suddenly
ran
away
from
moscow
and
then
the
emperor
alexander
helped
by
the
advice
of
stein
and
others
united
europe
to
take
up
arms
against
the
disturber
of
its
peace
all
napoleons
allies
suddenly
became
his
enemies
and
this
armed
force
marched
against
napoleon
who
had
gathered
new
forces
the
allies
defeated
napoleon
entered
paris
made
napoleon
abdicate
and
exiled
him
to
the
island
of
elba
not
depriving
him
of
the
dignity
of
emperor
and
showing
him
every
respect
though
five
years
earlier
and
one
year
later
everybody
considered
him
a
bandit
and
outlaw
and
so
began
the
reign
of
louis
xviii
whom
until
then
both
the
french
and
the
allies
had
only
laughed
at
napoleon
pouring
out
tears
before
his
old
guard
abdicated
and
went
into
exile
then
skillful
statesmen
and
diplomats
in
particular
talleyrand
who
managed
to
sit
in
a
certain
chair
before
anyone
else
and
thereby
extended
the
borders
of
france
talked
in
vienna
and
with
these
talks
made
people
happy
or
unhappy
suddenly
the
diplomats
and
monarchs
nearly
quarreled
they
were
already
prepared
to
order
their
troops
to
kill
each
other
again
but
at
that
moment
napoleon
arrived
in
france
with
a
battalion
and
the
french
who
hated
him
all
submitted
to
him
at
once
but
the
allied
monarchs
were
angered
by
that
and
again
went
to
war
with
the
french
and
the
genius
napoleon
was
defeated
and
taken
to
the
island
of
st
helena
having
suddenly
been
recognized
as
a
bandit
and
there
the
exile
separated
from
those
dear
to
his
heart
and
from
his
beloved
france
died
a
slow
death
on
the
rock
and
bequeathed
his
great
deeds
to
posterity
but
in
europe
there
was
the
reaction
and
the
sovereigns
all
started
mistreating
their
own
people
again
it
would
be
wrong
to
think
that
this
is
a
mockery
a
caricature
of
historical
descriptions
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
mildest
expression
of
those
answers
contradictory
and
answering
no
questions
which
are
given
by
all
history
from
the
composers
of
memoirs
and
histories
of
separate
states
to
general
histories
and
the
new
genre
of
histories
of
the
culture
of
that
time
the
strangeness
and
comicality
of
these
answers
come
from
the
fact
that
modern
history
is
like
a
deaf
man
answering
questions
that
no
one
has
asked
him
if
the
aim
of
history
is
to
describe
the
movements
of
mankind
and
of
peoples
then
the
first
question
without
answering
which
the
rest
will
remain
incomprehensible
is
the
following
what
force
moves
peoples
to
this
question
modern
history
anxiously
tells
us
either
that
napoleon
was
a
great
genius
or
that
louis
xiv
was
very
proud
or
else
that
the
writers
soandso
wrote
suchandsuch
books
all
that
may
very
well
be
and
mankind
is
ready
to
agree
with
it
but
it
is
not
asking
about
that
all
that
might
be
interesting
if
we
recognized
the
divine
power
based
on
itself
and
always
the
same
that
governs
its
peoples
through
napoleons
louis
and
writers
but
we
do
not
recognize
that
power
and
therefore
before
talking
about
napoleons
louis
and
writers
we
must
show
the
existing
connection
between
these
persons
and
the
movement
of
peoples
if
in
place
of
divine
power
there
stands
another
force
then
what
this
force
consists
in
must
be
explained
for
the
whole
interest
of
history
is
contained
precisely
in
that
force
history
seems
to
suppose
that
this
force
goes
without
saying
and
is
known
to
everyone
but
despite
all
the
desire
to
take
this
new
force
as
a
known
thing
anyone
who
reads
through
very
many
historical
works
will
involuntarily
doubt
that
this
new
force
variously
understood
by
the
historians
themselves
is
well
known
to
everyone
ii
what
force
moves
peoples
specialized
biographical
historians
and
historians
of
separate
peoples
understand
this
force
as
the
force
inherent
in
heroes
and
rulers
in
their
descriptions
events
are
produced
solely
by
the
will
of
the
napoleons
the
alexanders
or
generally
of
those
persons
the
specialized
historian
is
describing
the
answers
given
by
this
sort
of
historian
to
the
question
of
the
force
that
moves
events
are
satisfactory
but
only
so
long
as
there
is
one
historian
for
each
event
but
once
historians
of
different
nationalities
and
views
begin
to
describe
the
same
event
the
answers
they
give
immediately
lose
all
meaning
because
each
of
them
understands
this
force
not
only
differently
but
often
in
a
totally
opposite
way
one
historian
insists
that
the
event
was
produced
by
the
power
of
napoleon
another
insists
that
it
was
produced
by
the
power
of
alexander
a
third
by
the
power
of
some
third
person
besides
that
historians
of
this
sort
contradict
one
another
even
in
explaining
that
force
on
which
the
power
of
one
and
the
same
person
is
based
thiers
a
bonapartist
says
that
napoleons
power
was
based
on
his
virtue
and
genius
lanfrey
a
republican
says
it
was
based
on
his
swindling
and
on
duping
the
people
so
that
historians
of
this
sort
by
mutually
demolishing
each
others
propositions
thereby
demolish
the
concept
of
the
force
that
produces
events
and
give
no
answer
to
the
essential
question
of
history
general
historians
who
deal
with
all
peoples
seem
to
recognize
the
incorrectness
of
the
specialized
historians
view
of
the
force
that
produces
events
they
do
not
recognize
this
force
as
the
power
inherent
in
heroes
and
rulers
but
as
the
result
of
many
variously
directed
forces
in
describing
a
war
or
the
subjugation
of
a
people
the
general
historian
seeks
the
cause
of
an
event
not
in
the
power
of
one
person
but
in
the
interaction
of
many
persons
connected
with
the
event
according
to
this
view
it
seems
that
the
power
of
historical
figures
conceived
as
the
result
of
many
forces
cannot
be
considered
a
force
itself
productive
of
events
yet
general
historians
in
most
cases
happen
to
use
the
concept
of
power
once
again
as
a
force
in
itself
productive
of
events
and
related
to
them
as
a
cause
by
their
account
a
historical
figure
is
now
the
product
of
his
time
and
his
power
is
only
the
product
of
various
forces
now
his
power
is
a
force
productive
of
events
gervinus
schlosser
and
others
for
example
now
prove
that
napoleon
was
a
product
of
the
revolution
of
the
ideas
of
1789
and
so
on
and
now
say
outright
that
the
campaign
of
the
year
twelve
and
other
events
they
do
not
like
are
only
products
of
napoleons
misdirected
will
and
that
those
same
ideas
of
1789
were
stopped
in
their
development
as
a
result
of
napoleons
despotism
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
the
general
state
of
mind
produced
the
power
of
napoleon
the
power
of
napoleon
suppressed
the
ideas
of
the
revolution
and
the
general
state
of
mind
this
strange
contradiction
is
not
accidental
not
only
is
it
encountered
at
every
step
but
all
the
descriptions
of
the
general
historians
are
made
up
of
a
consecutive
series
of
such
contradictions
this
contradiction
comes
from
the
fact
that
having
entered
upon
the
path
of
analysis
the
general
historians
stop
halfway
to
find
the
component
forces
equal
to
a
composite
or
resultant
it
is
necessary
that
the
sum
of
the
components
equal
the
composite
this
condition
is
never
observed
by
general
historians
and
therefore
in
order
to
explain
the
resultant
force
they
must
necessarily
allow
for
an
unexplained
force
besides
the
insufficient
components
which
acts
upon
the
composite
the
specialized
historian
describing
the
campaign
of
the
year
thirteen
or
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
says
directly
that
these
events
were
produced
by
the
will
of
alexander
but
the
general
historian
gervinus
disproving
this
view
of
the
specialized
historian
aims
to
show
that
the
campaign
of
the
year
thirteen
and
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
had
as
their
causes
besides
the
will
of
alexander
the
activity
of
stein
metternich
mme
de
sta235l
talleyrand
fichte
chateaubriand
and
others
the
historian
has
obviously
broken
down
the
power
of
alexander
into
its
components
talleyrand
chateaubriand
and
so
on
the
sum
of
these
components
that
is
the
mutual
influence
on
each
other
of
chateaubriand
talleyrand
mme
de
sta235l
and
others
obviously
does
not
equal
the
whole
resultant
that
is
the
phenomenon
that
millions
of
frenchmen
submitted
to
the
bourbons
from
the
fact
that
chateaubriand
mme
de
sta235l
and
others
said
suchandsuch
words
to
each
other
there
follows
only
their
relations
among
themselves
not
the
submission
of
millions
and
therefore
in
order
to
explain
in
what
way
the
submission
of
millions
followed
from
their
relations
that
is
how
from
components
equal
to
one
a
there
followed
a
resultant
equal
to
a
thousand
times
a
the
historian
must
necessarily
allow
again
for
the
same
force
of
the
power
which
he
denies
recognizing
it
as
the
result
of
forces
that
is
he
must
allow
for
the
unexplained
force
acting
upon
the
composite
this
is
what
general
historians
do
and
consequently
they
contradict
not
only
the
specialized
historians
but
also
themselves
country
dwellers
having
no
clear
concept
of
what
causes
rain
say
depending
on
whether
they
would
like
to
have
rain
or
fair
weather
the
wind
has
scattered
the
clouds
the
wind
has
gathered
the
clouds
it
is
the
same
with
general
historians
sometimes
when
they
want
to
when
it
suits
their
theory
they
say
that
power
is
the
result
of
events
and
sometimes
when
they
need
to
prove
something
else
they
say
that
power
produces
events
the
third
sort
of
historians
known
as
historians
of
culture
following
the
path
laid
down
by
the
general
historians
who
sometimes
recognize
writers
and
ladies
as
forces
productive
of
events
understand
this
force
quite
differently
still
they
see
it
in
socalled
culture
in
intellectual
activity
historians
of
culture
are
perfectly
consistent
in
relation
to
their
progenitors
the
general
historians
for
if
historical
events
can
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
certain
people
had
suchandsuch
relations
with
each
other
then
why
not
explain
them
by
the
fact
that
suchandsuch
people
wrote
suchandsuch
books
these
historians
select
from
among
the
enormous
number
of
symptoms
that
accompany
any
living
phenomenon
the
symptom
of
intellectual
activity
and
say
that
this
symptom
is
the
cause
but
despite
all
their
attempts
to
show
that
the
cause
of
an
event
lay
in
intellectual
activity
only
with
great
flexibility
can
one
agree
that
there
is
something
in
common
between
intellectual
activity
and
the
movement
of
peoples
but
in
no
case
is
it
possible
to
allow
that
intellectual
activity
guides
the
activity
of
people
for
such
phenomena
as
the
cruelest
murders
of
the
french
revolution
resulting
from
the
preaching
of
the
equality
of
man
and
the
wickedest
wars
and
executions
resulting
from
the
preaching
of
love
do
not
confirm
this
supposition
but
even
allowing
that
all
the
cleverly
woven
arguments
which
fill
these
histories
are
correct
allowing
that
peoples
are
governed
by
some
indefinable
force
known
as
an
ideathe
essential
question
of
history
either
remains
unanswered
or
to
the
former
power
of
monarchs
and
to
the
influence
of
advisers
and
other
persons
introduced
by
the
general
historians
there
is
joined
yet
another
new
force
the
idea
the
connection
of
which
with
the
masses
calls
for
explanation
it
is
possible
to
understand
that
napoleon
had
power
and
therefore
an
event
took
place
with
some
flexibility
it
is
possible
to
understand
that
napoleon
along
with
other
forces
was
the
cause
of
an
event
but
in
what
way
the
book
le
contrat
social
brought
it
about
that
the
french
started
drowning
each
other
cannot
be
understood
without
explaining
the
causal
connection
of
this
new
force
with
the
event
undoubtedly
there
exists
a
connection
among
all
that
is
alive
at
the
same
time
and
therefore
it
is
possible
to
find
a
certain
connection
between
the
intellectual
activity
of
a
people
and
their
historical
movement
just
as
this
connection
can
be
found
between
the
movement
of
mankind
and
trade
crafts
gardening
or
anything
you
like
but
why
the
intellectual
activity
of
people
is
presented
by
historians
of
culture
as
the
cause
or
expression
of
the
whole
historical
movement
is
hard
to
understand
only
the
following
considerations
could
lead
historians
to
such
a
conclusion
1
that
history
is
written
by
scholars
and
therefore
it
is
natural
and
pleasant
for
them
to
think
that
the
activity
of
their
estate
is
the
basis
for
the
movement
of
all
mankind
just
as
it
is
natural
and
pleasant
for
merchants
farmers
and
soldiers
to
think
so
this
does
not
get
expressed
only
because
merchants
and
soldiers
do
not
write
history
and
2
that
spiritual
activity
education
civilization
culture
the
idea
are
all
vague
indefinite
concepts
under
the
banner
of
which
it
is
quite
convenient
to
use
words
that
have
a
still
less
clear
meaning
and
therefore
can
easily
be
plugged
into
any
theory
but
not
to
speak
of
the
inner
merit
of
histories
of
this
sort
perhaps
they
are
even
needed
by
someone
or
for
something
the
histories
of
culture
which
all
general
histories
are
beginning
to
come
down
to
more
and
more
are
remarkable
in
that
while
thoroughly
and
seriously
analyzing
various
religious
philosophical
and
political
teachings
as
causes
of
events
each
time
they
have
only
to
describe
an
actual
historical
eventfor
example
the
campaign
of
the
year
twelvethey
describe
it
involuntarily
as
a
product
of
power
saying
outright
that
this
campaign
is
the
product
of
napoleons
will
in
speaking
this
way
the
historians
of
culture
involuntarily
contradict
themselves
or
prove
that
the
new
force
they
have
invented
does
not
express
historical
events
and
that
the
sole
means
of
understanding
history
is
that
power
which
they
supposedly
do
not
recognize
iii
a
locomotive
is
moving
someone
asks
why
does
it
move
a
muzhik
says
the
devil
moves
it
another
man
says
the
locomotive
moves
because
its
wheels
turn
a
third
asserts
that
the
cause
of
the
movement
is
the
smoke
blown
away
by
the
wind
the
muzhik
is
irrefutable
in
order
to
refute
him
someone
would
have
to
prove
to
him
that
there
is
no
devil
or
another
muzhik
would
have
to
explain
to
him
that
it
is
not
the
devil
but
a
german
who
moves
the
locomotive
only
then
by
way
of
contradiction
will
they
see
that
they
are
both
wrong
but
the
one
who
says
that
the
cause
is
the
turning
of
the
wheels
refutes
himself
because
if
he
enters
upon
the
terrain
of
analysis
he
must
keep
going
he
must
explain
the
cause
of
the
turning
of
the
wheels
and
until
he
arrives
at
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
locomotives
movement
the
steam
compressed
in
the
boiler
he
will
have
no
right
to
stop
in
his
search
for
the
cause
the
one
who
explained
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
by
the
smoke
blown
back
noticing
that
the
explanation
by
the
wheels
did
not
furnish
the
cause
took
the
first
symptom
that
came
along
and
in
his
turn
passed
it
on
as
the
cause
the
only
concept
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
is
the
concept
of
a
force
equal
to
its
visible
movement
the
only
concept
by
means
of
which
the
movement
of
peoples
can
be
explained
is
the
concept
of
a
force
equal
to
the
whole
movement
of
the
peoples
yet
under
this
concept
different
historians
understand
completely
different
forces
none
of
them
equal
to
the
visible
movement
some
see
it
as
a
force
immediately
inherent
in
heroeslike
the
muzhik
who
sees
the
devil
in
a
locomotive
others
as
a
force
produced
by
certain
other
forceslike
the
turning
of
the
wheels
still
others
as
an
intellectual
influencelike
the
blownaway
smoke
as
long
as
histories
of
separate
persons
are
writtenbe
they
caesars
alexanders
or
luthers
and
voltairesand
not
the
history
of
all
the
people
all
without
a
single
exception
who
participate
in
an
event
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
describe
the
movement
of
mankind
without
the
concept
of
a
force
that
makes
people
direct
their
activity
towards
a
single
goal
and
the
only
such
concept
known
to
historians
is
power
this
concept
is
the
one
handle
by
means
of
which
the
material
of
history
can
be
mastered
in
todays
accounting
of
it
and
he
who
breaks
off
that
handle
as
buckle
did
without
having
learned
any
other
method
of
dealing
with
historical
material
only
deprives
himself
of
the
last
possibility
of
dealing
with
it
the
inevitability
of
the
concept
of
power
for
the
explanation
of
historical
phenomena
is
proved
best
of
all
by
the
general
historians
and
historians
of
culture
themselves
who
allegedly
renounce
the
concept
of
power
and
inevitably
make
use
of
it
at
every
step
up
to
now
in
relation
to
the
question
of
mankind
historical
science
has
been
like
circulating
moneypaper
and
coin
biographies
and
histories
of
separate
peoples
are
like
paper
money
they
pass
and
circulate
fulfilling
their
purpose
without
harming
anyone
and
even
being
useful
until
the
question
arises
of
what
backs
them
up
we
need
only
forget
the
question
of
how
the
will
of
heroes
produces
events
and
the
histories
of
thiers
will
be
interesting
instructive
and
besides
that
will
acquire
a
tinge
of
poetry
but
just
as
doubt
of
the
actual
value
of
paper
money
will
arise
either
because
as
it
is
so
easy
to
make
a
great
deal
of
it
will
be
made
or
because
people
will
want
to
exchange
it
for
goldin
just
the
same
way
doubt
arises
about
the
actual
meaning
of
histories
of
this
sort
either
because
too
many
of
them
appear
or
because
someone
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
will
ask
by
what
force
did
napoleon
do
thatthat
is
will
want
to
exchange
paper
currency
for
the
pure
gold
of
actual
understanding
general
historians
and
historians
of
culture
are
like
people
who
having
recognized
the
inconvenience
of
paper
money
decide
instead
to
make
coins
out
of
a
metal
that
lacks
the
density
of
gold
and
the
money
will
indeed
come
out
having
the
clink
of
coin
but
only
the
clink
paper
money
might
still
deceive
the
unknowing
whereas
a
coin
that
clinks
but
has
no
value
will
deceive
no
one
as
gold
is
only
gold
when
it
can
be
used
not
for
exchange
alone
but
also
for
real
things
so
too
general
historians
will
only
be
gold
when
they
are
able
to
answer
the
essential
question
of
history
what
is
power
the
general
historians
answer
this
question
contradictorily
and
the
historians
of
culture
push
it
aside
altogether
answering
something
else
and
as
tokens
that
resemble
gold
can
only
be
used
among
a
group
of
people
who
agree
to
take
them
for
gold
and
among
those
who
do
not
know
the
properties
of
gold
so
too
general
historians
and
historians
of
culture
without
answering
the
essential
questions
of
mankind
for
some
sort
of
purposes
of
their
own
serve
as
current
money
for
the
universities
and
the
mass
of
readerslovers
of
serious
books
as
they
put
it
iv
having
renounced
the
view
of
the
ancients
on
the
divine
submission
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
a
chosen
one
and
on
the
submission
of
that
will
to
a
divinity
history
cannot
take
a
single
step
without
contradiction
unless
it
chooses
one
of
two
things
either
to
return
to
the
former
faith
in
the
direct
participation
of
the
divinity
in
the
affairs
of
mankind
or
to
explain
definitely
the
meaning
of
that
force
productive
of
historical
events
which
is
known
as
power
to
return
to
the
first
is
impossible
belief
has
been
destroyed
and
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
explain
the
meaning
of
power
napoleon
gave
orders
to
gather
troops
and
go
to
war
we
are
so
accustomed
to
this
notion
we
have
grown
so
used
to
this
view
that
the
question
of
why
six
hundred
thousand
men
go
to
war
when
napoleon
says
suchandsuch
words
seems
senseless
to
us
he
had
power
and
therefore
what
he
ordered
was
done
this
answer
is
perfectly
satisfactory
if
we
believe
that
power
was
given
to
him
from
god
but
as
soon
as
we
do
not
acknowledge
that
it
becomes
necessary
to
define
what
this
power
of
one
man
over
others
is
this
power
cannot
be
the
direct
power
of
physical
domination
of
a
strong
being
over
a
weak
a
domination
based
on
the
application
or
threat
of
the
application
of
physical
force
like
the
power
of
hercules
nor
can
it
be
based
on
the
domination
of
moral
force
as
some
historians
think
in
the
simplicity
of
their
hearts
when
they
say
that
historical
figures
are
heroes
that
is
men
endowed
with
a
special
force
of
soul
and
mind
which
is
called
genius
this
power
cannot
be
based
on
the
domination
of
moral
force
for
not
to
speak
of
heroic
men
like
napoleon
about
whose
moral
virtues
opinions
differ
greatly
history
shows
us
that
neither
the
louis
xis
nor
the
metternichs
who
ruled
over
millions
of
people
had
any
special
qualities
of
spiritual
force
but
were
on
the
contrary
for
the
most
weaker
than
each
of
the
millions
of
people
they
ruled
over
if
the
source
of
power
lies
neither
in
the
physical
nor
in
the
moral
qualities
of
the
person
who
possesses
it
then
it
is
obvious
that
the
source
of
this
power
must
be
found
outside
this
personin
those
relations
to
the
masses
in
which
the
person
who
possesses
power
finds
himself
that
is
exactly
how
power
is
understood
by
jurisprudence
that
money
changer
of
history
which
promises
to
exchange
the
historical
understanding
of
power
for
pure
gold
power
is
the
sum
total
of
the
wills
of
the
masses
transferred
by
express
or
tacit
agreement
to
rulers
chosen
by
the
masses
in
the
domain
of
jurisprudence
which
consists
of
arguments
about
how
the
state
and
power
must
be
organized
if
all
that
can
be
organized
this
is
all
very
clear
but
when
applied
to
history
this
definition
of
power
calls
for
elucidation
jurisprudence
considers
the
state
and
power
as
the
ancients
considered
fireas
something
absolutely
existent
but
for
history
the
state
and
power
are
only
phenomena
just
as
for
presentday
physics
fire
is
not
an
element
but
a
phenomenon
from
this
fundamental
difference
between
the
views
of
history
and
of
jurisprudence
comes
the
fact
that
jurisprudence
can
speak
in
detail
of
how
in
its
opinion
power
must
be
organized
and
what
power
is
existing
immutably
outside
time
but
to
historical
questions
about
the
meaning
of
power
as
it
changes
in
time
it
can
give
no
answer
if
power
is
the
transfer
of
the
sum
total
of
wills
to
a
ruler
then
is
pugachev
a
representative
of
the
wills
of
the
masses
if
he
is
not
then
why
is
napoleon
i
why
was
napoleon
iii
a
criminal
when
he
was
caught
in
boulogne
while
later
the
criminals
were
the
ones
he
caught
during
palace
revolutions
in
which
two
or
three
men
sometimes
take
part
is
the
will
of
the
masses
also
transferred
to
a
new
person
in
international
relations
is
the
will
of
the
popular
masses
transferred
to
their
conqueror
was
the
will
of
the
confederation
of
the
rhine
transferred
to
napoleon
in
1808
was
the
will
of
the
mass
of
the
russian
people
transferred
to
napoleon
in
1809
when
our
troops
in
alliance
with
the
french
went
to
make
war
on
austria
these
questions
can
be
answered
in
three
ways
either
1
by
recognizing
that
the
will
of
the
masses
is
always
unconditionally
handed
over
to
a
ruler
or
rulers
whom
they
have
chosen
and
that
therefore
any
rise
of
a
new
power
any
struggle
against
the
power
once
handed
over
should
be
considered
only
as
a
violation
of
the
real
power
or
2
by
recognizing
that
the
will
of
the
masses
is
transferred
to
a
ruler
conditionally
under
definite
and
known
conditions
and
by
showing
that
all
constraints
clashes
and
even
destructions
of
power
come
from
the
nonobservation
by
the
rulers
of
the
conditions
under
which
power
was
transferred
to
them
or
3
by
recognizing
that
the
will
of
the
masses
is
transferred
to
a
ruler
conditionally
but
under
unknown
undefined
conditions
and
that
the
rise
of
many
powers
their
struggle
and
their
fall
come
only
from
the
greater
or
lesser
degree
to
which
the
rulers
fulfill
those
unknown
conditions
under
which
the
wills
of
the
masses
are
transferred
from
some
persons
to
others
and
these
are
the
three
ways
in
which
historians
explain
the
relations
of
the
masses
to
the
rulers
some
historians
not
understanding
in
the
simplicity
of
their
hearts
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
power
those
same
specialized
and
biographical
historians
of
whom
we
have
spoken
above
seem
to
recognize
that
the
sum
total
of
the
wills
of
the
masses
is
transferred
to
historical
figures
unconditionally
and
therefore
while
describing
some
one
power
these
historians
suppose
that
that
same
power
alone
is
absolute
and
real
and
that
any
other
force
opposing
that
real
power
is
not
power
but
a
breach
of
powerviolence
their
theory
fit
for
primitive
and
peaceful
periods
of
history
when
applied
to
complex
and
stormy
periods
in
the
life
of
peoples
during
which
various
powers
arise
simultaneously
and
struggle
with
each
other
has
the
inconvenience
that
a
legitimist
historian
will
prove
that
the
convention
the
directoire
and
bonaparte
were
only
breaches
of
power
while
a
republican
and
bonapartist
will
provethe
one
that
the
convention
and
the
other
that
the
empire
was
the
real
power
and
that
all
the
rest
were
breaches
of
power
it
is
obvious
that
the
explanations
of
power
by
these
historians
mutually
refuting
each
other
in
this
fashion
can
be
fit
only
for
children
of
the
most
tender
age
recognizing
the
falseness
of
this
view
of
history
another
sort
of
historian
says
that
power
is
based
on
the
conditional
handing
over
to
rulers
of
the
sum
total
of
the
wills
of
the
masses
and
that
historical
figures
have
power
only
on
condition
of
carrying
out
the
program
which
the
will
of
the
people
has
tacitly
agreed
to
prescribe
to
them
but
what
those
conditions
consist
in
the
historians
do
not
tell
us
or
if
they
do
they
constantly
contradict
each
other
each
historian
according
to
his
view
of
what
constitutes
the
goal
of
the
movement
of
a
people
sees
those
conditions
as
the
greatness
wealth
freedom
enlightenment
of
the
citizens
of
france
or
some
other
state
but
to
say
nothing
of
the
contradictions
of
historians
as
to
what
those
conditions
are
even
allowing
for
the
existence
of
a
single
program
of
those
conditions
common
to
all
we
will
find
that
the
historical
facts
almost
always
contradict
this
theory
if
the
conditions
under
which
power
is
handed
over
consist
in
wealth
freedom
enlightenment
of
the
people
then
why
do
a
louis
xiv
and
an
ivan
the
terrible
quietly
live
out
their
reigns
while
a
louis
xvi
and
a
charles
i
are
executed
by
their
people
to
this
question
the
historians
answer
that
the
activity
of
louis
xiv
being
contrary
to
the
program
affected
louis
xvi
but
why
did
it
not
affect
louis
xiv
and
xv
why
did
it
affect
precisely
louis
xvi
and
what
is
the
term
of
this
effect
to
these
questions
there
neither
are
nor
can
be
any
answers
equally
little
explanation
is
given
by
this
view
of
the
reason
why
the
sum
total
of
wills
is
not
transferred
from
its
rulers
and
their
successors
for
several
centuries
but
then
suddenly
in
the
course
of
fifty
years
is
transferred
to
the
convention
the
directoire
napoleon
alexander
louis
xviii
again
to
napoleon
to
charles
x
to
louis
philippe
to
the
republican
government
to
napoleon
iii
while
explaining
these
quickly
occurring
transfers
of
wills
from
one
figure
to
another
especially
to
do
with
international
relations
conquests
and
alliances
these
historians
must
involuntarily
recognize
that
these
phenomena
are
not
regular
transfers
of
wills
but
accidents
depending
now
on
cunning
now
on
error
or
perfidy
or
the
weakness
of
a
diplomat
or
a
monarch
or
a
party
leader
so
that
the
majority
of
historical
phenomenacivil
wars
revolutions
conquestsare
presented
by
these
historians
not
as
the
results
of
transfers
of
free
wills
but
as
results
of
the
false
application
of
the
will
of
one
or
several
men
that
is
again
as
breaches
of
power
and
therefore
historical
events
of
this
sort
too
are
presented
by
historians
as
deviations
from
theory
these
historians
are
like
the
botanist
who
having
observed
that
some
plants
emerge
from
the
seed
with
two
cotyledons
would
insist
that
everything
that
grows
grows
only
by
doubling
itself
into
two
leaves
and
that
a
palm
and
a
mushroom
and
even
an
oak
branching
out
in
its
full
growth
and
no
longer
having
any
resemblance
to
two
leaves
deviate
from
the
theory
historians
of
the
third
sort
recognize
that
the
will
of
the
masses
is
transferred
to
historical
figures
conditionally
but
that
these
conditions
are
unknown
to
us
they
say
that
historical
figures
have
power
only
because
they
carry
out
the
will
of
the
masses
transferred
to
them
but
in
that
case
if
the
force
that
moves
peoples
is
not
in
historical
figures
but
in
the
peoples
themselves
what
then
is
the
significance
of
historical
figures
historical
figures
say
these
historians
express
in
themselves
the
will
of
the
masses
the
activity
of
historical
figures
serves
to
represent
the
activity
of
the
masses
but
in
that
case
the
question
arises
does
all
the
activity
of
historical
figures
serve
to
express
the
will
of
the
masses
or
only
some
side
of
it
if
all
the
activity
of
historical
figures
serves
to
express
the
will
of
the
masses
as
some
think
then
the
biographies
of
the
napoleons
and
catherines
with
all
the
details
of
court
gossip
serve
to
express
the
life
of
the
people
which
is
an
obvious
absurdity
if
only
one
side
of
the
activity
of
a
historical
figure
serves
to
express
the
life
of
the
people
as
other
alleged
philosopherhistorians
think
then
in
order
to
determine
which
side
of
the
activity
of
a
historical
figure
expresses
the
life
of
the
people
we
must
first
know
what
the
life
of
the
people
is
running
into
this
difficulty
historians
of
this
sort
think
up
the
most
vague
intangible
and
general
abstraction
to
which
the
greatest
number
of
events
can
be
accommodated
and
say
that
this
abstraction
is
the
goal
of
the
movement
of
mankind
the
most
usual
general
abstractions
accepted
by
almost
all
historians
are
freedom
equality
enlightenment
progress
civilization
culture
having
posited
some
such
abstraction
as
the
goal
of
the
movement
of
mankind
historians
study
those
who
have
left
the
greatest
number
of
memorials
behindkings
ministers
generals
writers
reformers
popes
journaliststo
the
extent
that
all
these
figures
in
their
opinion
have
furthered
or
hindered
that
abstraction
but
since
nothing
proves
that
the
goal
of
mankind
consists
in
freedom
equality
enlightenment
or
civilization
and
since
the
connection
of
the
masses
with
the
rulers
and
enlighteners
of
mankind
is
based
only
on
the
arbitrary
assumption
that
the
sum
total
of
the
wills
of
the
masses
is
always
transferred
to
the
figures
who
are
conspicuous
for
us
the
activity
of
the
millions
of
people
who
migrate
burn
houses
abandon
farming
and
destroy
each
other
is
never
expressed
in
the
description
of
the
activity
of
a
dozen
figures
who
do
not
burn
houses
are
not
concerned
with
farming
and
do
not
kill
their
own
kind
history
proves
that
at
every
step
is
the
ferment
among
the
people
of
the
west
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
and
their
striving
towards
the
east
explained
by
the
activity
of
louis
xiv
xv
xvi
their
mistresses
and
ministers
by
the
lives
of
napoleon
rousseau
diderot
beaumarchais
and
others
is
the
movement
of
the
russian
people
to
the
east
to
kazan
and
siberia
expressed
in
the
details
of
the
morbid
character
of
ioann
iv
and
his
correspondence
with
kurbsky
is
the
movement
of
people
during
the
crusades
explained
by
studies
of
the
godefroys
and
louis
and
their
ladies
we
still
find
incomprehensible
the
movement
of
people
from
west
to
east
without
any
goal
without
leadership
with
a
crowd
of
vagabonds
with
peter
the
hermit
and
still
less
comprehensible
remains
the
ceasing
of
this
movement
once
a
reasonable
holy
purpose
for
the
campaignthe
deliverance
of
jerusalemhad
been
set
by
the
historical
actors
popes
kings
and
knights
urged
the
people
to
liberate
the
holy
land
but
the
people
did
not
go
because
the
unknown
reason
that
had
prompted
them
to
move
earlier
no
longer
existed
the
history
of
the
godefroys
and
minnesingers
obviously
cannot
contain
the
life
of
the
people
and
the
history
of
the
godefroys
and
minnesingers
has
remained
the
history
of
the
godefroys
and
minnesingers
while
the
history
of
the
life
of
the
people
and
their
motives
has
remained
unknown
still
less
will
the
history
of
writers
and
reformers
explain
the
life
of
the
people
to
us
the
history
of
culture
will
explain
to
us
the
motives
the
conditions
of
life
and
the
thought
of
a
writer
or
reformer
we
will
learn
that
luther
had
a
hot
temper
and
said
suchandsuch
things
we
will
learn
that
rousseau
was
mistrustful
and
wrote
suchandsuch
books
but
we
will
not
learn
why
after
the
reformation
the
peoples
slaughtered
each
other
and
why
during
the
french
revolution
they
executed
each
other
if
we
combine
these
two
sorts
of
history
as
modern
historians
do
we
will
get
the
history
of
monarchs
and
writers
and
not
the
history
of
the
life
of
peoples
v
the
life
of
peoples
cannot
be
contained
in
the
lives
of
several
men
for
the
connection
between
these
several
men
and
the
peoples
has
not
been
found
the
theory
that
this
connection
is
based
on
the
transfer
of
the
sum
total
of
wills
to
historical
figures
is
a
hypothesis
not
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
history
the
theory
of
the
transfer
of
the
sum
total
of
wills
of
the
masses
to
historical
figures
may
explain
a
great
deal
in
the
sphere
of
jurisprudence
and
may
be
necessary
for
its
purposes
but
in
its
application
to
history
once
revolutions
conquests
civil
wars
appear
once
history
beginsthis
theory
explains
nothing
this
theory
seems
irrefutable
precisely
because
the
act
of
transferring
the
wills
of
the
people
cannot
be
verified
since
it
never
took
place
whatever
event
takes
place
whoever
stands
at
the
head
of
the
event
the
theory
can
always
say
that
this
person
stood
at
the
head
of
the
event
because
the
sum
total
of
wills
was
transferred
to
him
the
answers
that
this
theory
gives
to
historical
questions
are
like
the
answers
of
a
man
who
looking
at
a
moving
herd
and
taking
no
account
either
of
the
quality
of
pasture
in
different
parts
of
the
field
or
the
urgings
of
the
herdsman
would
judge
the
reasons
for
this
or
that
direction
of
the
herd
by
which
animal
is
at
the
head
of
the
herd
the
herd
is
going
in
this
direction
because
the
animal
at
the
head
of
it
is
leading
it
and
the
sum
total
of
wills
of
all
the
rest
of
the
animals
is
transferred
to
this
ruler
of
the
herd
so
answers
the
first
category
of
historians
who
recognize
the
absolute
transfer
of
power
if
the
animals
at
the
head
of
the
herd
change
that
happens
because
the
sum
total
of
wills
of
all
the
animals
is
transferred
from
one
ruler
to
another
depending
on
whether
he
leads
the
herd
in
the
direction
the
entire
herd
has
chosen
so
answer
the
historians
who
recognize
that
the
sum
total
of
wills
of
the
masses
is
transferred
to
the
rulers
under
conditions
which
they
consider
known
given
this
method
of
observation
it
quite
often
happens
that
the
observer
depending
on
the
direction
chosen
by
the
herd
considers
animals
as
leaders
who
as
a
result
of
a
change
in
the
direction
of
the
masses
are
no
longer
in
front
but
on
the
side
and
sometimes
behind
if
the
animals
at
the
head
change
constantly
and
the
direction
of
the
entire
herd
changes
constantly
that
happens
because
to
attain
the
direction
which
is
known
to
us
the
animals
hand
over
their
wills
to
animals
that
are
conspicuous
to
us
and
thus
in
order
to
study
the
movement
of
the
herd
we
must
observe
all
the
conspicuous
animals
going
on
all
sides
of
the
herd
so
speak
historians
of
the
third
category
who
recognize
all
historical
figures
from
monarchs
to
journalists
as
expressive
of
their
time
the
theory
of
the
transfer
of
the
will
of
the
masses
to
historical
figures
is
only
a
paraphraseonly
an
expression
of
the
words
of
the
question
in
different
words
what
is
the
cause
of
historical
events
power
what
is
power
power
is
the
sum
total
of
wills
transferred
to
one
person
on
what
condition
are
the
wills
of
the
masses
transferred
to
one
person
on
condition
that
the
person
express
the
will
of
the
whole
people
that
is
power
is
power
that
is
power
is
a
word
the
meaning
of
which
we
do
not
understand
if
the
domain
of
human
knowledge
were
limited
to
abstract
thinking
alone
then
having
subjected
the
explanation
of
power
given
by
science
to
criticism
mankind
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that
power
is
only
a
word
and
does
not
exist
in
reality
but
for
the
apprehending
of
phenomena
besides
abstract
thinking
man
has
the
tool
of
experience
with
which
he
verifies
the
results
of
thinking
and
experience
says
that
power
is
not
a
word
but
an
actually
existing
phenomenon
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
without
the
concept
of
power
no
description
of
the
sum
total
of
human
activity
is
possible
the
existence
of
power
is
proved
by
history
as
well
as
by
the
observation
of
contemporary
events
whenever
an
event
takes
place
a
man
or
men
always
appear
by
whose
will
the
event
appears
to
take
place
napoleon
iii
gives
the
command
and
the
french
go
to
mexico
the
king
of
prussia
and
bismarck
give
the
command
and
troops
go
to
bohemia
napoleon
i
gives
the
order
and
troops
go
to
russia
alexander
i
gives
the
order
and
the
french
submit
to
the
bourbons
experience
shows
us
that
whenever
an
event
takes
place
it
is
always
connected
with
the
will
of
one
or
several
persons
who
have
ordered
it
historians
from
the
old
habit
of
acknowledging
divine
participation
in
human
affairs
want
to
see
the
cause
of
an
event
in
the
expression
of
the
will
of
the
person
invested
with
power
but
that
conclusion
is
confirmed
neither
by
reasoning
nor
by
experience
on
the
one
hand
reasoning
shows
that
the
expression
of
the
will
of
man
in
words
is
only
the
general
activity
expressed
in
an
event
such
as
a
war
or
a
revolution
and
therefore
without
recognizing
an
incomprehensible
supernatural
forcea
miracleit
is
impossible
to
allow
that
words
could
be
the
immediate
cause
of
the
movement
of
millions
on
the
other
hand
even
if
we
allow
that
words
can
be
the
cause
of
an
event
history
shows
that
the
expression
of
the
will
of
historical
figures
in
the
majority
of
cases
produces
no
effect
at
all
that
is
that
their
orders
often
are
not
only
not
carried
out
but
that
sometimes
what
takes
place
is
even
the
opposite
of
what
they
ordered
unless
we
allow
for
divine
participation
in
human
affairs
we
cannot
take
power
as
the
cause
of
events
power
from
the
point
of
view
of
experience
is
only
the
dependence
that
exists
between
the
expression
of
a
persons
will
and
the
carrying
out
of
that
will
by
other
people
in
order
to
explain
the
conditions
of
that
dependence
to
ourselves
we
must
first
of
all
restore
the
concept
of
the
expression
of
will
referring
it
to
man
and
not
to
a
divinity
if
a
divinity
gives
an
order
expresses
its
will
as
the
history
of
the
ancients
shows
us
the
expression
of
that
will
does
not
depend
on
time
and
is
not
caused
by
anything
since
the
divinity
is
in
no
way
connected
with
the
event
but
speaking
of
orders
as
the
expression
of
the
will
of
people
who
act
in
time
and
are
connected
among
themselves
we
should
restore
so
as
to
explain
to
ourselves
the
connection
of
orders
with
events
1
the
condition
of
all
that
takes
placethe
continuity
of
the
movement
in
time
both
of
events
and
of
the
person
who
gives
orders
and
2
the
condition
of
the
necessary
connection
of
the
person
who
gives
orders
to
the
people
who
carry
out
his
orders
vi
only
the
expression
of
the
will
of
a
divinity
not
dependent
on
time
can
pertain
to
a
whole
series
of
events
that
are
to
take
place
over
several
years
or
centuries
and
only
a
divinity
without
cause
by
its
will
alone
can
determine
the
direction
of
mankinds
movement
man
acts
in
time
and
himself
participates
in
events
in
restoring
the
first
omitted
conditionthe
condition
of
timewe
will
see
that
not
a
single
order
can
be
carried
out
without
the
existence
of
a
previous
order
that
makes
possible
the
carrying
out
of
the
later
one
never
does
a
single
order
appear
spontaneously
and
not
include
in
itself
a
whole
series
of
events
but
each
order
follows
from
another
and
never
pertains
to
a
whole
series
of
events
but
always
only
to
one
moment
of
the
event
when
we
say
for
instance
that
napoleon
ordered
the
army
to
go
to
war
we
unite
into
one
simultaneously
expressed
order
a
series
of
consecutive
orders
dependent
on
each
other
napoleon
could
not
order
a
campaign
against
russia
and
never
did
today
he
ordered
suchandsuch
papers
written
to
vienna
berlin
and
petersburg
tomorrow
suchandsuch
decrees
and
orders
to
the
army
the
fleet
the
commissariat
and
so
on
and
so
forthmillions
of
orders
which
formed
a
series
of
orders
corresponding
to
a
series
of
events
which
brought
french
troops
to
russia
if
napoleon
throughout
his
reign
keeps
giving
orders
about
the
expedition
to
england
expends
more
effort
and
time
on
it
than
on
any
other
of
his
undertakings
and
despite
that
throughout
his
reign
never
once
attempts
to
carry
out
his
intention
but
makes
an
expedition
to
russia
with
which
by
his
more
than
once
expressed
conviction
he
considers
it
more
advantageous
to
be
in
alliance
this
happens
because
the
first
series
of
orders
did
not
correspond
to
a
series
of
events
and
the
second
series
of
orders
did
to
be
certain
that
an
order
will
be
carried
out
one
must
give
such
orders
as
can
be
carried
out
but
to
know
what
can
and
cannot
be
carried
out
is
impossible
not
only
for
napoleons
campaign
in
russia
in
which
millions
take
part
but
even
for
the
most
uncomplicated
event
because
the
carrying
out
of
the
one
and
the
other
can
always
meet
with
millions
of
obstacles
each
order
carried
out
is
always
one
of
a
great
many
that
are
not
carried
out
all
the
impossible
orders
are
not
connected
with
the
event
and
are
not
carried
out
only
those
that
are
possible
are
connected
in
a
consecutive
series
of
orders
that
correspond
to
a
series
of
events
and
are
carried
out
our
false
notion
that
the
order
that
precedes
an
event
is
the
cause
of
the
event
comes
from
the
fact
that
once
an
event
has
taken
place
and
out
of
thousands
of
orders
only
those
connected
with
the
event
were
carried
out
we
forget
about
those
that
were
not
because
they
could
not
be
carried
out
besides
the
chief
source
of
our
error
in
this
sense
comes
from
the
fact
that
in
a
historical
account
a
whole
series
of
countless
diverse
minuscule
events
such
as
all
that
brought
french
troops
to
russia
is
generalized
into
one
event
according
to
the
result
this
series
of
events
produced
and
in
correspondence
with
this
generalization
the
whole
series
of
orders
is
also
generalized
into
one
expression
of
will
we
say
napoleon
wanted
to
and
did
campaign
against
russia
in
reality
we
will
never
find
in
all
the
activity
of
napoleon
anything
resembling
the
expression
of
such
a
will
but
we
will
see
the
series
of
orders
or
expressions
of
his
will
directed
in
the
most
diverse
and
indefinite
way
out
of
a
countless
series
of
napoleons
orders
that
were
not
carried
out
the
series
of
orders
carried
out
for
the
campaign
of
the
year
twelve
composed
itself
not
because
those
orders
were
in
any
way
different
from
the
others
that
were
not
carried
out
but
because
the
series
of
those
orders
corresponded
to
the
series
of
events
that
brought
french
troops
to
russia
just
as
in
stenciling
some
figure
or
other
gets
painted
not
depending
on
the
direction
or
manner
in
which
the
paint
is
applied
but
because
the
figure
cut
out
of
the
stencil
is
smeared
in
all
directions
with
paint
so
that
considering
the
relation
of
orders
to
events
in
time
we
will
find
that
orders
can
in
no
way
be
the
cause
of
events
but
that
there
exists
a
certain
dependence
between
the
one
and
the
other
to
understand
what
this
dependence
is
it
is
necessary
to
restore
another
omitted
condition
of
any
order
proceeding
not
from
a
divinity
but
from
a
man
which
consists
in
the
fact
that
the
man
who
orders
participates
in
the
event
himself
this
relation
of
the
one
who
orders
to
those
whom
he
orders
is
precisely
what
is
called
power
this
relation
consists
in
the
following
for
common
activity
people
always
form
themselves
into
certain
units
within
which
despite
the
variety
of
purposes
set
for
the
joint
action
the
relation
among
the
people
participating
in
the
activity
is
always
the
same
in
forming
these
units
people
always
arrive
at
such
relations
among
themselves
that
the
largest
number
of
people
take
the
largest
direct
the
smallest
number
of
people
the
smallest
direct
the
joint
action
for
which
they
have
come
together
of
all
the
units
that
people
form
for
carrying
out
joint
actions
one
of
the
most
distinct
and
definite
is
an
army
every
army
is
made
up
of
members
of
the
lowest
military
rankprivatesof
whom
there
is
always
the
largest
number
of
members
of
the
next
higher
military
rankcorporals
sergeantswho
are
fewer
in
number
than
the
first
of
still
higher
rank
who
are
still
fewer
in
number
and
so
on
to
the
highest
military
power
which
is
concentrated
in
one
person
military
organization
can
be
expressed
with
perfect
precision
in
the
figure
of
the
cone
in
which
the
base
with
the
largest
diameter
would
be
made
up
of
the
privates
the
higher
smaller
sections
of
the
higher
ranks
of
the
army
and
so
on
to
the
apex
of
the
cone
the
point
of
which
would
be
the
commander
in
chief
the
soldiers
of
whom
there
is
the
largest
number
constitute
the
lowest
points
of
the
cone
and
its
base
the
soldier
himself
directly
stabs
cuts
burns
loots
and
always
receives
orders
for
these
actions
from
higherplaced
persons
he
himself
never
gives
orders
a
sergeant
the
number
of
sergeants
is
already
smaller
performs
the
action
itself
more
rarely
than
the
soldier
but
he
does
give
orders
an
officer
still
more
rarely
performs
the
action
itself
and
still
more
often
gives
orders
a
general
only
orders
the
troops
to
move
pointing
to
the
goal
and
almost
never
uses
weapons
the
commander
can
never
take
a
direct
the
action
itself
and
only
gives
general
instructions
about
the
movement
of
the
masses
the
same
relations
of
persons
among
themselves
is
manifested
in
any
group
of
people
united
for
common
activityin
farming
trade
and
any
management
and
so
without
artificially
separating
all
the
converging
points
of
the
cone
and
ranks
of
the
army
or
the
titles
and
positions
of
any
management
or
common
business
from
lowest
to
highest
a
law
is
manifested
according
to
which
for
the
carrying
out
of
a
joint
action
people
always
form
themselves
into
such
relations
that
the
more
immediately
people
participate
in
carrying
out
the
action
the
less
they
can
give
orders
and
the
greater
their
number
and
the
smaller
the
direct
people
take
in
the
action
itself
the
more
they
give
orders
and
the
smaller
their
number
rising
in
this
way
from
the
lowest
layers
to
the
one
last
man
who
takes
the
least
direct
the
event
and
more
than
all
aims
his
activity
at
giving
orders
this
relation
of
the
persons
who
give
orders
to
those
whom
they
order
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
concept
known
as
power
having
restored
the
conditions
of
time
under
which
all
events
occur
we
found
that
an
order
is
executed
only
when
it
refers
to
a
corresponding
series
of
events
restoring
the
necessary
condition
of
the
connection
between
the
one
who
orders
and
the
one
who
carries
out
we
have
found
that
it
is
an
inherent
property
of
those
who
order
to
take
the
least
the
event
itself
and
that
their
activity
is
aimed
exclusively
at
giving
orders
vii
when
some
event
takes
place
people
express
their
opinions
and
wishes
about
the
event
and
since
the
event
results
from
the
joint
action
of
many
people
one
of
the
opinions
or
wishes
expressed
is
bound
to
be
fulfilled
if
only
approximately
when
one
of
the
opinions
expressed
is
fulfilled
that
opinion
is
connected
with
the
event
as
the
order
preceding
it
men
are
dragging
a
log
each
of
them
expresses
his
opinion
about
how
and
where
to
drag
it
the
men
drag
the
log
out
and
it
is
discovered
that
it
was
done
the
way
one
of
them
had
said
he
gave
the
order
here
are
order
and
power
in
their
primitive
form
the
one
who
mainly
worked
with
his
hands
was
less
able
to
think
over
what
he
was
doing
to
consider
what
might
come
of
the
common
activity
and
to
give
orders
the
one
who
mainly
gave
orders
as
a
consequence
of
his
verbal
activity
was
obviously
less
able
to
act
with
his
hands
the
greater
the
assembly
of
people
aiming
their
activity
at
a
single
goal
the
more
sharply
set
off
is
the
category
of
people
who
take
a
less
direct
the
common
activity
the
more
their
activity
is
aimed
at
giving
orders
a
man
when
he
acts
alone
always
bears
within
himself
a
certain
series
of
considerations
which
guided
as
it
seems
to
him
his
past
activity
serve
him
as
a
justification
for
his
present
activity
and
guide
him
in
his
suppositions
about
his
future
acts
assemblies
of
people
do
exactly
the
same
thing
leaving
it
to
those
who
do
not
participate
in
the
action
to
think
up
considerations
justifications
and
suppositions
about
their
joint
activity
for
reasons
known
or
unknown
to
us
the
french
begin
to
drown
and
slaughter
each
other
and
the
event
is
correspondingly
accompanied
by
its
justification
in
the
expressed
wills
of
the
people
about
the
necessity
of
it
for
the
welfare
of
france
for
liberty
for
equality
people
stop
slaughtering
each
other
and
this
event
is
accompanied
by
its
justification
in
the
necessity
to
unify
power
to
repulse
europe
and
so
on
people
go
from
west
to
east
killing
their
own
kind
and
this
event
is
accompanied
by
words
about
the
glory
of
france
the
baseness
of
england
and
so
on
history
shows
us
that
these
justifications
of
the
event
have
no
general
sense
and
contradict
themselves
like
killing
a
man
in
recognition
of
his
rights
and
killing
millions
in
russia
to
humiliate
england
but
in
a
contemporary
sense
these
justifications
have
a
necessary
significance
these
justifications
take
away
the
moral
responsibility
of
the
people
who
produce
events
these
temporary
goals
are
similar
to
the
brushes
that
go
in
front
of
a
train
to
clear
the
way
on
the
rails
they
clear
the
way
of
peoples
moral
responsibility
without
these
justifications
there
could
be
no
explaining
the
simplest
question
which
presents
itself
with
the
examination
of
every
event
how
is
it
that
millions
of
people
commit
joint
crimes
wars
killings
and
so
on
given
the
complex
presentday
forms
of
state
and
social
life
in
europe
is
it
possible
to
think
up
any
sort
of
event
that
would
not
have
been
prescribed
indicated
ordered
by
sovereigns
ministers
parliaments
the
newspapers
is
there
any
joint
action
that
would
not
find
its
justification
in
state
unity
in
nationality
in
the
balance
of
europe
in
civilization
thus
every
event
that
takes
place
inevitably
coincides
with
some
expressed
desire
and
receiving
its
justification
is
seen
as
a
product
of
the
will
of
one
or
more
persons
wherever
a
moving
ship
may
be
heading
at
its
bow
will
always
be
seen
the
swirl
of
the
wave
it
cuts
through
for
people
on
the
ship
the
movement
of
that
swirl
will
be
the
only
noticeable
movement
only
by
following
closely
moment
by
moment
the
movement
of
that
swirl
and
comparing
that
movement
with
the
movement
of
the
ship
will
we
realize
that
at
every
moment
the
movement
of
the
swirl
is
determined
by
the
movement
of
the
ship
and
that
we
were
misled
by
the
fact
that
we
ourselves
were
imperceptibly
moving
we
will
see
the
same
thing
if
we
follow
moment
by
moment
the
movement
of
historical
figures
that
is
having
restored
the
necessary
condition
of
all
that
happensthe
condition
of
the
continuity
of
movement
in
time
and
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
necessary
connection
of
historical
figures
with
the
masses
when
a
ship
goes
in
one
direction
there
is
one
and
the
same
swirl
at
its
bow
when
it
frequently
changes
direction
the
swirl
running
ahead
of
it
also
shifts
frequently
but
wherever
it
turns
there
will
always
be
a
swirl
preceding
its
movement
whatever
happens
it
will
always
turn
out
that
that
very
thing
had
been
foreseen
and
ordered
wherever
a
ship
heads
the
swirl
without
guiding
it
without
reinforcing
its
movement
foams
at
its
bow
and
from
afar
will
appear
to
us
not
only
to
be
moving
by
its
own
will
but
to
be
guiding
the
movement
of
the
ship
considering
only
those
expressions
of
the
will
of
historical
figures
which
relate
to
events
as
orders
historians
have
supposed
that
events
depend
on
orders
considering
the
events
by
themselves
and
that
connection
with
the
masses
in
which
historical
figures
find
themselves
we
have
discovered
that
historical
figures
and
their
orders
depend
on
the
event
the
unquestionable
proof
of
this
conclusion
is
the
fact
that
however
great
the
number
of
orders
the
event
will
not
take
place
unless
there
are
other
reasons
for
it
but
once
the
eventwhatever
it
may
betakes
place
there
will
be
found
among
the
ceaselessly
expressed
wills
of
various
persons
those
which
by
their
sense
and
timing
will
relate
to
the
event
as
orders
having
come
to
this
conclusion
we
can
answer
directly
and
positively
those
two
essential
questions
of
history
1
what
is
power
2
what
force
produces
the
movement
of
peoples
1
power
is
that
relation
of
a
certain
person
to
other
persons
in
which
the
person
takes
the
less
the
action
the
more
he
expresses
opinions
suppositions
and
justifications
for
the
jointly
accomplished
action
2
the
movement
of
peoples
is
produced
not
by
power
not
by
intellectual
activity
not
even
by
a
combination
of
the
two
as
historians
used
to
think
but
by
the
activity
of
all
the
people
taking
the
event
and
always
joining
together
in
such
a
way
that
those
who
take
the
greatest
direct
the
event
take
the
least
responsibility
upon
themselves
and
vice
versa
in
the
moral
respect
the
cause
of
the
event
appears
to
be
power
in
the
physical
respect
those
who
submit
to
power
but
since
moral
activity
is
unthinkable
without
physical
activity
the
cause
of
the
event
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
a
combination
of
the
two
or
in
other
words
the
concept
of
a
cause
is
inapplicable
to
the
phenomenon
we
are
considering
in
the
last
analysis
we
arrive
at
an
eternal
circle
at
that
utmost
brink
at
which
in
every
domain
of
thought
the
human
mind
always
arrives
if
it
is
not
toying
with
its
subject
electricity
produces
heat
heat
produces
electricity
atoms
attract
each
other
atoms
repel
each
other
in
speaking
of
the
interaction
of
heat
and
electricity
or
of
atoms
we
cannot
tell
why
it
happens
that
way
and
we
say
that
it
is
that
way
because
it
is
unthinkable
otherwise
because
it
has
to
be
that
way
because
it
is
a
law
it
is
the
same
with
respect
to
historical
phenomena
why
does
a
war
or
a
revolution
take
place
we
do
not
know
we
know
only
that
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
one
action
or
the
other
people
form
themselves
into
certain
units
and
all
participate
and
we
say
that
this
is
so
because
it
is
unthinkable
otherwise
because
it
is
a
law
viii
if
history
had
to
do
with
no
more
than
external
phenomena
the
positing
of
this
simple
and
obvious
law
would
be
enough
and
we
would
be
done
with
our
argument
but
the
law
of
history
relates
to
man
a
particle
of
matter
cannot
tell
us
that
it
feels
no
need
at
all
to
attract
or
repel
and
that
it
is
not
true
but
man
who
is
the
subject
of
history
says
outright
i
am
free
and
therefore
not
subject
to
the
law
the
presence
of
the
question
of
mans
free
will
though
unspoken
is
felt
at
every
step
of
history
all
seriousminded
historians
have
involuntarily
arrived
at
this
question
all
the
contradictions
and
obscurities
of
history
the
wrong
path
that
this
science
has
taken
are
based
only
on
the
nonsolution
of
this
question
if
the
will
of
each
man
were
free
that
is
if
each
could
act
as
he
pleased
the
whole
of
history
would
be
a
series
of
incoherent
accidents
if
even
one
man
out
of
millions
in
a
thousandyear
period
of
time
has
had
the
possibility
of
acting
freely
that
is
as
he
pleased
then
it
is
obvious
that
one
free
act
of
this
man
contrary
to
the
laws
destroys
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
any
laws
whatever
for
the
whole
of
mankind
if
there
is
just
one
law
that
governs
the
actions
of
men
then
there
can
be
no
free
will
for
the
will
of
men
would
have
to
submit
to
that
law
in
this
contradiction
lies
the
question
of
freedom
of
the
will
which
from
ancient
times
has
occupied
the
best
minds
of
mankind
and
since
ancient
times
has
been
posed
in
all
its
enormous
significance
the
question
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
looking
at
man
as
an
object
of
observation
from
any
point
of
viewtheological
historical
ethical
philosophicalwe
find
a
general
law
of
necessity
to
which
he
is
subject
like
all
that
exists
while
looking
at
him
from
within
ourselves
as
that
which
we
are
conscious
of
we
feel
ourselves
free
this
consciousness
is
a
totally
separate
source
of
selfknowledge
independent
of
reason
through
reason
man
observes
himself
but
he
knows
himself
only
through
consciousness
without
consciousness
of
oneself
no
observation
and
no
application
of
reason
are
thinkable
in
order
to
understand
observe
deduce
man
must
first
be
conscious
of
himself
as
alive
a
living
man
knows
himself
not
otherwise
than
as
wanting
that
is
he
is
conscious
of
his
will
and
his
will
which
constitutes
the
essence
of
his
life
man
is
conscious
of
and
cannot
be
conscious
of
otherwise
than
as
free
if
subjecting
himself
to
observation
man
sees
that
his
will
is
always
directed
according
to
one
and
the
same
law
whether
he
observes
the
necessity
of
taking
food
or
the
activity
of
the
brain
or
whatever
he
cannot
understand
this
always
identical
direction
of
his
will
otherwise
than
as
a
limitation
of
it
that
which
is
not
free
cannot
be
limited
mans
will
appears
limited
to
him
precisely
because
he
is
conscious
of
it
not
otherwise
than
as
free
you
say
i
am
not
free
but
i
have
raised
and
lowered
my
arm
everyone
understands
that
this
illogical
answer
is
an
irrefutable
proof
of
freedom
this
answer
is
the
expression
of
a
consciousness
not
subject
to
reason
if
the
consciousness
of
freedom
were
not
a
separate
source
of
selfknowledge
independent
of
reason
it
would
be
subject
to
reasoning
and
experience
but
in
reality
such
subjection
never
occurs
and
is
unthinkable
a
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
shows
each
man
that
as
an
object
of
observation
he
is
subject
to
certain
laws
and
man
submits
to
them
and
never
fights
against
the
law
of
gravity
or
of
impermeability
once
he
knows
them
but
that
same
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
shows
him
that
full
freedom
which
he
is
conscious
of
in
himself
is
impossible
that
his
every
action
depends
on
his
constitution
his
character
and
the
motives
that
influence
him
yet
man
never
submits
to
the
conclusions
of
these
experiments
and
arguments
having
learned
from
experience
and
argument
that
a
stone
falls
downwards
man
believes
it
unquestioningly
and
in
all
cases
expects
the
law
he
has
learned
to
be
fulfilled
but
having
learned
as
unquestionably
that
his
will
is
subject
to
laws
he
does
not
and
cannot
believe
it
however
many
times
experience
and
argument
have
shown
a
man
that
in
the
same
conditions
with
the
same
character
he
would
do
the
same
thing
he
did
before
he
when
he
sets
out
for
the
thousandth
time
in
the
same
conditions
with
the
same
character
on
an
action
that
has
always
ended
the
same
way
undoubtedly
feels
no
less
certain
that
he
can
act
as
he
pleases
than
he
did
before
the
experience
every
man
savage
or
sage
however
irrefutably
argument
and
experience
prove
to
him
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
two
acts
in
the
same
conditions
feels
that
without
this
senseless
notion
which
constitutes
the
essence
of
freedom
he
cannot
imagine
life
he
feels
that
impossible
as
it
may
be
it
is
so
for
without
this
notion
of
freedom
he
not
only
would
not
understand
life
but
could
not
live
for
a
single
moment
he
could
not
live
because
all
mans
strivings
all
his
impulses
to
life
are
but
strivings
towards
greater
freedom
wealth
and
poverty
fame
and
obscurity
power
and
submission
strength
and
weakness
health
and
sickness
education
and
ignorance
work
and
idleness
satiety
and
hunger
virtue
and
vice
are
nothing
but
greater
or
lesser
degrees
of
freedom
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
to
oneself
a
man
who
has
no
freedom
otherwise
than
as
deprived
of
life
if
for
reason
the
concept
of
freedom
presents
itself
as
senselessly
contradictory
like
the
possibility
of
performing
two
acts
in
the
same
moment
of
time
or
an
action
without
a
cause
that
only
proves
that
consciousness
is
not
subject
to
reason
this
consciousness
of
freedom
unshakable
irrefutable
not
subject
to
experience
or
argument
recognized
by
all
thinkers
and
sensed
by
all
human
beings
without
exception
a
consciousness
without
which
any
notion
of
man
is
unthinkable
constitutes
the
other
side
of
the
question
man
is
the
creation
of
an
almighty
allgood
and
allknowing
god
what
then
is
sin
the
concept
of
which
follows
from
the
consciousness
of
mans
freedom
that
is
a
question
for
theology
mens
actions
are
subject
to
general
immutable
laws
expressed
by
statistics
in
what
then
consists
mans
responsibility
before
society
the
concept
of
which
follows
from
the
consciousness
of
mans
freedom
that
is
a
question
for
jurisprudence
mans
acts
follow
from
his
innate
character
and
the
motives
acting
upon
him
what
is
conscience
and
the
consciousness
of
the
good
and
evil
of
acts
following
from
the
consciousness
of
freedom
that
is
a
question
for
ethics
a
man
in
connection
with
the
common
life
of
mankind
appears
subject
to
the
laws
defining
that
life
but
the
same
man
independent
of
that
connection
appears
free
how
should
the
past
life
of
peoples
and
of
mankind
be
regardedas
a
product
of
the
free
or
unfree
activity
of
men
that
is
a
question
for
history
only
in
our
selfconfident
time
of
the
popularization
of
knowledge
thanks
to
that
most
powerful
tool
of
ignorancethe
spread
of
printinghas
the
question
of
freedom
of
will
been
reduced
to
grounds
on
which
the
question
itself
cannot
exist
in
our
time
the
majority
of
socalled
advanced
people
that
is
a
crowd
of
ignoramuses
have
taken
the
works
of
the
naturalists
who
study
one
side
of
the
question
for
the
solution
of
the
whole
question
the
soul
and
freedom
do
not
exist
because
the
life
of
man
is
expressed
in
muscular
movements
and
muscular
movements
are
conditioned
by
nervous
activity
the
soul
and
freedom
do
not
exist
because
at
some
unknown
period
of
time
we
descended
from
the
apesthey
say
write
and
print
not
even
suspecting
that
thousands
of
years
ago
all
religions
and
all
thinkers
not
only
recognized
but
never
tried
to
deny
that
very
law
of
necessity
which
they
now
try
so
zealously
to
prove
by
means
of
physiology
and
comparative
zoology
they
do
not
see
that
the
role
of
natural
science
in
this
question
consists
only
in
serving
as
an
instrument
to
throw
light
on
one
side
of
it
for
the
fact
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
observation
reason
and
will
are
only
secretions
of
the
brain
and
man
following
a
general
law
could
develop
from
lower
animals
at
an
unknown
period
of
time
only
clarifies
from
a
new
side
a
truth
recognized
thousands
of
years
ago
by
all
religious
and
philosophical
theories
that
from
the
viewpoint
of
reason
man
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
necessity
but
does
not
advance
by
a
hair
the
solution
of
the
question
which
has
another
opposite
side
based
on
the
consciousness
of
freedom
if
men
descended
from
the
apes
at
an
unknown
period
of
time
that
is
as
comprehensible
as
that
men
descended
from
a
handful
of
earth
at
a
known
period
of
time
in
the
first
case
the
x
is
time
in
the
second
the
descent
and
the
question
of
how
the
consciousness
of
mans
freedom
can
be
combined
with
the
law
of
necessity
to
which
man
is
subject
cannot
be
resolved
by
comparative
physiology
and
zoology
for
in
the
frog
the
rabbit
and
the
ape
we
can
observe
only
muscular
and
nervous
activity
while
in
man
both
muscular
and
nervous
activity
and
consciousness
the
naturalists
and
their
admirers
who
think
to
solve
this
question
are
like
plasterers
assigned
to
plaster
one
side
of
a
church
wall
who
taking
advantage
of
the
foremans
absence
in
a
fit
of
zeal
smear
their
plaster
all
over
the
windows
the
icons
the
scaffolding
and
the
as
yet
unreinforced
walls
and
rejoice
at
how
from
their
plastering
point
of
view
everything
comes
out
flat
and
smooth
ix
for
the
solution
of
the
question
of
freedom
and
necessity
history
has
the
advantage
over
other
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
the
same
question
is
raised
that
for
history
this
question
refers
not
to
the
essence
of
mans
will
but
to
the
notion
of
the
manifestation
of
that
will
in
the
past
and
under
certain
conditions
for
the
solution
of
this
question
history
stands
to
other
sciences
in
the
position
of
an
experimental
science
to
speculative
sciences
history
has
as
its
subject
not
the
will
of
man
itself
but
our
notion
of
it
and
therefore
the
insoluble
mystery
of
the
combining
of
the
two
opposites
freedom
and
necessity
does
not
exist
for
history
as
it
does
for
theology
ethics
and
philosophy
history
examines
the
notion
of
mans
life
in
which
the
combining
of
these
two
opposites
has
already
taken
place
in
actual
life
every
historical
event
every
human
action
is
understood
quite
clearly
and
definitely
without
the
least
sense
of
contradiction
even
though
each
event
appears
partly
free
and
partly
necessary
to
solve
the
question
of
how
freedom
and
necessity
are
combined
and
what
constitutes
the
essence
of
these
two
concepts
the
philosophy
of
history
can
and
must
follow
a
path
opposite
to
the
one
other
sciences
have
taken
instead
of
defining
the
concepts
of
freedom
and
necessity
in
themselves
and
then
fitting
the
phenomena
of
life
to
the
workedout
definitions
history
must
take
the
immense
number
of
phenomena
lying
before
it
which
always
appear
dependent
on
freedom
and
necessity
and
from
them
derive
a
definition
of
the
concepts
of
freedom
and
necessity
themselves
whatever
notion
of
the
activity
of
many
people
or
one
man
we
examine
we
understand
it
not
otherwise
than
as
a
product
partly
of
freedom
and
partly
of
the
law
of
necessity
whether
we
are
speaking
of
the
migration
of
peoples
and
the
raids
of
barbarians
or
of
the
decrees
of
napoleon
iii
or
of
the
act
of
a
man
performed
an
hour
ago
which
consisted
in
choosing
one
direction
out
of
many
for
a
strollwe
see
not
the
slightest
contradiction
the
measure
of
freedom
and
necessity
that
guided
the
acts
of
these
men
is
clearly
defined
for
us
quite
often
the
notion
of
greater
or
lesser
freedom
varies
according
to
the
different
points
of
view
from
which
we
examine
a
phenomenon
butalways
in
the
same
wayevery
human
action
appears
to
us
not
otherwise
than
as
a
certain
conjunction
of
freedom
and
necessity
in
every
action
examined
we
see
a
certain
portion
of
freedom
and
a
certain
portion
of
necessity
and
always
the
more
freedom
we
see
in
whatever
action
the
less
necessity
and
the
more
necessity
the
less
freedom
the
ratio
of
freedom
to
necessity
decreases
or
increases
depending
on
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
action
is
examined
but
this
ratio
always
remains
inversely
proportional
a
drowning
man
who
clutches
another
and
drowns
him
or
a
hungry
mother
exhausted
from
nursing
her
baby
who
steals
food
or
a
man
accustomed
to
discipline
who
stands
in
a
firing
squad
and
kills
a
defenseless
man
on
command
appears
less
guilty
that
is
less
free
and
more
subject
to
the
law
of
necessity
to
someone
who
knows
the
conditions
these
people
were
in
and
more
free
to
someone
who
does
not
know
that
the
man
was
himself
drowning
that
the
mother
was
hungry
that
the
soldier
was
in
a
firing
squad
and
so
on
in
the
same
way
a
man
who
twenty
years
ago
committed
a
murder
and
after
that
lived
peacefully
and
harmlessly
in
society
appears
less
guiltyhis
act
more
subject
to
the
law
of
necessityfor
someone
who
examines
it
after
a
lapse
of
twenty
years
and
more
free
to
someone
who
examined
it
the
day
after
it
was
committed
and
in
the
same
way
every
act
of
a
crazy
drunk
or
greatly
agitated
man
appears
less
free
and
more
necessary
to
someone
who
knows
the
inner
state
of
the
one
who
commits
the
act
and
more
free
and
less
necessary
to
someone
who
does
not
know
it
in
all
these
cases
the
concept
of
freedom
increases
or
decreases
and
correspondingly
the
concept
of
necessity
decreases
or
increases
depending
on
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
act
is
examined
so
that
the
greater
the
necessity
appears
the
lesser
the
freedom
appears
and
vice
versa
religion
mankinds
common
sense
jurisprudence
and
history
itself
understand
this
ratio
between
necessity
and
freedom
in
the
same
way
all
occasions
without
exception
in
which
our
notion
of
freedom
and
necessity
increases
and
decreases
have
only
three
bases
1
the
relation
of
the
man
committing
the
act
to
the
external
world
2
to
time
and
3
to
the
causes
producing
the
act
1
the
first
basis
is
the
relation
more
or
less
visible
to
us
of
the
man
to
the
external
world
the
more
or
less
clear
notion
of
that
definite
place
which
every
man
occupies
in
relation
to
everything
that
exists
simultaneously
with
him
this
is
that
basis
owing
to
which
it
is
obvious
that
the
drowning
man
is
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
a
man
standing
on
dry
land
that
basis
owing
to
which
the
actions
of
a
man
living
in
close
connection
with
other
people
in
a
densely
populated
area
the
actions
of
a
man
who
is
connected
with
family
work
enterprises
appear
unquestionably
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
the
actions
of
man
who
is
single
and
solitary
if
we
examine
a
man
alone
without
his
relation
to
everything
around
him
his
every
action
appears
free
to
us
but
if
we
see
at
least
some
relation
to
what
is
around
him
if
we
see
his
connection
with
anything
whateverwith
the
man
who
is
talking
to
him
with
the
book
he
is
reading
with
the
work
he
is
doing
even
with
the
air
that
surrounds
him
even
with
the
light
that
falls
on
things
around
himwe
see
that
each
of
these
conditions
has
an
influence
on
him
and
guides
at
least
one
side
of
his
activity
and
insofar
as
we
see
these
influences
so
far
our
notion
of
his
freedom
decreases
and
our
notion
of
the
necessity
he
is
subject
to
increases
2
the
second
basis
is
the
more
or
less
visible
temporal
relation
of
man
to
the
world
the
more
or
less
clear
notion
of
the
place
that
the
action
of
a
man
occupies
in
time
this
is
that
basis
owing
to
which
the
fall
of
the
first
man
which
had
as
its
consequence
the
origin
of
mankind
appears
obviously
less
free
than
a
modern
mans
marriage
this
is
that
basis
owing
to
which
the
life
and
activity
of
people
who
lived
centuries
ago
and
are
connected
with
me
in
time
cannot
appear
as
free
to
me
as
modern
life
the
consequences
of
which
are
still
unknown
to
me
the
degree
of
our
notion
of
greater
or
lesser
freedom
and
necessity
in
this
relation
depends
on
the
greater
or
lesser
span
of
time
between
the
committing
of
the
act
and
our
judgment
of
it
if
i
examine
an
act
i
committed
a
moment
ago
under
approximately
the
same
conditions
as
i
am
in
now
my
action
seems
unquestionably
free
to
me
but
if
i
review
an
act
i
committed
a
month
ago
i
involuntarily
recognize
being
in
different
conditions
that
if
that
act
had
not
been
committed
many
useful
agreeable
and
even
necessary
things
which
resulted
from
that
act
would
not
have
taken
place
if
i
transport
myself
in
memory
to
an
act
still
more
remote
ten
years
back
or
more
the
consequences
of
my
act
will
appear
still
more
obvious
to
me
and
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
imagine
what
would
have
happened
if
the
act
had
not
been
done
the
further
back
i
transport
myself
in
memory
or
what
is
the
same
ahead
in
my
judgment
the
more
questionable
my
argument
about
the
freedom
of
the
act
will
become
in
history
we
find
exactly
the
same
progression
of
convincingness
about
the
portion
of
free
will
in
the
general
affairs
of
mankind
a
justaccomplished
contemporary
event
appears
to
us
as
unquestionably
proceeding
from
all
known
people
but
in
a
more
remote
event
we
see
its
inevitable
consequences
aside
from
which
we
cannot
imagine
anything
else
and
the
further
back
we
transport
ourselves
in
examining
events
the
less
arbitrary
they
appear
to
us
the
austroprussian
war
appears
to
us
as
the
unquestionable
consequence
of
the
actions
of
cunning
bismarck
and
so
on
the
napoleonic
wars
though
questionably
now
still
appear
to
us
as
proceeding
from
the
wills
of
heroes
in
the
crusades
we
already
see
an
event
which
occupies
a
definite
place
and
without
which
the
modern
history
of
europe
is
unthinkable
though
in
the
same
way
for
the
chroniclers
of
the
crusades
this
event
appeared
only
as
proceeding
from
the
wills
of
several
persons
as
for
the
migrations
of
peoples
it
never
occurs
to
anyone
in
our
time
that
the
renewal
of
the
european
world
depended
on
the
good
pleasure
of
attila
the
further
back
in
history
we
transport
the
object
of
our
observation
the
more
questionable
becomes
the
freedom
of
the
men
producing
events
and
the
more
obvious
the
law
of
necessity
3
the
third
basis
is
the
greater
or
lesser
accessibility
for
us
of
that
endless
linking
of
causes
that
constitutes
the
inevitable
demand
of
reason
and
in
which
every
phenomenon
comprehended
and
therefore
every
human
action
should
have
its
definite
place
as
a
consequence
of
what
precedes
and
a
cause
of
what
follows
this
is
that
basis
owing
to
which
our
own
and
other
peoples
actions
appear
to
us
on
the
one
hand
as
more
free
and
less
subject
to
necessity
the
more
we
know
of
those
physiological
psychological
and
historical
laws
man
is
subject
to
deduced
from
observation
and
the
more
correctly
we
perceive
the
physiological
psychological
or
historical
cause
of
the
action
and
on
the
other
hand
the
simpler
the
observed
action
itself
and
the
less
complex
the
character
and
mind
of
the
man
whose
action
we
are
examining
when
we
totally
fail
to
understand
the
cause
of
an
actwhether
an
evil
deed
a
good
deed
or
even
an
act
indifferent
to
good
and
evilwe
recognize
in
such
an
act
a
greater
share
of
freedom
if
it
is
an
evil
deed
we
most
of
all
demand
punishment
for
such
an
act
if
it
is
a
good
deed
we
most
of
all
appreciate
such
an
act
if
it
is
indifferent
we
recognize
its
greater
individuality
originality
freedom
but
if
just
one
of
the
countless
reasons
is
known
to
us
we
already
recognize
a
certain
share
of
necessity
and
demand
a
lesser
requital
for
the
crime
recognize
a
lesser
merit
in
the
good
deed
a
lesser
freedom
in
the
seemingly
original
act
the
fact
that
a
criminal
was
brought
up
among
evildoers
already
extenuates
his
guilt
the
selflessness
of
a
father
of
a
mother
selflessness
with
a
possibility
of
reward
is
more
comprehensible
than
causeless
selflessness
and
therefore
appears
less
deserving
of
sympathy
less
free
the
founder
of
a
sect
or
party
the
inventor
surprise
us
less
when
we
know
how
and
by
what
his
activity
was
prepared
for
if
we
have
a
large
series
of
experiences
if
our
observation
is
constantly
directed
at
finding
the
correlation
of
causes
and
effects
in
peoples
actions
their
actions
appear
the
more
necessary
and
the
less
free
to
us
the
more
correctly
we
connect
effects
with
causes
if
the
examined
actions
are
simple
and
we
have
for
observation
an
enormous
number
of
such
actions
our
notion
of
their
necessity
will
be
more
complete
the
dishonest
act
of
the
son
of
a
dishonest
father
the
bad
behavior
of
a
woman
who
ended
up
in
a
certain
milieu
a
drunkards
return
to
drinking
and
so
on
are
actions
which
appear
the
less
free
to
us
the
more
comprehensible
we
find
their
cause
and
if
the
person
himself
whose
actions
we
are
examining
stands
on
the
lowest
level
of
mental
development
like
a
child
a
madman
a
simpleton
then
knowing
the
causes
of
the
action
and
the
incomplexity
of
his
character
and
mind
we
already
see
so
large
a
share
of
necessity
and
so
small
of
freedom
that
once
the
cause
that
is
to
produce
the
action
is
known
to
us
we
can
predict
the
act
only
on
these
three
bases
have
irresponsibility
for
crimes
and
extenuating
circumstances
which
exist
in
all
legal
codes
been
constructed
responsibility
appears
greater
or
lesser
depending
on
a
greater
or
lesser
knowledge
of
the
conditions
in
which
the
man
whose
action
is
being
reviewed
found
himself
and
on
the
greater
or
lesser
span
of
time
from
the
committing
of
the
act
to
the
judging
of
it
and
on
the
greater
or
lesser
understanding
of
the
causes
of
the
act
x
thus
our
notion
of
freedom
and
necessity
gradually
decreases
or
increases
depending
on
the
greater
or
lesser
connection
with
the
external
world
the
greater
or
lesser
distance
in
time
and
the
greater
or
lesser
dependence
on
causes
in
which
we
examine
the
phenomenon
of
human
life
so
that
if
we
examine
a
man
in
such
a
situation
that
his
connection
with
the
external
world
is
most
fully
known
the
period
between
the
time
of
judgment
and
the
time
of
committing
the
act
is
longest
and
the
causes
of
the
act
are
most
accessible
then
we
get
the
notion
of
the
greatest
necessity
and
the
least
freedom
but
if
we
examine
a
man
in
least
dependence
on
external
conditions
if
his
action
is
committed
in
the
moment
closest
to
the
present
and
the
causes
of
his
action
are
inaccessible
to
us
then
we
will
get
the
notion
of
the
least
necessity
and
the
greatest
freedom
but
neither
in
the
one
case
nor
in
the
other
however
we
may
change
our
point
of
view
however
we
may
try
to
grasp
what
connection
the
man
finds
himself
in
with
the
external
world
or
however
inaccessible
it
seems
to
us
however
much
we
lengthen
or
shorten
the
period
of
time
however
intelligible
or
unfathomable
the
causes
are
for
uswe
can
never
imagine
either
total
freedom
or
total
necessity
1
however
we
may
try
to
imagine
a
man
excluded
from
the
influences
of
the
external
world
we
will
never
arrive
at
a
concept
of
freedom
in
space
a
mans
every
action
is
inevitably
conditioned
by
what
surrounds
him
and
by
his
own
body
i
raise
my
arm
and
lower
it
my
action
seems
free
to
me
but
asking
myself
if
i
could
raise
my
arm
in
any
direction
i
see
that
i
raised
my
arm
in
the
direction
in
which
there
were
fewest
obstacles
to
that
action
either
from
bodies
around
me
or
from
the
structure
of
my
own
body
if
out
of
all
possible
directions
i
chose
one
i
did
so
because
there
were
fewer
obstacles
in
that
direction
for
my
action
to
be
free
it
is
necessary
that
it
not
meet
with
any
obstacles
to
imagine
man
as
free
we
must
imagine
him
outside
space
which
is
obviously
impossible
2
however
close
together
we
bring
the
time
of
judgment
to
the
time
of
the
act
we
will
never
get
a
concept
of
freedom
in
time
for
if
i
examine
an
act
committed
a
second
ago
i
must
still
recognize
the
unfreedom
of
the
act
since
the
act
is
bound
to
the
moment
of
time
in
which
it
was
committed
can
i
raise
my
arm
i
raise
it
but
i
ask
myself
could
i
have
not
raised
my
arm
in
that
already
past
moment
of
time
to
convince
myself
of
it
i
do
not
raise
my
arm
in
the
next
moment
but
it
is
not
in
that
first
moment
when
i
asked
myself
about
freedom
that
i
did
not
raise
my
arm
time
went
by
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
stop
it
and
the
arm
which
i
then
raised
and
the
air
in
which
i
then
made
that
movement
are
no
longer
the
air
which
now
surrounds
me
and
the
arm
with
which
i
now
do
not
make
that
movement
the
moment
in
which
the
first
movement
was
performed
is
irretrievable
and
at
that
moment
i
could
make
only
one
movement
and
whatever
movement
i
made
that
movement
could
be
the
only
one
the
fact
that
i
did
not
raise
my
arm
the
next
moment
does
not
prove
that
i
could
have
not
raised
it
and
since
my
movement
could
be
the
only
one
in
one
moment
of
time
it
could
not
be
any
other
to
imagine
it
as
free
one
must
imagine
it
in
the
present
at
the
border
of
past
and
future
that
is
outside
time
which
is
impossible
3
however
much
the
difficulty
of
comprehending
causes
may
increase
we
will
never
arrive
at
the
notion
of
total
freedom
that
is
the
absence
of
cause
however
unfathomable
for
us
is
the
cause
of
the
expression
of
will
in
any
act
of
mine
or
others
the
first
demand
of
intelligence
is
the
assumption
of
and
search
for
a
cause
without
which
no
phenomenon
is
conceivable
i
raise
my
arm
in
order
to
perform
an
act
independent
of
any
cause
but
the
fact
that
i
want
to
perform
an
act
that
has
no
cause
is
the
cause
of
my
act
but
even
if
imagining
a
man
completely
excluded
from
all
influences
examining
only
his
instantaneous
act
in
the
present
not
provoked
by
any
cause
we
should
allow
the
infinitesimally
small
remainder
of
necessity
to
equal
zero
we
would
still
not
arrive
at
a
notion
of
mans
total
freedom
for
a
being
who
is
not
affected
by
the
influences
of
the
external
world
who
is
outside
time
and
does
not
depend
on
causes
is
no
longer
a
man
in
the
same
way
we
can
never
imagine
the
actions
of
a
man
without
any
participation
of
freedom
and
subject
only
to
the
law
of
necessity
1
however
much
our
knowledge
of
the
spatial
conditions
in
which
man
finds
himself
may
increase
that
knowledge
can
never
be
complete
since
the
number
of
those
conditions
is
as
infinitely
great
as
space
is
infinite
and
therefore
so
long
as
not
all
the
conditions
influencing
man
are
defined
there
is
no
complete
necessity
and
there
is
a
certain
share
of
freedom
2
however
much
we
may
lengthen
the
period
of
time
between
the
phenomenon
we
are
examining
and
the
time
of
judgment
that
period
will
be
finite
while
time
is
infinite
and
therefore
in
this
respect
there
can
never
be
complete
necessity
3
however
accessible
the
chain
of
causes
of
any
event
we
will
never
know
the
entire
chain
because
it
is
endless
and
again
we
will
never
get
complete
necessity
but
besides
that
even
if
having
allowed
the
smallest
remainder
of
freedom
to
equal
zero
we
were
to
recognize
in
some
casefor
instance
a
dying
man
a
fetus
an
idiota
total
absence
of
freedom
we
would
thereby
destroy
the
very
concept
of
the
man
we
are
examining
because
once
there
is
no
freedom
there
is
no
man
and
therefore
to
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
that
is
subject
only
to
the
law
of
necessity
without
the
slightest
remainder
of
freedom
is
as
impossible
as
to
imagine
a
totally
free
action
thus
to
imagine
the
act
of
a
man
that
is
subject
to
the
law
of
necessity
alone
without
freedom
we
must
allow
for
knowledge
of
an
infinite
number
of
spatial
conditions
an
infinitely
great
period
of
time
and
an
infinite
series
of
causes
to
imagine
a
man
who
is
completely
free
not
subject
to
the
law
of
necessity
we
must
imagine
him
alone
outside
space
outside
time
and
outside
any
dependence
on
causes
in
the
first
case
if
necessity
without
freedom
were
possible
we
would
arrive
at
the
definition
of
the
law
of
necessity
by
that
same
necessity
that
is
at
form
alone
without
content
in
the
second
case
if
freedom
without
necessity
were
possible
we
would
arrive
at
unconditional
freedom
outside
space
time
and
causes
which
by
the
very
fact
of
being
unconditional
and
unlimited
by
anything
would
be
nothing
or
content
alone
without
form
we
would
arrive
generally
at
those
two
bases
from
which
mans
whole
worldview
is
formedat
the
unfathomable
essence
of
life
and
at
the
laws
which
define
that
essence
reason
says
1
space
with
all
the
forms
which
its
visibilitymattergives
it
is
infinite
and
cannot
be
conceived
otherwise
2
time
is
infinite
movement
without
a
moments
rest
and
cannot
be
conceived
otherwise
3
the
linking
of
causes
and
effects
has
no
beginning
and
can
have
no
end
consciousness
says
1
i
am
alone
and
all
that
exists
is
only
i
consequently
i
include
space
2
i
measure
fleeting
time
by
the
unmoving
moment
of
the
present
in
which
alone
i
am
conscious
of
myself
as
living
consequently
i
am
outside
time
and
3
i
am
outside
cause
for
i
feel
myself
to
be
the
cause
of
every
manifestation
of
my
life
reason
expresses
the
laws
of
necessity
consciousness
expresses
the
essence
of
freedom
freedom
not
limited
by
anything
is
the
essence
of
life
in
the
consciousness
of
man
necessity
without
content
is
mans
reason
with
its
three
forms
freedom
is
that
which
is
examined
necessity
is
that
which
examines
freedom
is
content
necessity
is
form
only
by
the
separation
of
the
two
sources
of
cognition
which
are
related
to
each
other
as
form
to
content
do
we
get
the
distinct
mutually
exclusive
and
unfathomable
concepts
of
freedom
and
necessity
only
by
their
union
do
we
get
a
clear
picture
of
the
life
of
man
outside
these
two
concepts
mutually
defining
in
their
union
as
form
and
content
no
picture
of
life
is
possible
all
that
we
know
about
the
life
of
men
is
only
a
certain
relation
of
freedom
to
necessity
that
is
of
consciousness
to
the
laws
of
reason
all
that
we
know
about
the
external
world
of
nature
is
only
a
certain
relation
of
the
forces
of
nature
to
necessity
or
of
the
essence
of
life
to
the
laws
of
reason
the
forces
of
the
life
of
nature
lie
outside
us
and
we
are
not
conscious
of
them
and
we
call
these
forces
gravity
inertia
electricity
animal
force
and
so
on
but
we
are
conscious
of
the
force
of
mans
life
and
we
call
it
freedom
but
just
as
the
force
of
gravity
unfathomable
in
itself
but
sensed
by
every
man
is
only
comprehensible
to
us
insofar
as
we
know
the
law
of
necessity
it
is
subject
to
from
the
primitive
knowledge
that
all
bodies
are
heavy
to
newtons
law
so
too
the
force
of
freedom
unfathomable
in
itself
but
of
which
each
of
us
is
conscious
is
only
comprehensible
to
us
insofar
as
we
know
the
laws
of
necessity
which
it
is
subject
to
starting
from
the
fact
that
every
man
dies
and
going
as
far
as
the
knowledge
of
the
most
complex
economic
or
historical
laws
any
knowledge
is
only
the
placing
of
the
essence
of
life
under
the
laws
of
reason
mans
freedom
differs
from
any
other
force
in
that
man
is
conscious
of
this
force
but
for
reason
it
is
no
different
from
any
other
force
the
forces
of
gravity
electricity
or
chemical
agents
differ
from
each
other
only
in
that
they
are
differently
defined
by
reason
in
the
same
way
for
reason
the
force
of
mans
freedom
differs
from
all
other
forces
of

it

as
the

the

and
so
on
so
the
essence
of
the
force
of
freedom
makes
up
the
content
of
history
but
just
as
the
subject
of
any
science
is
the
manifestation
of
this
unknown
essence
of
life
while
the
essence
itself
can
only
be
the
subject
of
metaphysics
so
the
manifestation
of
the
force
of
mens
freedom
in
space
time
and
dependence
on

is
the
subject
of

freedom

is
the

we

what

the

we

freedom
is
only
the

the

remainder

we

xi
history
examines
the
manifestations
of
mans
freedom
in
connection
with
the
external
world
in
time
and
in
dependence
on
causes
that
is
it
defines
that
freedom
by
the
laws
of
reason
and
therefore
history
is
only
a
science
insofar
as
that
freedom
is
defined
by
those
laws
for
history
to
recognize
mens
freedom
as
a
force
capable
of
influencing
historical
events
that
is
as
not
subject
to
laws
is
the
same
as
for
astronomy
to
recognize
a
free
force
moving
the
heavenly
bodies
that
recognition
destroys
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
laws
that
is
of
any
knowledge
whatever
if
at
least
one
freely
moving
body
exists
then
the
laws
of
kepler
and
newton
no
longer
exist
nor
does
any
notion
of
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
if
there
exists
one
free
act
of
man
then
not
a
single
historical
law
exists
or
any
notion
of
historical
events
for
history
there
exist
the
lines
of
movement
of
human
wills
one
end
of
which
vanishes
into
the
unknown
but
at
the
other
end
of
which
the
consciousness
of
mens
freedom
in
the
present
moves
in
space
in
time
and
in
dependence
on
causes
the
more
this
field
of
movement
expands
before
our
eyes
the
more
obvious
are
the
laws
of
this
movement
to
grasp
and
determine
those
laws
constitutes
the
task
of
history
from
the
point
of
view
from
which
historical
science
now
looks
at
its
subject
on
the
path
it
follows
seeking
the
causes
of
phenomena
in
the
free
will
of
men
it
is
impossible
for
it
to
express
laws
for
however
much
we
limit
mens
freedom
as
soon
as
we
recognize
it
as
a
force
not
subject
to
laws
the
existence
of
law
is
impossible
only
by
limiting
this
freedom
infinitely
that
is
by
looking
upon
it
as
an
infinitely
small
quantity
will
we
be
convinced
of
the
total
inaccessibility
of
causes
and
then
instead
of
searching
for
causes
history
will
set
itself
the
task
of
searching
for
laws
the
search
for
these
laws
has
long
since
begun
and
the
new
methods
of
thinking
which
history
should
adopt
for
itself
are
being
worked
out
simultaneously
with
the
selfdestruction
towards
which
ever
subdividing
and
subdividing
the
causes
of
phenomena
the
old
history
is
moving
all
of
mankinds
sciences
have
followed
this
path
having
arrived
at
the
infinitely
small
mathematics
the
most
exact
of
sciences
abandons
the
process
of
subdividing
and
starts
on
a
new
process
of
summing
up
the
unknown
infinitesimals
renouncing
the
concept
of
cause
mathematics
seeks
laws
that
is
properties
common
to
all
unknown
infinitely
small
elements
other
sciences
though
in
a
different
form
have
followed
this
same
path
of
thinking
when
newton
formulated
the
law
of
gravity
he
did
not
say
that
the
sun
or
the
earth
has
the
property
of
attraction
he
said
that
all
bodies
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
have
this
property
of
attracting
each
other
as
it
were
that
is
leaving
aside
the
question
of
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
bodies
he
formulated
the
property
common
to
all
bodies
from
the
infinitely
large
to
the
infinitely
small
the
natural
sciences
do
the
same
leaving
aside
the
question
of
cause
they
seek
for
laws
history
stands
on
the
same
path
and
if
history
has
for
its
subject
of
study
the
movements
of
peoples
and
of
mankind
and
not
the
description
of
episodes
from
peoples
lives
it
should
set
aside
the
notion
of
causes
and
seek
for
the
laws
common
to
all
the
equal
and
inseparably
bound
together
infinitely
small
elements
of
freedom
xii
ever
since
copernicuss
law
was
found
and
proved
the
mere
recognition
of
the
fact
that
what
moves
is
not
the
sun
but
the
earth
has
destroyed
the
whole
cosmology
of
the
ancients
it
might
have
been
possible
by
refuting
the
law
to
retain
the
old
view
of
the
movement
of
bodies
but
without
refuting
it
it
would
have
been
impossible
it
seems
to
go
on
studying
the
ptolemaic
worlds
yet
even
after
the
discovery
of
copernicuss
law
the
ptolemaic
worlds
long
went
on
being
studied
ever
since
the
first
man
said
and
proved
that
the
number
of
births
or
crimes
obeys
mathematical
laws
that
certain
geographic
and
politicoeconomic
conditions
determine
one
or
another
form
of
government
and
that
certain
relations
of
the
inhabitants
to
the
land
produce
movements
of
peoplesever
since
then
the
foundations
on
which
history
had
been
built
were
essentially
destroyed
it
might
have
been
possible
by
refuting
the
new
laws
to
retain
the
former
view
of
history
but
without
refuting
them
it
would
have
been
impossible
it
seems
to
go
on
studying
historical
events
as
if
they
proceeded
from
mens
free
will
for
if
a
certain
form
of
government
has
been
established
or
a
certain
movement
of
peoples
has
taken
place
owing
to
suchandsuch
geographic
ethnographic
or
economic
conditions
then
the
will
of
those
men
who
appear
to
us
as
establishing
a
form
of
government
or
provoking
a
movement
of
peoples
can
no
longer
be
considered
the
cause
and
yet
the
former
history
goes
on
being
studied
on
a
par
with
the
laws
of
statistics
geography
political
economy
comparative
philology
and
geology
which
directly
contradict
its
postulates
a
long
and
stubborn
struggle
went
on
in
physical
philosophy
between
the
old
and
new
views
theology
stood
guard
over
the
old
view
and
accused
the
new
of
destroying
revelation
but
when
the
truth
triumphed
theology
established
itself
as
firmly
on
the
new
soil
just
as
long
and
stubborn
a
struggle
has
gone
on
in
our
time
between
the
old
and
new
views
of
history
and
in
the
same
way
theology
stands
guard
over
the
old
view
and
accuses
the
new
of
destroying
revelation
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
struggle
on
both
sides
arouses
passions
and
stifles
the
truth
on
one
side
of
the
struggle
there
is
fear
and
pity
for
the
whole
edifice
erected
over
the
centuries
on
the
other
the
passion
for
destruction
to
the
people
who
fought
against
the
emerging
truth
of
physical
philosophy
it
seemed
that
if
they
were
to
recognize
that
truth
faith
in
god
in
the
creation
of
the
firmament
in
the
miracle
of
joshua
son
of
nun
would
be
destroyed
to
the
defenders
of
the
laws
of
copernicus
and
newtonvoltaire
for
instanceit
seemed
that
the
laws
of
astronomy
destroyed
religion
and
he
used
the
law
of
gravity
as
a
weapon
against
religion
in
the
same
way
now
it
seems
that
we
need
only
recognize
the
law
of
necessity
and
the
notions
of
the
soul
of
good
and
evil
and
all
state
and
church
institutions
based
on
those
notions
will
be
destroyed
in
the
same
way
now
as
with
voltaire
in
his
time
the
uninvited
defenders
of
the
law
of
necessity
use
that
law
as
a
weapon
against
religion
whereasexactly
like
copernicuss
law
in
astronomythe
law
of
necessity
in
history
not
only
does
not
destroy
but
even
consolidates
the
ground
on
which
state
and
church
institutions
are
built
as
in
the
question
of
astronomy
then
so
now
in
the
question
of
history
all
the
difference
in
views
is
based
on
the
recognition
or
nonrecognition
of
an
absolute
unit
serving
as
a
measure
of
visible
phenomena
in
astronomy
this
was
the
immobility
of
the
earth
in
history
it
is
the
independence
of
the
personfreedom
as
for
astronomy
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
the
movement
of
the
earth
consisted
in
renouncing
the
immediate
feeling
of
the
immobility
of
the
earth
and
the
similar
feeling
of
the
movement
of
the
planets
so
for
history
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
the
subjection
of
the
person
to
the
laws
of
space
time
and
causes
consists
in
renouncing
the
immediate
feeling
of
the
independence
of
ones
person
but
as
in
astronomy
the
new
view
said
true
we
do
not
feel
the
movement
of
the
earth
but
by
assuming
its
immobility
we
arrive
at
an
absurdity
whereas
by
assuming
the
movement
which
we
do
not
feel
we
arrive
at
laws
so
too
in
history
the
new
view
says
true
we
do
not
feel
our
dependence
but
by
assuming
we
are
free
we
arrive
at
an
absurdity
whereas
by
assuming
our
dependence
on
the
external
world
time
and
causes
we
arrive
at
laws
in
the
first
case
the
need
was
to
renounce
the
consciousness
of
a
nonexistent
immobility
in
space
and
recognize
a
movement
we
do
not
feel
in
the
present
case
it
is
just
as
necessary
to
renounce
a
nonexistent
freedom
and
recognize
a
dependence
we
do
not
feel
the
end
appendix
a
few
words
apropos
of
the
bookwar
and
peace
publishing
a
work
on
which
i
have
spent
five
years
of
ceaseless
and
exclusive
labor
under
the
best
conditions
of
life
i
would
like
in
a
preface
to
that
work
to
state
my
view
of
it
and
thereby
forestall
those
perplexities
which
may
arise
in
readers
i
would
like
readers
not
to
see
or
seek
in
my
book
what
i
did
not
want
or
was
not
able
to
express
and
to
pay
attention
to
precisely
what
i
wanted
to
express
but
on
which
given
the
conditions
of
its
production
i
did
not
consider
it
appropriate
to
dwell
neither
time
nor
my
skill
allowed
me
to
fully
carry
out
my
intention
and
i
avail
myself
of
the
hospitality
of
a
specialized
journal
to
state
however
briefly
and
incompletely
for
those
readers
whom
it
might
interest
the
authors
view
of
his
work
1
what
is
war
and
peace
it
is
not
a
novel
still
less
an
epic
poem
still
less
a
historical
chronicle
war
and
peace
is
what
the
author
wanted
and
was
able
to
express
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
expressed
such
a
declaration
of
the
authors
disregard
of
the
conventional
forms
of
artistic
prose
works
might
seem
presumptuous
if
it
were
premeditated
and
if
it
had
no
previous
examples
the
history
of
russian
literature
since
pushkins
time
not
only
provides
many
examples
of
such
departure
from
european
forms
but
does
not
offer
even
one
example
to
the
contrary
from
gogols
dead
souls
to
dostoevskys
dead
house
there
is
not
a
single
work
of
artistic
prose
in
the
modern
period
of
russian
literature
rising
slightly
above
mediocrity
that
would
fit
perfectly
into
the
form
of
the
novel
the
epic
or
the
story
2
the
character
of
the
time
as
some
readers
expressed
to
me
when
the
first
in
print
is
insufficiently
defined
in
my
work
to
this
reproach
i
have
the
following
rejoinder
i
know
what
this
character
of
the
time
is
that
people
do
not
find
in
my
novelthe
horrors
of
serfdom
the
immuring
of
wives
the
whipping
of
adult
sons
saltychikha
and
so
on
and
this
character
of
that
time
which
lives
in
our
imagination
i
do
not
consider
correct
and
did
not
wish
to
express
studying
letters
diaries
legends
i
did
not
find
all
the
horrors
of
that
brutality
in
a
greater
degree
than
i
find
them
now
or
at
any
other
time
in
those
times
too
people
loved
envied
sought
truth
virtue
were
carried
away
by
passions
there
was
the
same
complex
mental
and
moral
life
sometimes
even
more
refined
than
now
among
the
upper
classes
if
in
our
minds
we
have
formed
an
opinion
of
the
arbitrariness
and
crude
force
characteristic
of
that
time
it
is
only
because
the
legends
memoirs
stories
and
novels
that
have
come
down
to
us
record
only
the
most
outstanding
cases
of
violence
and
brutality
to
conclude
that
the
prevailing
character
of
that
time
was
brutality
is
as
incorrect
as
it
would
be
for
a
man
who
sees
only
treetops
beyond
a
hill
to
conclude
that
there
is
nothing
but
trees
in
that
region
there
is
a
character
of
that
time
as
there
is
of
every
epoch
which
comes
from
the
greater
alienation
of
the
upper
circles
from
the
other
estates
from
the
reigning
philosophy
from
peculiarities
of
upbringing
from
the
habit
of
using
the
french
language
and
so
on
and
this
character
i
have
tried
as
far
as
i
could
to
express
3
the
use
of
french
in
a
russian
work
why
is
it
that
in
my
work
not
only
the
russians
but
also
the
french
speak
partly
in
russian
partly
in
french
the
reproach
that
people
speak
and
write
in
french
in
a
russian
book
is
similar
to
the
reproach
made
by
a
man
who
looking
at
a
painting
notices
black
spots
in
it
shadows
that
are
not
found
in
reality
the
painter
is
not
to
blame
if
the
shadow
he
has
made
on
the
face
in
the
painting
looks
to
some
like
a
black
spot
that
does
not
exist
in
reality
but
is
to
blame
only
if
those
shadows
are
laid
on
incorrectly
and
crudely
studying
the
period
of
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
portraying
russian
figures
of
a
certain
society
and
napoleon
and
the
french
who
took
such
a
direct
the
life
of
that
time
i
was
involuntarily
carried
away
more
than
necessary
by
the
form
of
expression
of
that
french
way
of
thinking
and
therefore
without
denying
that
the
shadows
i
laid
on
are
probably
incorrect
and
crude
i
wish
only
that
those
to
whom
it
seems
very
funny
that
napoleon
speaks
now
in
russian
now
in
french
should
know
that
it
seems
so
to
them
because
like
the
man
looking
at
the
portrait
they
see
not
a
face
with
light
and
shadow
but
only
a
black
spot
under
its
nose

the
names
of
charactersbolkonsky
drubetskoy
bilibin
kuragin
and
othersresemble
wellknown
russian
names
in
juxtaposing
nonhistorical
characters
with
other
characters
who
are
historical
it
felt
awkward
to
my
ear
to
make
count
rastopchin
talk
with
prince
pronsky
strelsky
or
some
other
princes
or
counts
with
invented
double
or
single
last
names
bolkonsky
and
drubetskoy
though
they
are
neither
volkonsky
nor
trubetskoy
have
the
ring
of
something
familiar
and
natural
in
a
russian
aristocratic
circle
i
was
unable
to
invent
names
for
all
my
characters
such
as
bezukhov
and
rostov
that
did
not
seem
false
to
my
ear
and
could
not
get
around
this
difficulty
otherwise
than
by
taking
the
last
names
most
familiar
to
a
russian
ear
and
changing
some
letters
in
them
i
would
be
very
sorry
if
the
similarity
of
the
invented
names
to
real
ones
should
give
anyone
the
idea
that
i
meant
to
describe
this
or
that
real
person
especially
because
the
literary
activity
that
consists
in
describing
persons
who
really
exist
or
existed
has
nothing
in
common
with
that
which
i
was
engaged
in
m
d
akhrosimov
and
denisov
are
exceptional
characters
to
whom
i
involuntarily
and
thoughtlessly
gave
names
that
closely
resemble
those
of
two
particularly
distinctive
and
dear
real
persons
of
the
society
of
that
time
that
was
my
mistake
which
came
from
the
particular
distinctiveness
of
these
two
persons
but
my
mistake
in
this
regard
was
limited
to
the
introducing
of
these
two
characters
alone
and
readers
will
probably
agree
that
nothing
resembling
reality
happens
to
these
characters
all
the
rest
of
the
characters
are
completely
invented
and
for
me
do
not
even
have
any
specific
prototypes
in
tradition
or
reality
5
the
divergence
between
my
descriptions
of
historical
events
and
the
accounts
of
historians
it
is
not
accidental
but
inevitable
a
historian
and
an
artist
describing
a
historical
epoch
have
two
completely
different
objects
as
a
historian
would
be
wrong
if
he
should
try
to
present
a
historical
figure
in
all
his
entirety
in
all
the
complexity
of
his
relations
to
all
sides
of
life
so
an
artist
would
not
fulfill
his
task
by
always
presenting
a
figure
in
his
historical
significance
kutuzov
did
not
always
ride
a
white
horse
holding
a
field
glass
and
pointing
at
enemies
rastopchin
did
not
always
take
torch
in
hand
and
set
fire
to
his
voronovo
house
in
fact
he
never
did
it
at
all
and
the
empress
maria
feodorovna
did
not
always
stand
in
an
ermine
mantle
her
hand
resting
on
the
code
of
law
but
that
is
how
they
are
pictured
in
the
popular
imagination
for
a
historian
considering
the
contribution
rendered
by
some
person
towards
a
certain
goal
there
are
heroes
for
the
artist
considering
the
correspondence
of
this
person
to
all
sides
of
life
there
cannot
and
should
not
be
any
heroes
but
there
should
be
people
the
historian
is
sometimes
obliged
by
bending
the
truth
to
bring
all
the
actions
of
a
historical
figure
under
the
one
idea
he
has
put
into
that
figure
the
artist
on
the
contrary
sees
the
very
singularity
of
that
idea
as
incompatible
with
his
task
and
only
tries
to
understand
and
show
not
the
famous
figure
but
the
human
being
the
distinction
is
still
sharper
and
more
substantial
in
the
description
of
events
themselves
a
historian
has
to
do
with
the
results
of
an
event
the
artist
with
the
fact
of
the
event
a
historian
describing
a
battle
says
the
left
flank
of
suchandsuch
army
was
moved
against
suchandsuch
village
cut
down
the
enemy
but
was
forced
to
retreat
then
the
cavalry
going
into
the
attack
overthrewand
so
on
the
historian
cannot
speak
otherwise
and
yet
these
words
have
no
meaning
for
an
artist
and
do
not
even
touch
upon
the
event
itself
the
artist
using
his
own
experience
or
letters
memoirs
and
accounts
derives
for
himself
an
image
of
the
event
that
took
place
and
quite
often
in
a
battle
for
example
the
conclusion
which
the
historian
allows
himself
to
draw
about
the
activity
of
suchandsuch
army
turns
out
to
be
the
opposite
of
the
artists
conclusion
the
difference
between
the
results
obtained
is
explained
by
the
sources
from
which
the
two
draw
their
information
for
the
historian
we
continue
the
example
of
a
battle
the
main
source
is
the
reports
of
individual
commanders
and
the
commander
in
chief
the
artist
can
draw
nothing
from
such
sources
they
tell
him
nothing
explain
nothing
moreover
the
artist
turns
away
from
them
finding
in
them
a
necessary
falsehood
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
with
every
battle
the
two
enemies
almost
always
describe
it
in
a
totally
opposite
way
from
each
other
in
every
description
of
a
battle
there
is
a
necessity
for
falsehood
which
comes
from
the
need
to
describe
in
a
few
words
the
actions
of
thousands
of
men
scattered
over
several
miles
who
are
in
the
most
intense
moral
agitation
under
the
influence
of
fear
shame
and
death
in
descriptions
of
battles
it
is
usually
written
that
suchandsuch
army
was
sent
to
attack
suchandsuch
point
and
was
then
ordered
to
retreat
and
so
on
as
if
supposing
that
the
discipline
that
makes
tens
of
thousands
of
men
obey
the
will
of
one
man
on
the
drill
ground
will
have
the
same
effect
where
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
anyone
who
has
been
to
war
knows
how
incorrect
that
is
and
yet
official
reports
are
based
on
this
supposition
and
military
descriptions
on
them
make
the
rounds
of
a
whole
army
right
after
a
battle
even
on
the
second
or
third
day
before
the
reports
have
been
written
and
ask
all
the
soldiers
the
senior
and
junior
officers
how
it
went
they
will
tell
you
what
all
these
men
experienced
and
saw
and
you
will
form
a
majestic
complex
infinitely
diverse
oppressive
and
vague
impression
and
from
no
one
least
of
all
the
commander
in
chief
will
you
learn
how
it
all
went
but
after
two
or
three
days
the
reports
begin
to
be
submitted
talkers
begin
telling
how
what
they
did
not
see
happened
finally
a
general
account
is
put
together
and
the
general
opinion
of
the
army
is
put
together
from
this
account
it
is
a
relief
to
everyone
to
exchange
his
doubts
and
questions
for
this
false
but
clear
and
always
flattering
picture
after
a
month
or
two
question
a
man
who
took
the
battleyou
no
longer
feel
in
his
story
that
raw
material
of
life
which
had
been
there
before
his
account
follows
the
report
so
i
was
told
about
the
battle
of
borodino
by
many
living
intelligent
participants
in
that
affair
they
all
told
me
the
same
thing
and
all
following
the
incorrect
descriptions
of
mikhailovskydanilevsky
glinka
and
others
even
the
details
they
recounted
were
the
same
though
the
narrators
had
been
several
miles
from
each
other
after
the
loss
of
sevastopol
the
artillery
commander
kryzhanovsky
sent
me
the
reports
of
the
artillery
officers
from
all
the
bastions
and
asked
me
to
put
those
more
than
twenty
accounts
together
into
one
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
make
copies
of
those
reports
it
was
the
best
example
of
that
na239ve
and
necessary
military
falsehood
from
which
descriptions
are
put
together
i
suppose
that
many
of
my
comrades
who
put
together
those
accounts
then
will
laugh
having
read
these
lines
at
the
recollection
of
how
on
orders
from
their
superiors
they
wrote
something
they
could
not
have
known
everyone
who
has
had
the
experience
of
war
knows
how
capable
russians
are
of
doing
their
duty
in
war
and
how
little
capable
they
are
of
describing
it
with
the
boastful
falsity
necessary
to
the
task
everyone
knows
that
in
our
armies
this
duty
of
writing
reports
and
accounts
is
for
the
most
out
by
our
nonrussians
i
say
all
this
in
order
to
show
the
inevitability
of
falsehood
in
the
military
descriptions
which
serve
as
material
for
military
historians
and
therefore
to
show
the
inevitability
of
frequent
disagreements
between
artists
and
historians
in
understanding
historical
events
but
besides
the
inevitability
of
untruths
in
their
setting
forth
of
historical
events
i
encountered
in
the
historians
of
the
epoch
that
interested
me
probably
as
a
result
of
the
habit
of
grouping
events
expressing
them
briefly
and
conforming
to
the
tragic
tone
of
the
events
a
particular
inclination
to
highflown
speech
in
which
falsehood
and
distortion
often
touch
not
only
the
events
but
also
the
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
an
event
often
in
studying
the
two
main
historical
productions
of
that
epoch
thiers
and
mikhailovskydanilevsky
i
would
become
perplexed
at
how
these
books
could
be
printed
and
read
not
to
speak
of
the
setting
forth
of
the
same
events
in
the
most
serious
significant
tone
with
references
to
the
materials
and
yet
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
i
encountered
in
these
historians
such
descriptions
that
i
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
weep
when
i
remembered
that
these
two
books
are
the
sole
memorials
of
that
epoch
and
have
millions
of
readers
i
will
give
only
one
example
from
the
book
of
the
famous
historian
thiers
having
told
how
napoleon
brought
counterfeit
money
with
him
he
says
relevant
lemploi

this
passage
taken
separately
strikes
one
by
its
deafening
one
cannot
say
immorality
but
sheer
meaninglessness
but
within
the
book
as
a
whole
it
does
not
strike
one
because
it
corresponds
perfectly
to
the
highflown
solemn
tone
lacking
in
any
direct
meaning
of
its
overall
style
and
so
the
tasks
of
the
artist
and
the
historian
are
completely
different
and
the
disagreements
with
historians
in
the
description
of
events
and
figures
in
my
book
should
not
strike
the
reader
but
the
artist
should
not
forget
that
the
notion
of
historical
figures
and
events
formed
among
people
is
based
not
on
fantasy
but
on
historical
documents
insofar
as
historians
have
been
able
to
amass
them
and
therefore
while
understanding
and
presenting
these
figures
and
events
differently
the
artist
ought
to
be
guided
like
the
historian
by
historical
materials
wherever
in
my
novel
historical
figures
speak
and
act
i
have
not
invented
but
have
made
use
of
the
materials
of
which
during
my
work
i
have
formed
a
whole
library
the
titles
of
which
i
find
it
unnecessary
to
set
down
here
but
for
which
i
can
always
give
the
reference
6
finally
the
sixth
and
for
me
the
most
important
consideration
concerns
the
small
significance
which
to
my
mind
socalled
great
men
have
in
historical
events
in
studying
an
epoch
so
tragic
so
rich
in
the
enormity
of
its
events
and
so
near
to
us
of
which
such
a
variety
of
traditions
still
live
i
arrived
at
the
obviousness
of
the
fact
that
the
causes
of
the
historical
events
that
take
place
are
inaccessible
to
our
intelligence
to
say
which
seems
quite
simple
to
everyone
that
the
causes
of
the
events
of
the
year
twelve
are
the
conquering
spirit
of
napoleon
and
the
patriotic
firmness
of
the
emperor
alexander
pavlovich
is
as
meaningless
as
to
say
that
the
causes
of
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
are
that
suchandsuch
barbarian
led
his
people
to
the
west
and
suchandsuch
roman
emperor
ruled
his
people
badly
or
that
an
immense
mountain
that
was
being
leveled
came
down
because
the
last
workman
drove
his
spade
into
it
such
an
event
in
which
millions
of
men
set
about
killing
each
other
and
killed
half
a
million
cannot
have
the
will
of
one
man
as
its
cause
just
as
one
man
alone
could
not
undermine
a
mountain
so
one
man
cannot
make
five
hundred
thousand
die
but
what
then
were
the
causes
some
historians
say
that
the
cause
was
the
conquering
spirit
of
the
french
the
patriotism
of
russia
others
speak
of
the
democratic
element
that
napoleons
host
spread
about
and
of
the
necessity
for
russia
to
enter
into
relations
with
europe
and
so
on
but
how
is
it
that
millions
of
men
set
about
killing
each
other
who
ordered
them
to
do
it
it
seems
clear
to
everyone
that
no
one
would
be
the
better
for
it
but
all
would
be
the
worse
why
then
did
they
do
it
a
countless
number
of
retrospective
conjectures
can
be
made
and
are
being
made
about
the
causes
of
this
senseless
event
but
the
enormous
number
of
these
explanations
and
their
convergence
on
one
goal
only
proves
that
there
is
a
countless
multitude
of
these
causes
and
that
none
of
them
can
be
called
the
cause
why
did
millions
of
men
set
about
killing
each
other
if
it
has
been
known
ever
since
the
world
began
that
it
is
both
physically
and
morally
bad
because
it
was
so
inevitably
necessary
that
in
fulfilling
it
men
were
fulfilling
that
elementary
zoological
law
which
the
bees
fulfill
by
exterminating
each
other
in
the
fall
and
according
to
which
male
animals
exterminate
each
other
no
other
answer
can
be
given
to
this
terrible
question
this
truth
is
not
only
obvious
but
is
so
innate
in
every
man
that
it
would
not
be
worth
proving
if
there
were
not
another
feeling
and
consciousness
in
man
which
convinces
him
that
he
is
free
at
every
moment
as
he
performs
some
action
examining
history
from
a
general
point
of
view
we
are
unquestionably
convinced
of
the
preeternal
law
according
to
which
events
take
place
looking
from
a
personal
point
of
view
we
are
convinced
of
the
opposite
a
man
killing
another
napoleon
giving
the
order
to
cross
the
niemen
you
and
i
applying
for
a
job
raising
and
lowering
our
arm
are
all
unquestionably
convinced
that
each
of
our
acts
is
based
on
reasonable
causes
and
our
own
will
and
that
it
depended
on
us
to
act
that
way
and
not
otherwise
and
that
conviction
is
so
inherent
and
dear
to
each
of
us
that
despite
the
arguments
of
history
and
the
statistics
of
crime
which
convince
us
of
the
involuntariness
of
other
peoples
actions
we
extend
the
consciousness
of
our
freedom
to
all
our
acts
the
contradiction
seems
insoluble
in
committing
an
act
i
am
convinced
that
i
am
committing
it
according
to
my
own
good
pleasure
examining
this
act
in
terms
of
its
being
the
common
life
of
mankind
in
its
historical
significance
i
am
convinced
that
this
act
was
predetermined
and
inevitable
where
does
the
mistake
lie
psychological
observations
of
mans
ability
to
make
an
instantaneous
retrospective
adjustment
of
a
whole
series
of
allegedly
free
conjectures
to
an
accomplished
fact
i
intend
to
set
this
forth
in
more
detail
elsewhere
confirm
the
assumption
that
mans
consciousness
of
freedom
in
the
committing
of
acts
of
a
certain
sort
is
mistaken
but
those
same
psychological
observations
prove
that
there
are
acts
of
another
sort
in
which
the
consciousness
of
freedom
is
not
retrospective
but
instantaneous
and
unquestionable
whatever
the
materialists
may
say
i
can
unquestionably
commit
an
action
or
refrain
from
it
insofar
as
that
action
conerns
me
alone
by
my
will
alone
i
have
unquestionably
just
raised
and
lowered
my
arm
i
can
presently
stop
writing
you
can
presently
stop
reading
unquestionably
by
my
will
alone
and
outside
any
obstacles
i
can
mentally
transport
myself
right
now
to
america
or
to
any
mathematical
problem
testing
my
freedom
i
can
raise
and
forcefully
lower
my
arm
in
the
air
i
have
just
done
so
but
there
is
a
child
standing
beside
me
i
raise
my
arm
over
him
and
want
to
lower
it
with
the
same
force
upon
the
child
i
cannot
do
that
a
dog
attacks
the
child
i
cannot
help
raising
my
arm
against
the
dog
i
stand
in
the
ranks
and
cannot
help
following
the
movements
of
the
regiment
in
battle
i
cannot
help
attacking
with
my
regiment
and
fleeing
when
everyone
around
me
flees
when
i
am
standing
in
court
as
defender
of
an
accused
man
i
cannot
help
speaking
or
knowing
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
cannot
help
blinking
when
a
blow
is
aimed
at
my
eye
and
so
there
are
two
sorts
of
acts
one
depends
the
other
does
not
depend
on
my
will
and
the
mistake
that
produces
a
contradiction
comes
only
from
the
fact
that
i
wrongly
transfer
the
consciousness
of
freedom
which
legitimately
accompanies
any
act
connected
with
my
i
with
the
highest
abstraction
of
my
existence
to
my
acts
committed
jointly
with
other
people
and
depending
on
the
coinciding
of
other
wills
with
my
own
to
determine
the
boundaries
of
the
domains
of
freedom
and
dependence
is
very
difficult
and
the
determining
of
those
boundaries
is
the
essential
and
sole
task
of
psychology
but
observing
the
conditions
of
the
manifestation
of
our
greatest
freedom
and
greatest
dependence
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
that
the
more
abstract
our
activity
is
and
therefore
the
less
connected
with
the
activity
of
others
the
more
free
it
is
and
on
the
contrary
the
more
our
activity
is
connected
with
other
people
the
more
unfree
it
is
the
most
strong
indissoluble
burdensome
and
constant
connection
with

people
is
the
socalled
power
over

in
its

meaning
is
only
the
greatest
dependence
on
them
mistakenly

not

become
fully
convinced

in

it

natural
that
in

the

1807

of
1812
in

this

stands
out
most
prominently

could
not
ascribe
importance
to
the
activity
of
those
people
who
fancied
they
were

who
introduced
less

human
activity
into
them
than
all
the
other
participants
in
the

the
activity
of
those
people
was
interesting
to
me
only
as
an
illustration
of
that
law
of
predetermination
which
in
my
conviction
governs
history
and
of
that
psychological
law
which
makes
a
person
who
commits
the
most
unfree
act
adjust
in

absence
though

tell
myself

half
of

i
am
unable

a
certain
hidden
sadness

feel

our
separation
why

we
not
reunited

all
moscow
talks
only
of
war
one
of
my
two
brothers
is
already
abroad
the
other
is
with
the
guards
who
are
starting
on
the
march
to
the
frontier
our
dear
emperor
has
left
petersburg
and
they
claim
is
intending
to
expose
his
own
precious
existence
to
the
hazards
of
war
god
grant
that
the
corsican
monster
who
is
destroying
the
peace
of
europe
be
overthrown
by
the
angel
whom
the
almighty
in
his
mercy
has
given
us
for
a
sovereign
not
to
mention
my
brothers
this
war
has
deprived
me
of
a
relation
that
is
one
of
the
dearest
to
my
heart
i
am
speaking
of
young
nikolai
rostov
who
with
his
enthusiasm
could
not
bear
inaction
and
has
left
the
university
to
go
and
enlist
in
the
army
well
dear
marie
ill
admit
to
you
that
despite
his
extreme
youth
his
leaving
for
the
army
has
been
a
great
sadness
for
me
the
young
man
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
this
summer
has
so
much
nobility
so
much
true
youthfulness
which
one
encounters
so
rarely
in
the
age
we
live
in
among
our
old
men
of
twenty
above
all
he
has
so
much
candor
and
heart
he
is
so
pure
and
poetical
that
my
relations
with
him
ephemeral
as
they
were
have
been
one
of
the
sweetest
joys
of
my
poor
heart
which
has
already
suffered
so
much
one
day
ill
tell
you
about
our
farewells
and
all
that
got
said
in
parting
its
all
still
too
fresh
ah
dear
friend
you
are
fortunate
not
to
know
these
so
poignant
joys
and
sorrows
you
are
fortunate
because
the
latterare
usually
the
stronger
i
know
very
well
that
count
nikolai
is
too
young
ever
to
be
able
to
be
anything
more
than
a
friend
to
me
but
this
sweet
friendship
these
relations
so
poetical
and
so
pure
have
been
a
need
of
my
heart
but
let
us
speak
no
more
of
that
the
big
news
of
the
day
with
which
all
moscow
is
taken
up
is
the
death
of
old
count
bezukhov
and
his
inheritance
imagine
the
three
princesses
got
very
little
prince
vassily
nothing
and
it
is
m
pierre
who
has
inherited
everything
and
who
on
top
of
that
has
been
recognized
as
a
legitimate
son
consequently
as
count
bezukhov
and
possessor
of
the
handsomest
fortune
in
russia
they
claim
that
prince
vassily
played
a
very
nasty
role
in
this
whole
story
and
that
he
has
gone
back
quite
sheepishly
to
petersburg
i
confess
to
you
that
i
understand
very
little
of
all
these
matters
of
legacies
and
wills
what
i
do
know
is
that
since
the
young
man
we
knew
simply
under
the
name
of
m
pierre
has
become
count
bezukhov
and
possessor
of
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
russia
i
have
been
much
amused
to
observe
the
changes
of
tone
and
manners
of
mamas
burdened
with
marriageable
daughters
and
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
with
regard
to
this
individual
who
parenthetically
has
always
seemed
a
poor
sort
to
me
since
people
have
amused
themselves
for
the
past
two
years
by
making
matches
for
me
that
i
mostly
knew
nothing
about
the
matrimonial
chronicle
of
moscow
is
now
making
me
countess
bezukhov
but
you
can
feel
very
well
that
i
do
not
care
at
all
to
become
that
speaking
of
marriage
do
you
know
that
the
aunt
in
generalanna
mikhailovna
under
the
seal
of
the
greatest
secrecy
has
confided
to
me
a
plan
to
get
you
married
it
is
no
more
nor
less
than
the
son
of
prince
vassily
anatole
whom
they
would
like
to
set
up
by
marrying
him
to
a
rich
and
distinguished
person
and
the
choice
of
the
parents
has
fallen
on
you
i
do
not
know
how
you
would
look
at
it
but
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
warn
you
of
it
hes
said
to
be
very
handsome
and
a
very
bad
boy
that
is
all
i
have
been
able
to
learn
about
him
but
enough
of
this
chattering
i
am
finishing
my
second
sheet
and
mama
has
sent
for
me
to
go
to
dinner
at
the
apraksins
read
the
mystical
book
i
am
sending
you
and
that
is
causing
a
furor
here
though
there
are
things
in
this
book
that
are
hard
to
grasp
with
weak
human
understanding
it
is
an
admirable
book
the
reading
of
which
calms
and
elevates
the
soul
farewell
my
respects
to
your
father
and
my
compliments
to
mlle
bourienne
i
embrace
you
as
i
love
you
julie
ps
give
me
news
of
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
wife
return
to
text
dear
and
excellent
friend
your
letter
of
the
13th
gave
me
great
joy
so
you
still
love
me
my
poetical
julie
absence
of
which
you
say
such
bad
things
has
thus
not
had
its
usual
influence
on
you
you
complain
about
absencewhat
would
i
have
to
say
if
i
dared
to
complain
deprived
of
all
those
who
are
dear
to
me
ah
if
we
did
not
have
religion
to
console
us
life
would
be
quite
sad
why
do
you
suppose
me
to
have
a
stern
look
when
you
speak
to
me
of
your
affection
for
the
young
man
in
that
connection
i
am
strict
only
with
myself
i
understand
these
feelings
in
others
and
if
i
cannot
approve
of
them
never
having
felt
them
i
do
not
condemn
them
it
only
seems
to
me
that
christian
love
the
love
of
ones
neighbor
the
love
for
ones
enemies
is
more
meritorious
sweeter
and
more
beautiful
than
are
the
feelings
that
the
beautiful
eyes
of
a
young
man
can
inspire
in
a
poetical
and
loving
young
girl
like
you
the
news
of
the
death
of
count
bezukhov
reached
us
before
your
letter
and
my
father
was
much
affected
by
it
he
says
that
he
was
the
nexttolast
representative
of
the
grand
century
and
that
now
it
is
his
turn
but
that
he
will
do
his
best
to
put
his
turn
off
as
long
as
possible
god
keeps
us
from
that
terrible
misfortune
i
cannot
share
your
opinion
of
pierre
whom
i
knew
as
a
child
he
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
excellent
heart
and
that
is
the
quality
i
esteem
the
most
in
people
as
for
his
inheritance
and
the
role
prince
vassily
played
in
it
it
is
a
sad
thing
for
them
both
ah
dear
friend
the
word
of
our
divine
savior
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
pass
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
god
that
word
is
terribly
true
i
pity
prince
vassily
and
i
feel
even
sorrier
for
pierre
so
young
and
burdened
with
such
wealth
what
temptations
he
will
have
to
endure
if
i
were
asked
what
i
would
like
most
in
the
world
it
would
be
to
be
poorer
than
the
poorest
beggar
a
thousand
thanks
dear
friend
for
the
work
you
have
sent
me
and
which
is
causing
such
a
furor
there
however
since
you
tell
me
that
amidst
several
good
things
there
are
others
that
weak
human
understanding
cannot
grasp
it
would
seem
to
me
rather
useless
to
occupy
myself
with
unintelligible
reading
matter
which
by
that
very
fact
cannot
be
of
any
fruit
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
the
passion
certain
persons
have
for
muddling
their
wits
by
fastening
upon
mystical
books
which
only
awaken
doubts
in
their
minds
excite
their
imagination
and
give
them
an
exaggerated
character
totally
contrary
to
christian
simplicity
let
us
read
the
apostles
and
the
gospel
let
us
not
seek
to
penetrate
what
they
contain
of
the
mysterious
for
how
should
we
dare
aspire
miserable
sinners
that
we
are
to
initiate
ourselves
into
the
terrible
and
sacred
secrets
of
providence
so
long
as
we
wear
this
fleshly
husk
which
raises
an
impenetrable
veil
between
us
and
the
eternal
let
us
limit
ourselves
then
to
studying
the
sublime
principles
that
our
divine
savior
has
left
us
for
our
conduct
here
below
let
us
seek
to
conform
ourselves
to
them
and
to
follow
them
let
us
persuade
ourselves
that
the
less
flight
we
give
to
our
weak
human
spirit
the
more
pleasing
it
is
to
god
who
rejects
all
science
that
does
not
come
from
him
that
the
less
we
seek
to
delve
into
what
he
has
been
pleased
to
conceal
from
our
knowledge
the
sooner
he
will
grant
us
the
discovery
of
it
through
his
divine
spirit
my
father
did
not
speak
to
me
of
the
suitor
he
only
told
me
that
he
had
received
a
letter
and
was
awaiting
a
visit
from
prince
vassily
as
for
the
marriage
plan
regarding
me
i
shall
tell
you
dear
and
excellent
friend
that
for
me
marriage
is
a
divine
institution
to
which
one
must
conform
oneself
however
painful
it
may
be
for
me
if
the
almighty
ever
imposes
upon
me
the
duties
of
a
wife
and
mother
i
shall
try
to
fulfill
them
as
faithfully
as
i
can
without
troubling
myself
with
the
examination
of
my
feelings
regarding
him
whom
he
will
give
me
for
a
husband
i
have
received
a
letter
from
my
brother
who
announces
his
arrival
at
bald
hills
with
his
wife
this
will
be
a
shortlived
joy
since
he
is
leaving
us
to
take
this
wretched
war
into
which
we
are
being
dragged
god
knows
how
or
why
not
just
with
you
there
in
the
center
of
affairs
and
of
the
world
is
there
talk
only
of
war
but
here
in
the
midst
of
these
rural
labors
and
this
calm
of
nature
which
city
dwellers
usually
picture
to
themselves
in
the
country
the
noise
of
war
makes
itself
heard
and
felt
painfully
my
father
speaks
of
nothing
but
marches
and
countermarches
things
of
which
i
have
no
understanding
and
the
day
before
yesterday
while
going
for
my
usual
stroll
along
the
village
street
i
was
witness
to
a
heartrending
sceneit
was
a
convoy
of
recruits
enlisted
from
our
estate
and
being
sent
off
to
the
armyyou
should
have
seen
the
state
that
the
mothers
the
wives
the
children
of
these
departing
men
were
in
and
heard
the
sobs
on
both
sides
you
would
think
that
humanity
has
forgotten
the
laws
of
its
divine
savior
who
preached
love
and
the
forgiveness
of
transgressions
and
that
it
finds
its
greatest
merit
in
the
art
of
mutual
killing
farewell
dear
and
good
friend
may
our
divine
savior
and
his
most
holy
mother
keep
you
in
their
holy
and
powerful
care

since
our
great
successes
at
austerlitz
you
know
my
dear
prince
that
i
no
longer
leave
general
headquarters
i
have
decidedly
gotten
the
taste
for
war
and
have
really
taken
to
it
what
ive
seen
in
these
three
months
is
incredible
ill
begin
ab
ovothe
enemy
of
the
human
race
as
you
know
is
attacking
the
prussians
the
prussians
are
our
faithful
allies
who
have
betrayed
us
only
three
times
in
three
years
we
take
up
their
cause
but
it
turns
out
that
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
pays
no
attention
to
our
fine
speeches
and
in
his
savage
and
impolite
manner
falls
upon
the
prussians
without
giving
them
time
to
finish
the
parade
theyve
begun
beats
the
stuffing
out
of
them
in
two
seconds
and
installs
himself
in
the
palace
at
potsdam
i
have
the
strongest
desire
the
king
of
prussia
writes
to
bonaparte
that
your
majesty
be
welcomed
and
treated
in
my
palace
in
a
manner
agreeable
to
him
and
to
that
end
i
have
hastened
to
take
all
the
measures
which
circumstances
allowed
i
hope
to
have
succeeded
the
prussian
generals
pride
themselves
on
their
politeness
towards
the
french
and
lay
down
their
arms
at
the
first
invitation
the
head
of
the
garrison
at
glogau
with
ten
thousand
men
asks
the
king
of
prussia
what
to
do
if
he
is
invited
to
surrenderall
this
is
undeniable
in
short
hoping
to
impress
only
by
our
military
bearing
it
turns
out
that
we
find
ourselves
at
war
in
earnest
and
whats
more
at
war
on
our
own
frontiers
with
and
for
the
king
of
prussia
we
have
everything
we
only
lack
one
little
thing
a
commander
in
chief
since
it
has
been
found
that
the
successes
at
austerlitz
would
have
been
more
decisive
if
the
commander
in
chief
had
been
less
young
they
make
a
review
of
all
the
octogenarians
and
between
prozorovsky
and
kamensky
give
the
preference
to
the
latter
the
general
comes
to
us
in
a
kibitka
like
suvorov
and
is
welcomed
with
acclamations
of
joy
and
triumph
on
the
4th
the
first
mail
arrives
from
petersburg
the
pouches
are
taken
to
the
office
of
the
marshal
who
likes
doing
everything
himself
i
am
sent
for
to
help
sort
the
letters
and
take
those
intended
for
us
the
marshal
watches
us
work
and
waits
for
the
packets
addressed
to
him
we
searchthere
arent
any
the
marshal
grows
impatient
sets
to
work
himself
and
finds
letters
from
the
emperor
to
count
t
to
prince
v
and
others
then
he
gets
into
one
of
his
blue
fits
he
breathes
fire
and
flame
on
everybody
seizes
the
letters
unseals
them
and
reads
those
the
emperor
has
addressed
to
othersand
he
writes
the
famous
order
of
the
day

general
bennigsen
return

he
wrote
to
the
emperor
return
to

the
marshal
is
angry
with
the
emperor
and
is
punishing
us
all
isnt
that
logical
there
you
have
the
first
act
in
those
that
follow
the
interest
and
the
ridiculousness
increase
as
you
might
expect
after
the
marshals
departure
it
turns
out
that
we
are
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
must
offer
battle
buxh246wden
is
commander
in
chief
by
right
of
seniority
but
general
bennigsen
is
not
of
that
opinion
the
more
so
as
it
is
he
with
his
corps
that
is
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
he
wants
to
profit
from
the
occasion
of
a
battle
on
his
own
hand
as
the
germans
say
he
offers
it
this
is
the
battle
of
pultusk
which
is
considered
to
be
a
great
victory
but
which
in
my
opinion
is
not
one
at
all
we
muftis
have
as
you
know
a
very
nasty
habit
of
deciding
the
winning
or
losing
of
a
battle
he
who
retreats
after
the
battle
has
lost
it
thats
what
we
say
and
on
that
head
we
have
lost
the
battle
of
pultusk
in
short
we
retreat
after
the
battle
but
we
sent
a
courier
to
petersburg
with
news
of
a
victory
and
the
general
does
not
yield
up
the
chief
command
to
buxh246wden
hoping
to
receive
from
petersburg
the
title
of
commander
in
chief
in
recognition
of
his
victory
during
this
interregnum
we
begin
an
excessively
interesting
and
original
plan
of
maneuvres
our
aim
does
not
consist
as
it
should
of
evading
or
attacking
the
enemy
but
solely
of
evading
general
buxh246wden
who
by
right
of
seniority
should
be
our
chief
we
pursue
this
goal
with
so
much
energy
that
in
crossing
a
river
that
is
not
fordable
we
burn
our
bridges
to
separate
ourselves
from
the
enemy
who
for
the
moment
is
not
bonaparte
but
buxh246wden
general
buxh246wden
was
nearly
attacked
and
taken
by
superior
enemy
forces
because
of
one
of
our
pretty
maneuvres
that
saved
us
from
him
buxh246wden
pursues
uswe
slip
away
he
has
barely
crossed
to
our
side
of
the
river
when
we
cross
back
again
in
the
end
our
enemy
buxh246wden
catches
us
and
attacks
us
the
two
generals
become
angry
there
is
even
a
challenge
to
a
duel
on
buxh246wdens
an
attack
of
epilepsy
on
bennigsens
part
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
courier
who
brought
the
news
of
our
victory
at
pultusk
brings
us
from
petersburg
our
nomination
as
commander
in
chief
and
the
first
enemy
buxh246wden
is
sunk
we
can
think
about
the
second
bonaparte
but
lo
and
behold
if
a
third
enemy
doesnt
rise
up
before
us
the
orthodox
armed
forces
with
loud
cries
for
bread
meat
biscuits
fodderand
whatnot
else
the
stocks
are
empty
the
roads
are
impracticable
the
orthodox
armed
forces
start
looting
and
in
a
way
of
which
the
last
campaign
cannot
give
you
the
least
idea
half
the
regiments
form
free
bands
which
roam
the
countryside
putting
everything
to
fire
and
sword
the
inhabitants
are
utterly
ruined
the
hospitals
overflow
with
sick
and
there
is
famine
everywhere
twice
general
headquarters
has
been
attacked
by
bands
of
looters
and
the
commander
in
chief
has
asked
for
a
battalion
to
drive
them
away
in
one
of
those
attacks
they
carried
off
my
empty
trunk
and
my
dressing
gown
the
emperor
wants
to
give
the
heads
of
divisions
the
right
to
shoot
the
looters
but
im
very
much
afraid
that
this
will
oblige

half

shoot

monsieur
my

i
learned
yesterday
that
despite
the
loyalty
with
which
i
have
kept
my
promises
to
your
majesty
your
troops
have
crossed
the
borders
of
russia
and
i
have
just
received
a
note
from
petersburg
in
which
count
lauriston
announces
as
the
cause
of
this
aggression
that
your
majesty
has
considered
himself
in
a
state
of
war
with
me
from
the
moment
when
prince
kurakin
asked
for
his
passports
the
motives
upon
which
the
duke
of
bassano
based
his
refusal
to
deliver
them
to
him
would
never
have
made
me
suppose
that
this
step
could
ever
serve
as
a
pretext
for
aggression
indeed
this
ambassador
was
never
authorized
to
take
it
as
he
has
declared
himself
and
as
soon
as
i
was
informed
of
it
i
made
known
to
him
how
much
i
disapproved
of
him
by
ordering
him
to
remain
at
his
post
if
your
majesty
is
not
intent
on
shedding
the
blood
of
our
peoples
for
a
misunderstanding
of
this
sort
and
consents
to
withdraw
his
troops
from
russian
territory
i
will
regard
what
has
occurred
as
cancelled
and
an
agreement
between
us
will
be
possible
in
the
contrary
case
your
majesty
i
will
find
myself
forced
to
repel
an
attack

nothing
on

it
still
depends
on

i
believe
it
my
duty
to
inform
your
majesty
of
the
state
of
his
troops
in
the
different
corps
of
the
army
that
i
have
been
able
to
observe
over
the
past
two
or
three
days
in
different
visits
they
are
on
the
point
of
disbanding
the
number
of
soldiers
following
the
colors
is
in
the
proportion
of
a
quarter
at
most
in
almost
all
the
regiments
the
rest
march
separately
in
different
directions
and
on
their
own
in
the
hope
of
finding
subsistence
and
to
be
rid
of
discipline
in
general
they
consider
smolensk
as
the
point
where
they
must
recuperate
in
the
last
few
days
many
soldiers
have
been
seen
throwing
down
their
cartridges
and
weapons
in
this
state
of
affairs
the
interest
of
your
majestys
service
whatever
his
further
plans
demands
that
we
rally
the
army
at
smolensk
beginning
by
ridding
it
of
noncombatants
such
as
men
without
horses
and
of
useless
baggage
and
the
artillery
mat233riel
which
is
no
longer
in
proportion
to
our
present
forces
besides
days
of
rest
subsistence
is
also
necessary
for
the
soldiers
who
are
exhausted
by
hunger
and
fatigue
many
have
died
over
these
last
days
on
the
road
and
in
the
bivouacs
this
state
of
affairs
keeps
worsening
and
makes
one
fear
that
if
a
prompt
remedy
is
not
applied
one
will
no
longer
be
in
control
of
the
troops
in
case
of
combat
